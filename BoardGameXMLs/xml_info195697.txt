			<description>Across eight turns, you will live out your life in a city somewhere in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn represents a phase in one&amp;rsquo;s life:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Starting Out&lt;br/&gt;    2. Meeting that special someone&lt;br/&gt;    3. Settling down with that special someone&lt;br/&gt;    4. Kids arrive (by birth, adoption or otherwise)&lt;br/&gt;    5. Kids grow up to be teenagers&lt;br/&gt;    6. Kids leave home, the nest is empty&lt;br/&gt;    7. Getting old&lt;br/&gt;    8. Approaching this life&amp;rsquo;s end&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a five by five tile 'city' - with 13 fixed tiles (representing CBD, four inner suburbs, four outer suburbs and four corner 'holiday home' locations) and 12 Modifiable (Mod) tiles which represent different landmarks (for example restaurant, art gallery, rubbish dump etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Mod tile has a scoring value each turn, which can change depending on the turn (phase of life) you are in. For example living near a retirement home scores well in later rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start the game with a house in an inner suburb. Players draft a hand of 'mod' tiles which allow them to modify the landmarks on the board (for example turn a park into a 'fancy' park, which scores more highly) - they also receive one temporary closure tile (means a tile is not scored for the current round) and one demolition tile (which permanently removes a Mod tile and replaces it with one from the side of the board).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your objective is to optimise where you live in relation to your particular stage in life, and this is scored at the end of each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you either:&lt;br/&gt;1. Move house&lt;br/&gt;2. Buy a holiday home (allowing you to place a second home on a corner of the board and then score the adjacent tiles each turn) - you may only perform this action once per game, or&lt;br/&gt;3. Modify a Mod tile&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You cannot pass in Living.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you then score the tiles orthogonally adjacent to your home and your holiday home (if you have one).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the eighth turn, the highest score wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
