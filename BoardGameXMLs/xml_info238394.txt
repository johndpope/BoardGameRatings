			<description>(Re-)Discover the exploratory joys of some classic literary adventures through this card game. Players build a hand of descriptive elements from a constantly cycling pool to recreate iconic scenes - focused around landscape description featured in the works. These in turn are used to strategically claim chapters from a random set that match the environmental types of the scenes they have developed, before their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The closer the match of the words played to the actual text, the higher the score - but beware of claiming too many chapters with fuzzy 'not-quite-right' elements, for the scoring system favours those whose scenes require the least edits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features basic and advanced scoring rules, to allow players of all ages to enjoy the (dare we say, educational) game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first text featured in this gaming system is: R.L.Stevenson's Treasure Island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
