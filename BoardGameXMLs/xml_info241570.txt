			<description>This is a light weight racing game for the light hearted. Racing around the track trying to get first over the finishing line as you are pumping up the steam in your engine and knocking out the others out of the way. But be aware that you will lose if you run out of fuel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A kids and family racing game introducing resource management for younger players. Fuel the car engine to move, the more you feed the engine the faster it could go, but as hotter it gets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manage your resources and roll to move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bild your own racing tracks with the modular boards, customise your vehicles, manage the resources, nock the other cars out of track or try to break them and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slogan: Racing for glory, win with luck and planing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theme: Car race&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to win: First to move over the finishing line of the final lap is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
