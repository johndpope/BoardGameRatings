							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sudden Strike II</name>
									
			<description>The Sudden Strike series is a collection of real-time tactics (RTT) computer games set in World War II. The player selects a faction (e.g. Soviets, Germans, or Allied forces) and gains control of many varied units such as infantry, tanks and artillery. The games focus primarily on tactics, eschewing traditional real-time strategy resource gathering and base development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sudden Strike 2 was developed by Russian developer Fireglow and published by CDV and was released in 2002. &lt;br/&gt;The campaigns involve the Soviets and Allies, against the Germans and Japan. While striving for historical accuracy, the missions are mostly fiction. The American missions are in the Rhine regions and tend to involve 'borrowing' war equipment from the German army rather than using their own tanks and other weapons. The British missions revolve around the actual events at Wolfheze and Arnhem and the attempted capture of the bridge. The Japanese missions are centered along the lines of tropical jungle warfare and the use of tanks is somewhat limited whereas the Soviet campaign is based on the capture of the city of Kharkov and other battles along the Dniepr river waged by the Soviet Red Army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Sudden Strike , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
