							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dream TV</name>
									
			<description>Dream TV is a Super Nintendo action video game where the player has to guide two youngsters through a nightmarish land of evil television shows (using a similar plot to the campy movie Stay Tuned). The player has to escape by defeating stereotypical television villains and finding pieces of a puzzle. The game features complex labyrinths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;National video gamers Charlie and Jimmy are given a strange game in the mail. After loading a strange-looking game cartridge, the boys find themselves transported into the game. They are sucked in by an evil being known as the Critic. Now Jimmy and Charlie must fight for their lives through four Dream Worlds (Medieval, Egyptian, Prehistoric, and Future) if they hope to return home safely. Collecting nine hidden puzzle pieces from each level will take the guys to the final showdown with the Critic and hopefully back to reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dream TV&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
