							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Operation: Burning Presidents (Covert Ops)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operative John Dixon (code name FOXTROT) has gone missing.  He was engaged on a crucial mission tracking down connections between an organized crime family and a terrorist organization active on U.S. soil known as the Freedom Brigade.  As the operatives track down Dixon's location, they learn of a pending plot that only they are in a position to stop.  If they are too late, Dixon will surely die and the world will watch powerless as presidents burn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Short Assignment for Covert Ops role-playing game, a series of very short missions that require little preparation time for the GM, allowing players to get right into the fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expect many more Short Assignments from DwD Studios. But don&amp;rsquo;t just sit around waiting for us to make them; this is a Creative Commons product, after all! Check out the guidelines at the above link and write one yourself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
