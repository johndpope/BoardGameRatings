							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle of Thermopylae (EGS)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a distant, possible future, it&amp;rsquo;s the year 1077 AF. After more than a thousand years, the Heavenly Contest ended without a winner. Zeus resides on the throne of Olympus, but during the extenuating struggle, the gods lost much of their power and influence over the Cosmos and humans. People now rely on philosophy and reason, deserting the temples. Demigods are no longer born and less heroic deeds are regularly performed to please the gods. While the Olympians are looking for a way to regain their former influence over the Cosmos, a new rising god from the east threatens the safety of Hellas and wishes to destroy the twelve Olympians. Ahura Mazda, god of the Persians, challenges Zeus while inciting his followers to conquer the Cosmos to become its only ruler. King Xerxes, son of Darius, leads a huge army against Hellas while Ahura Mazda fights with his Daevas against the Olympians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Persian army is moving on Hellas; King Leonidas marches his Spartan army to the pass of Thermopylae after building an army of Hellenes. But treason is brewing, and it's up to our heroes to turn the tide. The PCs are ripped from the past and thrown into this distant future with one goal: stop the treason and rally the Hellenes to victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle of Thermopylae is an epic adventure for Mythos for 3-5 Veteran heroes. Although Mythos takes place during the time of the Heavenly Contest, the gods throw the PCs into the future to fight for Hellas and hopefully turn the tide at Thermopylae. Can they infiltrate the Persian camp and save the day?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
