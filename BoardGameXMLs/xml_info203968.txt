			<description>Players take on the role of an adventurer and explore the manor room by room. They have to avoid the spooky creatures that live inside to discover its secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a memory card based game containing 36 Castle Cards these are split into monsters, doorways, candles, potions, maps and a portcullis. Players shuffle the cards a construct a 6x6 grid by looking at the cards before placing them face down with the first card in the middle of the table. As other cards are placed have to touch the edge of another card. Doorways however are placed face up to begin with and where possible should not be placed next to each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last player to add a card picks the doorway they wish to start on and the remaining doors are turned face down. Players move around the board by moving to the next face down card in a straight line (Up, down, left or right). Face up cards or spaces can be jumped over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During play if a monster is flipped over and the same monster is also in the row or column then the player gets &amp;quot;scared&amp;quot; and has to take the monster card they landed on. The player then runs to a face up door card that has no current players on it. There are also bonus cards that have special effects when activated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when players can no longer move as there are no cards remaining face down. To win players count the scores on the monsters they collected and the lowest score wins. If there is a draw then the last player that had a turn wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
