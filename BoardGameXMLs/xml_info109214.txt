			<description>Simulation of 3 sport games: soccer, basketball, hockey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players subsequently move all they players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soccer: Each player has 10 players and goalkeeper on the pitch. Goalkeeper cannot move out of penalty area. During each turn players can run with ball (max. 6 hexes), pass to another man (at most for 10 hexes) or shoot (max. 10 hexes). Each pass can be blocked if opponent is next to the line of the pass. If on the line of the pass - opponent always steals the ball. Rules saving a shot by goalkeeper are the same, but there's possibility to score the goal even if he's on the line of the shot. There are also tackles, fouls, outs and penalties, but no yellow/red cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basketball: each player has 5 players. Players can move at most 3 hexes (no dice rolling), shoot, or pass. Defenders can steal a ball only during a pass or a shot (blocking it or rebounding), and if they're next to a player passing the ball or the one that catches it. There are steals, fouls and rebounds. Scoring is for 1, 2 and 3 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hockey: each player has 5 players and goalkeeper. Goalkeeper cannot move out of the goal area. Moves, shoots and passes for maximum 6 hexes. All rules are combination of soccer and basketball rules written above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player wins after determined time or result. Producer recommends 2x30 min for soccer, 3x20 for hockey and 2x20 for basketball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanic: each action is decided by dice. In soccer - 1-2 dices, other sports: 1 dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 sided board: on one side there's soccer pitch, on second - basketball and hockey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
