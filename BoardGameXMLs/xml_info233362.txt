							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Feudal Feud</name>
									
			<description>Feudal Feud is an upcoming and free diplomacy, conquest and strategy mobile and browser game. It is a wargame lite played in real-time over a period of a few weeks. You share a map with 100 other players with whom you'll need to negotiate, ally and schemes to dominate the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players you conquer become your vassals. But you'll have to convince them not to revolt if you wish to truly establish your hegemony. However, limited life expectancy means that keeping your strengths and waiting for the death of your own liege may sometime be a better course of action than openly revolting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Noteworthy mechanics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-   Grow as much as possible in an ever-shifting player-made political landscape.&lt;br/&gt;-   Players you conquer become your vassals.&lt;br/&gt;-   Try to focus them on your objectives instead of fighting each other.&lt;br/&gt;-   Revolt against your own liege to gain independence, or bid your time and prepare yourself for his inevitable death.&lt;br/&gt;-   Unlock new buildings in your capital by controlling as much territory as possible through your vassals.&lt;br/&gt;-   Unlock global talents that are carried over in every game you play.&lt;br/&gt;-   Unlock city types with different objectives for your next games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feudal Feud was a successfully funded Kickstarter campaign and won SlideDB.com's first place award for best upcoming game in 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
