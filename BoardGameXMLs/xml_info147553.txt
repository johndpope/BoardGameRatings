			<description>Kilimanjaro is a game that teaches about African and African-American history and traditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a basic roll-and-move game with spaces that cause you to draw and read cards that are either informational and earn you points automatically, or players must answer the question to receive 5 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game you roll to determine your 'name' based on the day of the week (you get the appropriate male or female name for that particular day) OR you can choose the 7th day (since you cannot roll it) if you prefer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You then progress down different tracks and read about or answer questions about Ghana. Some spaces give you points automatically, some tell you to draw a card, some do nothing, and some will tell you to go to other spaces on the board (generally further back) - however you win by getting the most points, NOT by finishing first, so this isn't necessarily bad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of your trek around the board, you come to the 'Self Reliance' square where you 'wish' on a star (choose one of 3) and then attempt to roll one of the two numbers on it (they have 1-6, 2-5 and 3-4 on them) If you roll correctly you collect the points and you are done. Otherwise you draw a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 2 players have landed on their wished star, the game ends. The player obtaining the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A Game Board&lt;br/&gt;     64 cards&lt;br/&gt;     5 marbles (pawns)&lt;br/&gt;     1 Die (D6)&lt;br/&gt;     Instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
