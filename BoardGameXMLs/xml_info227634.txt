							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guild Ball: Alchemists Starter Set</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alchemists&amp;rsquo; play style is one of force projection. They utilise a lot of AOE to control space and deny their opponents manoeuvrability. Their combo play comes from layering AOEs and generating huge areas of danger across the pitch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are quick on their feet and capable with the ball, but not as resilient in combat as other teams. They excel in the early to mid-game due to their ability to cover a good amount of space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alchemists will reward players who can anticipate their opponent&amp;rsquo;s plans and block them through good placement and positioning of models and effects. On offense, Alchemists can use their AOEs almost as additional models in order to restrict the counter play options of their opponent. No one wants to charge the Alchemist with the ball if you have to go through an acid cloud!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What nature provides, man can improve. The Alchemists know this well and it is reflected in the scientific marvels they bring to the Guild Ball pitch. Watching the Alchemists play is part carnival, part fireworks, part illusion. The crowds cheer in awe at the visual spectacle as fireballs, smoke clouds, and slick oils dominate the field of play, delighting the children, decimating the opposition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flexibility is the watchword of an Alchemist's Guild coach. In Midas, Calculus, and Mercury you have all the ingredients for the purest of alloys, a team that can be much greater than the sum of its parts. Whether you are blinding the enemy with oil or turning them into little more than human candles, the Alchemists will always have a response to any play; their vast knowledge putting them one step ahead of the rest of the pack with every kick of the ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set provides you with all you need to start playing the Alchemist's Guild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
