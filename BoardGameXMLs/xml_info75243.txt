			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster and the Beanstalk is the only Tiny Toon Adventures-related video game released on the Personal Computer. It was developed and published by Terraglyph Interactive Studios in 1996&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a PlayStation game called Tiny Toon Adventures: The Great Beanstalk that is very similar to this game, although different enough to warrant its own VGG page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay &amp;amp; Story&lt;br/&gt;If one was take the old Jack and the Beanstalk story and add Tiny Toon Adventures, you will get exactly what makes Buster and the Beanstalk. The object of the game is help two stars from the show, Buster Bunny and Plucky Duck, get into the Giant's castle. This is done by finding pieces of the keys needed, which is found by using hints given over a loudspeaker (by Babs Bunny). Players point and click on objects found in each scene of the game, using those hints. If they find the right object told in the hint, they find a piece of the key they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three total keys to build on easy mode, but changing it to hard can give the player a longer adventure. But if a player gets stuck, The beautiful, magical fairy princess (aka Babs Bunny) gives the heroes at the beginning of the game a magical cell phone that they can use to get unstuck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, Elmyra Duff takes the role of a magical witch that can capture Buster and Plucky, hindering their quest for a bit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
