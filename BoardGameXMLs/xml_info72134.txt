							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Peter the Great: Warpspawn card game</name>
									
			<description>Players bid on cards representing various events during the reign of Peter the Great.  Successful bids capture cards which generate victory points symbolizing accomplishments in the modernization of Imperial Russia.  Cards with Peter himself don't generate victory points, but rather grant advantageous contingencies.  There are 10 cards in each of 7 suites, unlike most Warpspawn card games there aren't different &amp;quot;force&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;power&amp;quot; levels for different cards.  The bidding requires different colored cubes picked at random, a unique mechanism in which high bid is most-cubes-of-that-color rather than most-play-money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
