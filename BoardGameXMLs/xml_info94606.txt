							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The 6th Seal</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and lo, there was a great earthquake: and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;~Revelations 6:12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sixth Seal is a supplement for M&amp;amp;M Superlink that focuses on how heroes deal with a disaster of epic proportions and its apocalyptic aftermath. It contains several adventures that can be played together as a story arc or individually, at the GM's discretion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Section 1 sets the scene and has adventure scenarios that take place in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Section 2 gives background information on life in the wake of the disaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Section 3 provides adventure scenarios that take place a few weeks or even months after the quake strikes, when civilization has effectively collapsed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, The Sixth Seal provides several additional &amp;quot;Seasoning encounters&amp;quot; - straightforward, quick-play adventure scenarios that provide additional depth or flavor, and an alternate plotline in which the earthquake only impacts the heroes' home city, rather than the nation as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
