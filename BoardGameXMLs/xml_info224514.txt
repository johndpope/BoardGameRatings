			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mist blanketed the plateau, chilling and damp, causing Selisa to shiver as she and a dozen other newly arrived treasure hunters stood before the Huldra. The witch's firm eyes glared at them from behind her mask, assessing them one by one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s going on?&amp;rdquo; Galar whispered. &amp;ldquo;We haven&amp;rsquo;t done any&amp;ndash;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Selisa silenced her fellow explorer with a discreet kick to his shin. This was hardly the time for arguing. One barely dared to even breathe. The feeling of uneasiness grew stronger as the Arch Witch&amp;rsquo;s gaze fell on Galar, and darkened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; The voice was hateful and as accusatory as the bony finger that pointed at Selisa's friend. &amp;ldquo;You are the prey.&amp;rdquo; The witch turned to the wrathguard accompanying her, whose hands rested easily on the handle of his axe. &amp;ldquo;Take him away. And his companions too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before Selisa or Galar had time to react, before the wrathguard had taken so much as a step towards them, the clear clang of a lonely bell cut through the air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The witch flinched, then glanced at the tower balancing on the edge of the plateau, ten steps away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Too late&amp;rdquo;, she hissed, turning to those gathered before her. &amp;ldquo;Now plunderers, fight or die! The darkness you have awoken is upon us!&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Karvosti &amp;ndash; The Witch Hammer invites you to join the treasure hunt of a lifetime! Between these covers you will find not only the epic and action-packed adventure The Witch Hammer, but also nearly a hundred pages of campaign material describing the cliff of Karvosti and its surrounding area, including an extensive section with new rules and guidelines pertinent to the setting and adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featured content:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Witch Hammer &amp;ndash; the most dire and perilous treasure hunt since the days of Symbaroum.&lt;br/&gt;    An extended account of the history, activities, factions and conflicts of the Karvosti region, to be read by both players and Game Masters.&lt;br/&gt;    Twenty unique establishments where player characters may rest, eat, drink, gather information or seek an audience with local dignitaries.&lt;br/&gt;    A comprehensive chapter for the Game Master, describing what lurks beneath the region&amp;rsquo;s surface, with plenty of plot hooks to develop into adventures or entire campaigns. &lt;br/&gt;    Guidelines on how to handle the exploration of ruins and the scheming going on in Symbaroum, plus plenty of additional rules including new abilities, traits, elixirs, artifacts, monsters and enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
