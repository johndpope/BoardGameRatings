							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Millionaire</name>
									
			<description>In this game players try to spell the word &amp;quot;Millionaire&amp;quot;. Each player is dealt 7 letter cards. To start, you begin by laying down the letter &amp;quot;M&amp;quot; and any other letters (in sequence) that you can. If you cannot make a play, you draw a card instead. The other players also add letters to the word (if possible) on their turns. When the word &amp;quot;Millionaire&amp;quot; is spelled out, the player having the fewest cards left in his or her hand scores points equal to all the cards left in the opponent's hands. The first player to score 75 points is the winner. Rules for playing &amp;quot;Card Anagrams&amp;quot; are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
