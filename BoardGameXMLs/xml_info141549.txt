			<description>Unusual game intended for a communist state as East Germany was at the ime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with 10,000 Deutschmarks. The board has a long track that, at times, offers a short or long route (and on two places a third track is offered). Movement is by a die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At several points there are numbers. These numbers relate to cards (there are thus 26 cards and 26 special spaces). Before you start on a short or longer path, you can look at the numbers on such a track. This might imfluence your decision. A general rule is that the longer the track taken, the more your money is secure. However there are bonuses to be earned by finishing the track quickly. So you must balance speed against risk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all the players have finished, money is counted up and the player with the most Deutschmarks, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
