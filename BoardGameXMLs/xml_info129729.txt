							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chasing Yello</name>
									
			<description>Yello and his mischievous seven-year-old owner, Mathilda, return in this endless runner game for iPhone and iPad. This time Yello&amp;rsquo;s impish owner lets him have a taste a freedom in a local wild creek where he must jump and dive over obstacles such as rocks, logs and even piranhas in order to escape Mathilda&amp;rsquo;s fishing net! Featuring simple tilt and swipe controls, players must help little Yello navigate through the environmental dangers of the creek while collecting as many stars as possible, which can be used to purchase in-game power-ups and unlock goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, levels are never quite the same twice in a row, so players must perfect timing and balance in order to collect the most stars and keep Yello on the move. An online leaderboard allows Yello fans to post high scores and other achievements as well as capability to connect with fellow players through Facebook and Twitter. Will Yello escape to freedom, succumb to the hazardous environment or fall victim Mathilda&amp;rsquo;s fishing net?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
