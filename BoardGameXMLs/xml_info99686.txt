			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Battleground: A growing abscess, perilously close to the human heart. An invasion of lethal virus, multiplying faster than the body's warrior leukocytes can destroy them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Mission: Shrink down, down, down. Smaller than a speck of dust. Board a microscopic submarine. And navigate through the bloodstream until you encounter your deadly foes. Any volunteers?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Million to One: Those are the odds against you. Even though you're fast, tough, and smart. You're simply outnumbered. And the enemy is tough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bad Guys: Fiendish virus. Tough to kill, too. A direct hit with a penicillin torpedo divides the colony. Hit again, and they divide into creepy little virus. A third blast pulls their plugs for good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of them just cruise along attacking their host's cells. But watch out for a particularly nasty number who goes&lt;br/&gt;straight for your throat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
