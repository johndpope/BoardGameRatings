			<description>In November of 1950, the United Nations counteroffensive against the North Koreans seemed to be in the final stages of a mop-up. Everywhere the Inmun Gun (the North Korean Army) was in full retreat toward the Chinese border, closely pursued by the victorious Allies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chinese intervention in the war had been considered and dismissed as a bluff by the UN Command. Thus, the UN forces were badly overextended when the bluff materialized as a force of thirty divisions, having infiltrated into the Korean mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UN forces were sent reeling back to the 38th Parallel in confusion, attempting to reestablish a front line. The Communists followed relentlessly, infiltrating deep into UN positions. They attacked without caution, accepting high casualties in order to sustain momentum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units in Yalu are mostly divisions, with some regiments and battalions. Ground scale is 10 miles per hex and turns are weekly. Weather plays a predominant role, influencing movement and combat options for both sides. Yalu, like no other game, effectively shows the differences in the opposing sides' Rules of Engagement - the two sides simply feel and play differently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the second edition of Yalu; the first was published in GDW's Conflict Games line in 1977. The 2009, Second Edition of Yalu will be a fully updated version of the game with all new graphics, all known errata included and some additional rule updates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both &amp;quot;New-Look&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Retro-Look&amp;quot; components. Second Edition Yalu has both &amp;quot;New-Look&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Retro-Look&amp;quot; map and counters to provide some replay variability. The 1977 rules and the new rules will also be featured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Yalu: The Chinese Counteroffensive in Korea, November 1950 to May 1951&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
