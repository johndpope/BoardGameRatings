							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oldskull Dungeon Bestiary</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the tome of dragons deep,&lt;br/&gt;This is the book of the orcish blade ...&lt;br/&gt;Bloodied leer of cavern troll,&lt;br/&gt;Canticle of the underworld.&lt;br/&gt;Graven by the hand of Fate,&lt;br/&gt;Beheld by Balor's crimson eye ...&lt;br/&gt;This is the jeweled crown and key,&lt;br/&gt;Death chant of the dungeon beast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major companion work to the well-received CLASSIC DUNGEON DESIGN GUIDE series, this epic bestiary is the great compendium of monsters, dragons, devils, and all the eldritch horrors who haunt the netherworld.  This massive tome is an ideal work for Game Masters conducting pen-and-paper Fantasy Role-Playing Games.  Now, with one huge resource, you can populate your entire mega-dungeon in record time with 79 different random encounter tables, 5,000 different classic encounters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE OLDSKULL DUNGEON BESTIARY is not only the greatest dungeon encounter generator of all time.  This book also includes over 450 monsters and citations for over 1,000 subspecies, all derived from an exhaustive research project which explored the depths of folklore, demonology, occultism and world mythology.  This tome includes one of the most detailed analyses of FRPG links to real-world folklore and netherworld grimoires ever published.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At hundreds of pages, THE OLDSKULL DUNGEON BESTIARY is both exhaustively comprehensive and easy to use.  Two different random encounter systems are included to meet the harried GM&amp;rsquo;s needs.  The first, Oldskull Impious, is designed to give immediate results for improvised encounters on a moment&amp;rsquo;s notice; the second, Oldskull Magnus, is a complex long-form 200-page system with one of the most extensively researched selections of old school dungeon monsters ever offered.  Iconic monster pairings for &amp;ldquo;dual encounters&amp;rdquo; (such as ghuls and ghasts, evil elves and giant spiders, fire giants and hell hounds, and so forth) are also featured, and balanced for inclusion in any dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best of all, the CASTLE OLDSKULL series is also system-neutral.  No matter which of the many FRPGs you choose to play, from basic skill level to advanced, a first edition or a fifth or anything in between, the lessons you master here will serve you in your gaming for years to come.  Learn how to make the most of your ever-dwindling prep time, so that you can spend those saved hours gaming with your friends!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
