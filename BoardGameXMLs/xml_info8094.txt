			<description>NOVIB is an organisation that battles poverty and injustice in third world countries. They published this game as a means to collect funds and to educate people about the economic problems in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is basically monopoly, with some changes:&lt;br/&gt;- After the first round, your income is determined by means of the resources (&amp;quot;streets&amp;quot;) bought in the first round. The resources you have have to match those of existing countries; each player selects the best (richest) country that matches his resources. A richer country means a higher &amp;quot;salary&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;- The goal of the game is to become a multinational (that is, have a set of resources complete). At this point, you are no longer a single country, but a multinational (With the highest salary in the game). If you manage to keep this title long enough, you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;- When you land a street owned by someone else, you have to pay a fee, but after that, you are allowed to buy it from him. This way, multinationals can be 'broken'; the player then selects a new country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The poorer countries are helped by the chance cards, which often award money to the poorer countries, while asking money from the richer countries. The richer countries are still better off, though...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
