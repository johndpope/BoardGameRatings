							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Resident Evil Skirmish</name>
									
			<description>A 2-player 8x8 skirmish game using miniatures and cards, based on the Resident Evil Franchise. One player is the Heroes. The other is the Umbrella Corporation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An 8x8 grid is used as the playing area, with figurines or chits representing units.&lt;br/&gt;Players select their units from a unique list.  Units have a set number of hit points and may have other characteristics.  For a typical game, each side should have about 20 hit points worth of units with units being placed on a player&amp;rsquo;s back 2 rows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck. Cards types are, Attack, Move, Defend, Special&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns with each turn comprising 3 phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Draw Phase&lt;br/&gt;          Draw 5 Cards. &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Action Phase&lt;br/&gt;          Play cards from your hand to have your units move and attack. Move and attack cards have an associated range value that determines the exact distance in spaces in which a unit moves or is hit by an attack from its source. Attacks do one hit point worth of damage unless otherwise stated. Units are eliminated when their hit point value is reduced to zero.&lt;br/&gt;         You opponent may play defence cards to negate attacks.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     End Phase&lt;br/&gt;         Max hand size is 5 cards. Discard excess cards. &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to completely eliminate all enemy units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
