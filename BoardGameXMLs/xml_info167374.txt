			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MURDER FOLLOWS WHEN SUPERSTITION CHALLENGES SCIENCE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Judy, the jungle-dwelling daughter of an American naturalist, confronts the lethal effects of out-of-control egoes when she crosses paths with a filmmaker and his crew, and struggles against sinister medicine men in the third and final entry in NUELOW Games' Judy of the Jungle series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to comics and fiction starring Judy, Judy of the Jungle: Murder Goes Native also contains two stories featuring Alani, one of the earliest ethnic comic book leads and one of the few &amp;quot;jungle girls&amp;quot; who wasn't white. Debuting in 1947, the same year Judy of the Jungle made her first appearance, the South Sea Girl series features some of artist Matt Baker's best work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the book contains a random story element generator for use when creating your own jungle action adventures for roleplaying games and elsewhere. It also has a special preview of Popcorn Press' forthcoming d6xd6 CORE Roleplaying Game, with Judy, Pistol Roberts, Alani, and other characters featured in the series adapted to the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
