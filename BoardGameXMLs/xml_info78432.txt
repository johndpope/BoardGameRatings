			<description>Hostages is a computer game developed by Infogrames in 1988. The game was called Hostage: Rescue Mission in the United States, and Operation Jupiter in France. The Nintendo Entertainment System port was called Rescue: The Embassy Mission. It was released for Acorn Electron, Archimedes, Atari ST, Amiga, Apple IIGS, Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, Commodore 64, DOS, MSX, NES and ZX Spectrum platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A terrorist group have overrun an embassy in Paris. The player takes control of six-men GIGN team on a mission is to free the hostages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is split into two or three (depending on platform) distinct sections:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* In the first part of the game, the player must bring three men into position so they can snipe the building. In doing so, the men must avoid the searchlight by hiding in doorways as well as rolling, crawling and running.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* The second part involves entering the building with the other three men. In some versions of the game, this section is linked to the first part. The player's men abseil down the side of the building to choose which room to enter from, and the snipers (positioned earlier) can be used to shoot the terrorists through the windows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* The building must then be searched, shooting the terrorists and finding the hostages in the process. In some versions of the game, hostages must be taken to a safe room. The first person block-by-block method of play is similar to some of Kemco's other games, including Shadowgate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sequel to the game, titled Alcatraz, was released by Infogrames in 1992 for Amiga, Atari ST and DOS platforms&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Hostages (video game), available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
