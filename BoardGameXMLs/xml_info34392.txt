			<description>Dr. Arnvie's[tm] Grand Rounds[tm] is a medical-themed trivia game produced by The Vincent Company, Inc. [Gledale, WI].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game follows the basic &amp;quot;Trivial Pursuit&amp;quot; approach to game play, every element is based on a medical theme. Even the rule sheet is presented as a &amp;quot;Prescription Form,&amp;quot; which notes Refill: PRN (As needed for fun).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Per the rules: &amp;quot;Each player acts as a resident physician. (A resident physician is a doctor who is undergoing specialty training following medical school.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, each player is given 10 patient cards [which] represent the patients that the player must try to discharge during the course of the game. One patient is discharged each time a question is answered correctly.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to discharge all his/her patients wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As per the Trivial Pursuit model, there are color-coded spaces on the board that correspond to question categories. The 4 categories are:&lt;br/&gt;Green-History and Personalities&lt;br/&gt;Yellow-General Medicine&lt;br/&gt;Red-Anatomy &amp;amp; Surgery; Public Health; Preventative Medicine&lt;br/&gt;Blue-Nutrition &amp;amp; Exercise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, other spaces offer exceptions to the color code system and present players with alternative Bonus and Risk cards that can modify their position on the board or choice of question categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules conclude with a directive [keeping with the prescription pad theme] for &amp;quot;NO GENERIC SUBSTITUTIONS&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Keep within reach of inquisitive teenagers &amp;amp; adults.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is followed with a fairly substantial disclaimer that though this game is based on reputable sources, one should turn to Dr. Arnvie for advice on medical treatment or conditions but should, instead, consult your regular medical provider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
