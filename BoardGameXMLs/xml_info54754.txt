							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Equilibrium</name>
									
			<description>In Equilibrium, each player takes control of a fledgling country and tries to bring balance to it's economic, political and military aspects.  Beyond the theme, Equilibrium is a novel card game in which each player will slowly deconstruct a deck of cards. To play cards into your play area, you have to remove other cards permanently from your deck.  Score cards played will reward players for the cards left in their deck.  However, each card left in their deck also scores -1 VP no matter what.  Players can decide to end their game on any turn... once they think their deck has reached &amp;quot;Equilibrium&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
