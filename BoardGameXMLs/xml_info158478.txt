			<description>(From the backcover, translated by User.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A lost prince,&lt;br/&gt;An insidious intrigue,&lt;br/&gt;A dark power, who is longing for revenge ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is turmoil in the normally peaceful sultanate of Daiwaristan, because the only son and heir of the old sultan is missing without a trace. Where could he be? Has he run away? Or is he the victim of a kidnapping? And what about the rumours of a secret liaison of the prince?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All these questions need to be answered, to finally find out, where the prince is: In the realms of the mummy-princes of Shan'Zasar. Therefore, somebody needs to follow the trail of the prince into the realm of the undead, where the gleaming sun is burning down on the barren soil at day, while the bony servants of the mummy-princes roam at night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But this is just the forerunner of the true horror, who lurk in the dark of the Pyramide of Death - because here, giant beetles, skelettons, undead priests and not least an evil, that had been banished centuries ago, seek out the character's lifes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Pyramide of Death&amp;quot; is a Dungeonslayers adventure for characters from 9th to 12th level. It plays in the sultanate Daiwaristan and the realm of the mummy-princes of Shan'Zasar in the south of the world Caera. Here, tales from 1001 night meet sinister undead, slaves give their lives to build monumental pyramide-fortresses and a deafening noise from the hagglers is echoing on the bazars. Daiwaristan, starting point of the adventure, is covered in detail and can therefore be used even after the events of this adventure as base and haven for adventures in the south of Caera.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
