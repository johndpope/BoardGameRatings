			<description>A co-operative medieval crime fighting game, it is a strong story driven co-operative experience, where you take on the role of watchmen trying to find and arrest criminals. When you sit down to play, you pick a case to attempt, some are for beginners while others challenge even the most experienced players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During your turn you must prioritise either gathering clues, following up leads or hunting out information. Working together is important, as there is limited time to find and arrest the guilty before they escape and you lose. After you&amp;rsquo;ve finished your turn, a story card is drawn. These cards change the game, moving the suspects, adding special rules and generally making the game tougher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
