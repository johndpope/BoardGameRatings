			<description>Jet Force Gemini is a 3D science fiction third-person shooter video game developed and published by RareWare exclusively for the Nintendo 64  on October 11, 1999. The single-player adventure spans many varied planets as the player assumes the role of Jet Force Gemini&amp;mdash;the last remaining group of the once proud and strong military organization, Jet Force. Jet Force Gemini is composed of three members, Juno, his sister Vela, and their cybernetic-enhanced dog Lupus. The main story arc encompasses the trio's quest as they try to stop the advances of the dark insect tyrant Mizar and his near limitless army. The game is unique in that it employs a cooperative style of gameplay, where two can play the story mode at once. Multiplayer modes can be unlocked, including the traditional death-match and survival matches. Also available in multiplayer are racing games, as well as the firing range mode, which is similar to a rail shooter game. Jet Force Gemini shares elements with platform games, first person shooters, and run and gun games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Jet Force Gemini&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
