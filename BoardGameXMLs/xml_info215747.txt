							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ancalia: The Broken Towers</name>
									
			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For five long years, the nine terrible Night Roads have vomited forth horrors from beyond this world. For five anguished winters the people of Ancalia have been tormented by plague, corpse-horrors and Uncreated abominations. Now only scattered enclaves of desperate survivors remain amid this once-beautiful land. The last heroes of the golden past are guttering out in blood and despair, the last hopes of the nation falling away one after the other. Even the valiant royal knights and fiercely pious prelates of the Unitary Church can only prolong the nation's death-agonies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet the monstrous powers of the Uncreated Courts did not reckon with the Godbound. Unforetold by these dark lords and unfettered by the limits of mere mortals, these new heroes of the age have the power to avert Ancalia's awful doom and the strength to forge a new destiny for a land long blasted by evil. They have the power to summon allies from among the fae Cousins, the scattered knights, and the hard-pressed survivors of Ancalia. They bear the Words that can shout down the terrible lords of the Uncreated Courts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But will their power carve a path to glorious victory, or will they fall prey to the shadows of this ninefold-cursed land?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
