			<description>Character Law, 1st Edition is an original Rolemaster core rulebook which is essentially a player's manual without detailed information about magic or weapons while the book Campaign Law is essentially a gamemaster's guide.  Topics include character creation, character classes, character races, character skills, and a price chart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: This book was later combined with Campaign Law as Character Law &amp;amp; Campaign Law along with some additional material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
