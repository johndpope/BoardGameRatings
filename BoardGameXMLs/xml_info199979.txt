			<description>Ozora is on the brink of war.  The Capulan City States, united for the first time in centuries, have assembled the largest airship fleet ever seen.  They rise like smoke over the continent.  &lt;br/&gt;To the west, the factories of the Uhrstadt Regime hum with energy.  The cogs of the great machine squeal and turn.  &lt;br/&gt;The chants of the mystics of Ovog can be heard like distant thunder rolling in from the north.  &lt;br/&gt;Vehenna, gleaming like a flower in full bloom, sows the seeds of discord to the south.  A bitter fruit has been planted.  &lt;br/&gt;And like the tide, the free-men of Amaranth lap at the eastern shores.  &lt;br/&gt;The balance of power is delicate, and the will of a few will decide the fate of the land&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;Take part in the duels of these heroes, the greatest fighters ever to live&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;Take part in the thrilling combat of &amp;ldquo;GUNSWORD.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GUNSWORD is a fast-paced, mix-and-match, tactical card game set in the world of Ozora.  Long ago, monstrous beasts called Titans roamed the land.  Duelists from all over the world trained and competed in the Wild Hunt, an annual event where hopeful fighters would pit their wits and their gunswords against these powerful creatures.  Now that the Titans are all but extinct, the denizens of Ozora have focused their skills on each other in dueling tournaments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, you pick a character from our roster of Duelists. Then, choose a Weapon for them to wield in battle. Every character has a favorite weapon, but these people are experts: they can fight with anything. With five characters and five weapons to mix and match in the Core Set, there are over 100 unique 2-player match-ups right out of the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Duelist and Weapon will determine the cards in your deck. You&amp;rsquo;ll end up with 30 cards representing your skills in combat. Then you just set out your characters in starting position, shuffle up, and fight!  Using two unique systems to represent the flow of combat, the Momentum resource and a modified Chess movement system, GUNSWORD is a game for all ages and experience-levels to enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
