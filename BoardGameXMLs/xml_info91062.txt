			<description>Cool Boarders is a snowboarding video game developed by UEP Systems for the PlayStation. It was released in Japan in August 1996, in North America in December 1996, and in Europe in January 1997. The game has since been re-released through Greatest Hits collections in both Japan and North America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of three main courses (plus two additional unlockables) in which the player attempts to gain the fastest time, most points from performing tricks, and also total points, a combination of the two previous disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This early game, while simple, lead the way for the development of much more popular, extreme sport games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cool Boarders&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
