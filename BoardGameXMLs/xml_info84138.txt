			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Once Hannibal had been defeated at Zama in 202 BC, Rome was clear to concentrate on securing and expanding its eastern frontier beyond the Adriatic. The resources required for the Second Punic War had previously forced the Romans to conclude a compromise with peace with Philip V of Macedon, but with the Carthaginian threat removed, it was payback time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The neutral states of Rhodes and Pergamum provided an excuse for war, appealing to Rome for aid against Macedonian aggression, and the legions marched  towards Greece. Philip blocked the passes onto the peninsula at Epirus, but a consul named Titus Quincticus Flaminius managed to get a small force around the Macedonian flank. Philip, convinced that the whole Roman army was about to descend upon him, pulled back into Thessaly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Romans consolidated their hold on Epirus and voted Flaminius in for another term as consul and therefore military leader. After some intense diplomacy to establish which of the less dominant, minor powers of the region were allied to whom, Flaminius and Philip met at Cynoscephalae, named from the Greek for 'dog's head' after the name of a nearby ridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subtitled The Battle of Cynoscephalae 197 BC, this is a scenario for the Vis Bellica miniature wargame system. Scenario includes orders of battle for both sides, features of the battlefield, historical information about the battle, army sheeets for all of the forces, initial deployment, and defeat condition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenario appears in Wargames Illustrated #187 (April 2003)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
