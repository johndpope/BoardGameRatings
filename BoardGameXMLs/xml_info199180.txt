							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Caviar: The Elegant Challenge</name>
									
			<description>Caviar is an abstract strategy game played on 8x8 grid with each of the corner spaces missing. This results in the first and last rows having only 6 spaces instead of the usual 8. Each player has 6 tiles numbered 1-6 which are placed on the first and last row in numbered order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, he rolls 6 dice to determine which pieces may move and by how many spaces. To begin with, pieces may only move sideways, forward, or forward diagonally, but may not move backwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a piece is adjacent to an opponent's piece, it can be jumped in a Checkers fashion and removed from the game. Once a piece reaches the opponent's starting row, it becomes a king and can now move backwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to eliminate all of his opponent's pieces from the game is the Winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
