			<description>Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toward the end of 1942, the German High Command saw that the tide was turning in the war. On the East Front, von Paulus was surrounded in Stalingrad. Rommel had been defeated at El Alamein in Egypt and, in October, was retreating with his battered army toward Tripoli. Now the Americans were making their presence felt by landing at various points in Morocco and Algeria, threatening the Axis position in Africa from the rear. The Germans rushed forces by air and sea to Tunisia to counter the threat. They arrived just in time, as the lead elements of the allied forces made their drive to capture Tunis by Christmas 1942. Then the tide turned with the weather, the roads turned to mud tracks and the Allied drive was stalled. Wedged between the on-coming Allied Armies of Algeria and Egypt, a scratch force of powerful Germans panzers, intermixed with available infantry replacement forces, regained the initiative through February, inflicting serious losses on green US forces facing battle against a determined enemy for the first time. But this was only to delay the inevitable loss of the Axis presence in Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenarios&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Panzer Campaigns: Tunisia '43 covers the three major offensives during the period from late November through May 1943:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-The Race to Tunis - Nov 25th to Dec 9th&lt;br/&gt;-The Germans Kasserine Offensive - Feb 14th to Feb 21st&lt;br/&gt;-The End in Africa - April 22nd to May 6th&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the Major Battles covered Chouigui, Sidi bou Zid, Kasserine, Operation Ochsenkopf, Flanking the Mareth Line and El Guettar to name a few.
