							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Agenda Game</name>
									
			<description>This undated but clearly recent political game focuses on control of issues rather than a contest for electoral votes. It is a very slick and highly accessorized package, with a game board, seven large Agenda with platform planks to be achieved, plastic stands for these cards, corresponding player tokens, seven decks of action cards (Propaganda, Smoke and Mirrors, &amp;quot;Dog Whistle&amp;quot;, Media, Scandal, Talking Points, and Politica), a deck of money cards, two decks of vote cards, plastic discs for each agenda, plastic bars with sliders to record % of public support for each agenda, a pen for marking the Agenda cars, a microfiber cloth for erasing markings, and an hourglass timer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each faction card has a seven-point agenda. The board includes three spaces called Agenda Buttons, and when a player lands on one of these, he may enact as many plank boxes on his platform as his resources permit at the time. The winner is the first to achieve an agreed number of platform planks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
