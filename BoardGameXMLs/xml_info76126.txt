			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Buddies&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Buddies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team Buddies is a game released for the PlayStation on September 18, 2000. It was published by Midway Games and developed by Psygnosis Camden Studio (now SCE Studio Soho).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a mix of Worms' goofiness and a typical real-time strategy game. Central to the game's theme is the ability of a team of buddies to stack crates in a 2x2x2 pad located in their starting area. Stacking the crates in different ways make different items when the resulting larger crate is broken; for example, a single crate on a stacking pad produces a light weapon, four crates positioned horizontally makes a heavy weapon, and filling the pad creates a vehicle. Up to three additional team members can also be created by stacking crates directly on top of each other; these new &amp;quot;buddies&amp;quot; can be commanded to attack or defend a certain area or even build on the stacking pad on their own. The player can swap between any of the buddies under his or her control in order to make use of that particular unit's powers or weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to a stacking pad, each starting point has a large base building which can be attacked and destroyed. If a base is destroyed, the stacking pad for that team can no longer be used; this means that new members cannot be created, making destroying the base a top priority for securing victory. A team without a base is also unable to build new weapons and must rely on those dropped by the enemy or found around the map (although a fast unit can steal a weapon from an enemy pad as it is being opened).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A typical map will have various &amp;quot;crate drop&amp;quot; areas (in most cases a small area at the players base and a much larger spawn in the middle of the map), where the crates used to build weapons and teammates fall from the sky. Most crates in the game are yellow with red borders, but yellow crates with blue borders also drop from time to time. Adding one of these to a crate formation causes the object or unit created by it to have increased abilities; for example, a higher rate of fire or range for a weapon or more hit points for a unit or vehicle. In certain maps, mega-crates also drop if certain conditions are met; these large, grey crates contain a weapon or vehicle not normally found in that particular area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team Buddies also supports split-screen multiplayer for up to four players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
