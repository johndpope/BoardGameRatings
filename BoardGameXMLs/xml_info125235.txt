							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sawmill</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A small creek has been tamed in this location to power a small sawmill. A sawmill used to process freshly cut trees from the nearby forests into beams and boards fit for construction. The mill itself is a rather simple affair, built from beams and boards itself. Even its roof is made of wooden shingles. A small waterwheel powers the vertical saws in its centre, the gears translating the wheels rotation into the saws vertical movement hidden&lt;br/&gt;below the mills floorboards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small ramps lead up into the building, both to feed the next log into the saw and to carry of the freshly cut boards. Unprocessed logs and freshly cut boards are both stacked neatly next to the mill, the former as they arrive and the later until they are carted off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
