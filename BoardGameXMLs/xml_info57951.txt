							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Laws and Disorder</name>
									
			<description>From The Game Crafter's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It was a time of great corruption, and also of great wealth for those who knew the secrets of the court and could turn it in their favor.  In Laws and Disorder, you play noblemen in a land ruled by ever-changing laws, and must bribe and bully the court into passing laws which benefit you, or harm your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has one of six different professions which grant them certain abilities.  The shrewd Trader may buy additional assets, while the cunning Thief can steal from other players.  The deck contains words which players combine into laws that everyone must obey.  The Trader might make a law stating The Theif loses 2 cards when they use an ability, which should put a stop to the Thief's meddling - for awhile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things get interesting when the Doctor, Priest and Banker manipulate existing laws, and when the Thief gives up his life of crime to swap professions with another player.  The result is a game which is never the same twice, and will keep you looking for new ways to turn the situation to your advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laws and Disorder is best played with 4-6 players and ample table space, although it makes for a longer and more strategic game with 2-3 players.  Package includes deck plus rules.  You must provide pocket change, play money or peanuts to use as game currency - I leave this choice up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Want to try before you buy?  You can also play Laws and Disorder in your browser on Whirled.com.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
