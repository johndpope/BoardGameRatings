							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wickedest of Them All</name>
									
			<description>In every city, there is one witch who's the most popular, most powerful and above all the most wicked. Wickedest of Them All pits 2-4 players against each other as they take on the roles of some of the most ruthless modern witches of all time, each one with one goal, to be the WICKEDEST OF THEM ALL!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose a witch and draw cards. Their goal is to see which character has the highest wicked rank by the end of the game. Each witch has special powers and three attributes. Magic, Wicked, and Status. Status is used to play minions and magic is used to cast spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actions: a Player can perform one action on their turn. They may summon a minion, use a character action, cast a spell, or have a minion attack. Playing equipment or minions do not count as actions and can be played at no &amp;quot;cost&amp;quot; during a turn.  A character can have up to 2 pieces of equipment in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spells&lt;br/&gt;Each spell has a number magic rank, in order for a witch to use a spell her magic rank must be equal to or higher than the spells magic rank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Status and minions&lt;br/&gt;A witch can call forth a minion in her player's hand if the witch has an equal or higher status than the minion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spells and minions as actions&lt;br/&gt;Can be cast to affect the game, cast on minions or victims or cast on other spells as actions. Minions have an attack rank and can damage other minions and victims doing damage to their target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gaining wicked: Some spells grant bonuses to wicked as do destroying victims and minions. All minions are worth one wicked and victims are worth an amount of wicked equal to their &amp;quot;goodness rank&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End Game.&lt;br/&gt;When the deck is depleted, the player whose character has the highest wicked wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
