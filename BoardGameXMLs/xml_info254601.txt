			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leon the Lion Heart is a Paladin and retired adventurer living in an Evil city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two nights ago his latest batch of magical throwing knives were stolen. His knives were sold to a team of pirate smugglers who are leaving tomorrow morning to another city to sell their stolen cargo. He wants to get onto the ship, grab his stuff quietly and get off as quickly as possible. For the quick and efficient search of the ship, he needs help. That's where the players come in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This intense mission style adventure features Pirates, Sewers, Wizards, Tattoo Parlors and insane Conjurers! Playing it makes you kind of feel like you're in the movie The Goonies. It's a great first tier adventure as it features a strong NPC adventurer who is there to back the players up and show new players the ropes of adventuring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a heavily revised version of The Lion and the Blades (3e).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
