			<description>Almost 1,000 years after the start of the Age of Dofus, new heroes are emerging to bring hope to a world in ruins. Everything must be rebuilt, and whether you're a fighter or a politician, a merchant or an artisan, in WAKFU, everything depends on you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dive headlong into a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (er, an MMORPG, if you prefer) in an original world which puts the LOL in tactical combat (what do you mean, you don't see it?).&lt;br/&gt;Strategy...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Iops, the thick-skulled but sturdy warriors, to Cras, the elite archer class, and from bomb-loving Rogues to psychotic Masqueraiders, you're sure to find your perfect character with 14 original classes to choose from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, alone or as part of a group, you'll have to arm yourself with courage and foolproof strategies to defeat the shadiest monsters in the World of Twelve, in turn-based battle!&lt;br/&gt;...Politics...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose your Nation and wear its colors proudly! Once you've become a citizen, you can vote in the elections and become a Guard or a Soldier for your Nation. Whatever you feel like doing, you have the chance to become an important political figure in the world of WAKFU!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps you'll make it to the top and fill the role of Governor&amp;hellip; or perhaps you'll end up in prison. In fact, there's no reason you can't do both...&lt;br/&gt;...and Ecology...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the first time in an MMORPG, the flora and fauna in the game form a real, living ecosystem managed by the players: you are free to protect it or to exploit its natural species to the point of extinction!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's up to you to control the monster population, the variety of plant life and even the climate. You decide the future of your ecosystem!&lt;br/&gt;...place you at the heart of a colorful transmedia universe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover or rediscover the World of Twelve's best-known places and characters, including Astrub, Amakna, Bonta, the Miss Uglies and the famous Black Crow!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
