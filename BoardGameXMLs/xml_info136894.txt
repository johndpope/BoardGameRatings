							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Microsoft Flight Simulator 5.1</name>
									
			<description>Flight Simulator 5 (FS5), released in 1993, was the last DOS-only release in the popular Microsoft Flight Simulator series which began in 1982.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FS5 marked a significant change in that it was the first version of the series to use textures. While this allowed FS5 to achieve a much higher degree of realism than the previous flat-shaded simulators, it also resulted in all add-on scenery and aircraft for the previous versions obsolete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other noticeable improvements included the use of digital audio for sound effects, custom cockpits for each aircraft (previous versions had a generic cockpit that was slightly modified to fit various aircraft), and overall improved graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1995, Flight Simulator 5.1 was introduced. It was the first version of the series to be released on CD-ROM. Changes included the ability to handle scenery libraries (including wide use of satellite imagery), faster performance and a barrage of true-to-life weather effects: storms, 3D clouds and fog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fans of the program generated a huge amount of custom &amp;quot;freeware&amp;quot; was created for FS5.1. Utility programs from Microsoft and third-parties allowed new aircraft, cockpits and airports to be created and added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;History of Microsoft Flight Simulator&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
