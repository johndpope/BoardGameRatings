							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monsters Inc. Scream Catcher</name>
									
			<description>This is an electronic reaction game with a &amp;quot;Monsters Inc.&amp;quot; theme. Players choose a colored Scream Canister and sit directly behind it. On top of the game is a door with Mike and Sulley standing next to it. As play begins, the top will whirl and as the door opens, a scream, laugh, or voice will be heard. You need to hit the Scream Canister in front of you to &amp;quot;capture&amp;quot; a scream (for 1 point) or a laugh (for 2 points). The player who presses the canister first gets the point(s). If Mike's voice is heard, a player pressing a canister loses a point. The first player to score 10 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
