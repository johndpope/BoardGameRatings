			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reap the Wages of Sin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Envy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth, and wrath. The temptation and allure of the seven deadly sins is undeniable. They have fascinated and tantalized audiences for centuries, and the idea of the seven deadly sins appears frequently in movies, books, games, and other media. They even have a role at the very heart of the Pathfinder Campaign Setting, and feature centrally in its most iconic Adventure Path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book envisions each of the seven deadly sins as a corruption, using the rules from Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Horror Adventures, allowing players to indulge themselves in these vices and gain rewards (and drawbacks) for doing so. Each corruption&amp;rsquo;s manifestations subtly encourage the character to act in ways fitting to the sin, forcing players to make difficult choices as they balance the power of their corruption against the dark deeds they must do to gain it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
