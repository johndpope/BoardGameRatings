			<description>Free download / print and play game. From the description at the download page of the POEE UK Resource Center (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://elstiko.googlepages.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://elstiko.googlepages.com/&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kallisti is a fnord game. Board games usually have four sides. Board games are usually flat. Board games usually cost money and aren't downloaded and assembled by your own hands. Kallisti beta testing has been abandoned in favor of PUBLIC RELEASE. Kallisti is now yours and you may test, amend and bastardize to suit yourselves. Enjoy! Or don't! It's up to you! Kallisti is a game for 2, 3 or 5 players Ages 5 and up. It is freely distributed (KopyLeft) All Rites Reversed. Reprint what you like. We hope ERIS would approve. The fnord has 5 sides, each side has 5 parts, there are 5 characters, you use a pentagonal spinner for movement, there are 5 suits of cards with 23 cards in each suit. Over the five parts of your part of the board you traverse 23 spaces. The first player to the 23rd space wins. Kallisti is brought to you by eL_sTiKo of the Cuckoo Trail Cabal, East Sussex, Saturn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
