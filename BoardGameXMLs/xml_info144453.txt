			<description>Fantail Faustball is another board game of the Fantail sportys games line. It is an educational, entertaining board game, where two teams play Faustballby using smart charts each.&lt;br/&gt; Faustball is played on a large field. The net is located at a certain height from the floor. Players must hit the ball with the fist; it is allowed to let the ball bounce on the floor one time before hiting it. Up to three passes are allowed before the ball is returned to the opposite field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the game board there is only a piece (the ball) which is moved by each team in turn, which makes the gameplay very agile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
