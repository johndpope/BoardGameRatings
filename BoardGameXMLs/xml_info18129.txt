							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sports Illustrated Handicap Golf Game</name>
									
			<description>This game provides you with the opportunity of playing 18 of the greatest holes in America using your own personal handicap to reflect how you might actually play these holes. Each game includes 5 playing boards, an exclusively designed Distance and Direction Finder, 8 ply action handicap folders, 4 golf &amp;quot;balls&amp;quot;. I believe that the holes are identical to the 18 holes used in a different SI golf game called &amp;quot;Go for the Green&amp;quot; which was produced by Avalon Hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
