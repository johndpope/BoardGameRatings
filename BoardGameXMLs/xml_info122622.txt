			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time Claw is an unofficial adaption of the Ironclaw RPG mechanics for use for time travel adventures in the multi-verse of the BBC&amp;rsquo;s Doctor Who series of television shows, books, movies and audio recordings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In it you play a character who has been swept up from your proper place in time and space and cast adrift aboard a TARDIS (Time and Relative Dimensions In Space) a vehicle which allows movement thru the temporal vortex which touches each and every location in the universe and every point in time at each of these points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are unfamiliar with the Dr. Who series don&amp;rsquo;t worry too much about, most travelers in the game begin with no real knowledge or understanding of the nature of greater reality. Concentrate instead on your character and the rest will eventually fall into place. Game Managers (Game Host in Ironclaw terminology) will need a copy of the basic Ironclaw RPG book (published by Sanguine Productions Ltd., ISBN 0-97045583-0-4) to work with beyond the information contained in this booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
