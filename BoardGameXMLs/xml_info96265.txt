			<description>From their own description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECT OF THE GAME: The object of the game is to build high scoring number sequences cross-cube fashion with as many cubes as possible before the timer runs out. The player who exercises the greatest skill and strategy in forming and locating number combinations on the playing board to best advantage will attain the highest score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the &amp;quot;Original Version&amp;quot;-(until such time yet another is discovered to refute such), that later kinds were based upon. It includes 15 six-sided dice with six-(6) varying numerals configurations upon those, to include some combination derived from the numbers between 1 to 15 upon their facile sides. There is also a &amp;quot;Sandtimer&amp;quot; attachment piece, to affix it onto a corner of the plastic GAME board/dice tray. Their &amp;quot;playing area&amp;quot; is comprised of an inset, plastic 9 X 9 grid in a &amp;quot;Scrabble-ish&amp;quot; demeanor, with *Special* placement spots denoting Double or Triple *Score*, as well with numbered sort from #4 to #15 arranged sequentially into an arrayed 'diamond pattern' 2-spots away from the center, as the middle one is their black START spot. The instructions are contained within their 'box-top', to include ample displays of numbers arrangements examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
