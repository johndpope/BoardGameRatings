			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In a galaxy filled with literally millions of inhabited planets, few spacecraft stand out as exceptional. There are hundreds of competing designs for even the most specialized craft. What makes a particular design successful is often not its merits, but guile and sheer luck. Such is the case with Trans-Tech's Civilian Passenger Transport, the CPT-12 Monarch.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first in our new Ships of the Galaxy series of spacecraft deck plans, The Monarch-class courier is the perfect addition to any science fiction campaign.  A spacious and comfortable private ship, the Monarch is just the thing for a group of PCs set to explore the galaxy who don't want to settle for yet another light freighter and can't afford a yacht.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 16 page PDF includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Two full page maps that are detailed enough to be blown up to poster size,&lt;br/&gt;    A detailed of history of the Monarch-courier that can be dropped into any science fiction game,&lt;br/&gt;    A complete description of the ship's major compartments and features,&lt;br/&gt;    Advice for GMs on how to add the Monarch-Courier to an existing campaign,&lt;br/&gt;    Ready made Adventure Seeds,&lt;br/&gt;    Game statistics for the white Star rules system&lt;br/&gt;    And four pages of full-size battle maps!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weather you want to travel to a galaxy far, far away or out on the final frontier, the Monarch-Courier is just what you need to head for the stars!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
