			<description>Object of the game: Keep possession of Play-cards by remembering exactly were the 12 images are hidden. 12 different images are hidden under blue 'caps' During the game they move from one place to another. The oldest player starts this game. Throw the dice en move your pon over the track on the board. Execute the command which is stated by an pictogram. You either have to point out the right and exact location of the number or image that is stated on the track. The tricky thing is that the caps move around the board as a result of some orders. Some orders on the track are simple, and need you to pin point 1 image or number. Other orders force yoy to point out for example, 3 fruits or 3 figures. Every player has 3-7 playcards. everytime they slip out during the game by not pointing out the right items, they loose one playcard (it is flipped to the stop-side). The player who keeps at least one card in play while the others are played out, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
