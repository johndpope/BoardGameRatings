			<description>From the &amp;quot;design concept&amp;quot; section of the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Design Specification for Final Score demanded a quick-playing game (15 to 20 minutes per match), accurate results (of course), an exciting and smooth-flowing play system and the feeling that individual players were just as important as the overall team performance in arriving at the result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;For speed of play the game has to be a 'highlights' system.  We decided on a deck of Fast Action Cards to provide the smooth flow, and we rejected a playing pitch [board] as being unnecessary.  The basis of the system is the re-creation of the potentially decisive duels, between individual players, team strengths and tactics, that punctuate every soccer match.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes team and player cards for sixteen prominent postwar English league teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
