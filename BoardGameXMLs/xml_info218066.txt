			<description>You're the Pirate Captain, and you live or die by your Ship. Your field is the deck of your Ship. Your opponents' fields are theirs.  Each player draws cards to form a hand consisting of crew, cannons, field effects, and outside influences, and attempt to use the cannons to sink the other ships.  Crew can fire the cannons, shoot pistols at opposing crew, repair the ship, and bandage wounds.  Using each crewmembers special skills and talents, you have to keep your ship afloat while doing your best to send everyone else to the bottom of the sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
