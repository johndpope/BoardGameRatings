			<description>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a popular Japanese comic created by Hirohiko Araki. It is first published in 1987 in Japan. In March 2007, Bandai Carddas release a CCG about this story. The first series features around 100 cards which contains characters from part 1 to part 3 of the original story. One of the main features of this CCG is that the card arts are all from Araki's original arts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be 5 different type of cards: Hero card, Character card, Stand card, Event card and Stage card. The first set starter contains 32 random inserted cards (there will be a random selection of 47 common cards, 6 uncommon cards and 3 starter only cards). Rare cards are only available from booster packs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
