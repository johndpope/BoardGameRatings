			<description>1KM1KT summary:&lt;br/&gt;Travel the venomous swamps of the Mud Planet. Link your mind with the mind of the savage beast, master the Dragon and become a Lancer, sworn to protect your people in these times of chaos. But beware: The bond is not a one way street, and the Dragon&amp;rsquo;s instincts and urges are of violent power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scundea, the Mud Planet, is a foul place. Treacherous swamps and pools of rotting water stretch far and wide under a sick yellowish sun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dragons that roam the overcast skies are hideous creatures of terrible might and cruel cunning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But those few Gifted who dare touch the predator?s mind, those chosen champions that dare mount and master the Dragon, are bearers of hope to a people abandoned by civilization long ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lancers, as they are called, must not falter in their discipline and devotion, for the Dragon?s urges and instincts are of violent power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those who fail become beasts themselves, Savages that dwell in the wild and have forgotten all about virtue and reason.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet in the linking of souls, the stirring of the beast inside the man, lies great power and terrible temptation to behold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you handle the mind of a Dragon?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
