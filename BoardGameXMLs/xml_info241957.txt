							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Starship Duel</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A two-player space game filled with action, graphics and sound.  Each player starts with a fleet of starships and must destroy the opponent's fleet one-by-one.  Sound easy?  Not only can both ships fly around the screen, but when stopped they disappear.  And if you run out of fuel during flight, your ship will explode!  Four levels of difficulty will keep you occupied for many an exciting hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By John Kanopa&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
