			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Petit Annibal was originally a British ship, the HMS Hannibal, built by Adams of Bucklers Hard and launched on 26 December 1779. She was subsequently captured by the French ship H&amp;eacute;ros off the coast of Sumatra, in 1782. She was called Petit Annibal to distinguish her from the eponymous 74&amp;ndash;gun Annibal, which was in the same fleet. Admiral Bailli de Suffren took her into his fleet, and she saw service in his five battles against British Admiral Sir Edward Hughes in 1782 and 1783. She was decommissioned in 1787 and used as a hulk from 1792.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ship pack can also be used to represent the French Portland Class &amp;ldquo;Leander 1798.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ship pack contains a new ship with base, ship card, ship log, and specific deck of maneuver cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
