			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sequel to Thrust. The gameplay is similar, the player controlling a spaceship tasked with picking up items and delivering them while avoiding enemies and taking into account the effects of gravity. The game manual says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The war against the Galactic Empire continues.&lt;br/&gt;The Federal Resistance force has captured a small artificially created planet, designated simply P2112. This planet is an essential forward base for the next offensive against the Empire. Planet 2112 has not yet been atmospherically completed and is covered in a cloud of red dust which blocks out sunlight and prevents the existence of life on the surface. The Resistance needs to complete the purification of the atmosphere to make Planet 2112 an effective base.&lt;br/&gt;Deposited undeground are orbs of varying masses that need to be brought to the surface and put in place to construct the atmospheric processor. The orbs, once separated from their holder, become unstable and will explode within a certain time period unless correctly deposited.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
