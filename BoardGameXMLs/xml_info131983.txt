							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City of Steam</name>
									
			<description>City of Steam is a full-featured, browser-based 3D MMORPG that transports players to Nexus, an industrial metropolis that has fallen from grace. Emerging from the ashes of ages past, heroes versed in swordplay, divine harmonies, and the arcane arts seek their fortune in a world beset by countless foes, from dangerous factions to mechanical horrors. This is a world where wondrous feats of industry and technology are front and center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By and large we label the game as &amp;ldquo;industrial age fantasy&amp;rdquo;; although it does have a good helping of steampunk elements, the fantasy aspects of our lore bring it away from what could be considered &amp;ldquo;pure steampunk&amp;rdquo;. Still, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean this is just some run-of-the-mill fantasy world with a few guns and bots thrown in, oh no! You won&amp;rsquo;t find horses or dragons. People use steambikes and airships. The entire world itself is a mechanism of gears and spokes, with lost technology as ancient as the world itself just waiting to be discovered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website. &lt;br/&gt; City of Steam was released in May 2013. In November 2013, the English version will be relaunched on new servers as City of Steam: Arcadia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
