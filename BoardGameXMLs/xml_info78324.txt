							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Block Cascade Fusion</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher Website&lt;br/&gt;Block Cascade is a very addictive puzzle game which lets you enter compelling worlds full of different falling blocks. The goal is to create a line of at least five similary colored blocks by rotating and arranging the falling squares properly. Once the timer stops, the fusion will start and erase linked blocks. The basic concept is simple, but there's a fair amount of depth to the game, especially if you're aiming for a high score. Points are awarded according to the size and number of blocks that are cleared from the screen. Great visuals glow and respond to your actions! Perform combos to score high enough, and you're in for a treat!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
