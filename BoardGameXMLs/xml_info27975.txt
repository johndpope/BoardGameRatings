			<description>De Verbis is a promotional word-formation game from Linguam&amp;oacute;n - House of languages and it can be played in various languages. From the rules booklet:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;quot;Only one thing is more fun than guessing words: getting others to do it. In DE VERBIS, players take turns at thinking up and guessing words. The player who does it best wins the round.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     45 letter cards&lt;br/&gt;     10 &amp;quot;?&amp;quot; cards&lt;br/&gt;     30 counters&lt;br/&gt;     A pen and paper are needed for keeping score&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary of rules:&lt;br/&gt;In each round one of the players thinks a 8-10 letter word and marks it with the &amp;quot;?&amp;quot; cards on the table and keeps the deck of letter cards. The other players are given some tokens and, in turn, they ask for a letter: if it is included in the word, the player with the deck of cards places that letter in its correct position on top of the corresponding &amp;quot;?&amp;quot; card; if the letter is not in the word, the player who asked for it must pay 1 token. Whenever a player guesses the word correctly he receives 2 tokens plus as many tokens as &amp;quot;?&amp;quot; cards are still in the word; but if the guessed word is wrong, the player must pay 2 tokens. The player who thought the word receives as many tokens as the difference between the top scorer and the least scorer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the philosophy of the publisher the rules are in Catalan, Spanish, English, French, Basque, Galician, Occitan and Italian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;The publisher, Linguam&amp;oacute;n &amp;ndash; House of Languages, is a body set up by the Government of Catalonia with the aim of promoting the world's languages as a:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     vehicle for communication, civilization and dialog &lt;br/&gt;     source of personal development, human creativity and heritage of mankind &lt;br/&gt;     right of individuals and of linguistic communities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
