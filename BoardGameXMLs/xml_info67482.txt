							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Go Goal! Ole! Tournament</name>
									
			<description>In Go Goal! Ole! Tournament each player contols a team of five footballers.  On their turn each players can spend up to one action for each footballer they control, not including the goalkeeper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That action may be to move the footballer 1 space in any direction, to tackle another player, to pass the ball to another footballer or empty space, play an SFC (Special Function Card) or shoot for goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To tackle, each player rolls a D12.  If the attacker wins, the two footballers exchange places and the attacker gains possession of the ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To pass the ball to another player or space, you just need to have line of sight to the space you're aiming for and it needs to be in a straight line (like the queen's movement in chess).  You then simply place the ball on that player or space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player recieves 3 Special Funcion Cards in each half of the game which can be played at any point during your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To shoot at goal, each footballer figure has a spring-loaded knee joint which you pull back and release.  This is where the dexterity aspect of the game comes in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 90 of these super-quick turns in a standard game, and whoever has scored the most goals by the end is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the description on the box:&lt;br/&gt;Go Goal! Ole! Tournament is a five-a-side football board game, combining the technique of shooting a ball and strategic thinking of a board game that gives players to enjoy and feel the excitement of a real football match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;1x Football Field&lt;br/&gt;4x Footballs&lt;br/&gt;8x Footballer Figures with Stands&lt;br/&gt;2x Goalkeeper Figures with Stands&lt;br/&gt;2x Goal Posts with 4x Goal Screws&lt;br/&gt;1x Score and Round Counter&lt;br/&gt;25x Special Function Cards&lt;br/&gt;4x Promotion Stands&lt;br/&gt;1x Coin&lt;br/&gt;2x 12-sided Dice&lt;br/&gt;4x Stoppage Cones&lt;br/&gt;1x VCD/DVD Game Demo&lt;br/&gt;1x Full-Colour Manual (in English)&lt;br/&gt;4x Black &amp;amp; White Manuals (Danmark, Norge, Suomi &amp;amp; Sverige)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The official website is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.gogoalole.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.gogoalole.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
