							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Palace of Mental Hygiene</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Officially, the Palace of Mental Hygiene represents the government&amp;rsquo;s dedication to the welfare of its citizens. Officially, it is a place dedicated to helping the mentally ill and the socially maladjusted heal and become happy, contributing members of society. Officially, no one is sent there who does not need help. However, now you know the truth. You know that you are not mentally ill. You know that your only social maladjustment was daring to question the government&amp;rsquo;s will. You know these things now. The only question is, how long will you be able to remember them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
