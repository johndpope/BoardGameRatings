			<description>&amp;quot;Infantry Combat: The Rifle Platoon&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;an interactive exercise in small-unit tactics and leadership&amp;quot; written by John F. Antal, the commanding officer of a tank battalion in Korea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A pair of six-sided dice are required to play this solitaire game which is a variation on the Choose Your Own Adventure game book genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Infantry Combat, you take on the role of a U.S. Army second lieutenant. &amp;quot;Your light infantry battalion has been airlifted into the Middle East on short notice, and now your platoon must defend Wadi Al Sirree against the superior might of an advancing enemy mechanized force . . . The scenario is highly realistic and is supported by maps and appendices with detailed specifications of the equipment and forces involved.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;John Antal wrote three books which used this system: Armor Attacks, Infantry Combat, and Combat Team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
