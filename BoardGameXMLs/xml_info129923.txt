							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Invasion of Jericho Bay</name>
									
			<description>[Taken from the Introduction.]&lt;br/&gt;In 1942, the Japanese launched an ineffective attack against the Aleutian Islands off Alaska in the hopes of drawing American forces from the conflict in the Pacific. This poorly planned and executed invasion did not last. Time, weather, lack of supplies and an American counter-invasion all spelled doom for the operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many believe this was the only physical invasion of the United States by the Imperial forces of the Japanese Empire. They are wrong. In 1945, during the hectic battle for supremacy on Okinawa, a portion of forces from both sides of the conflict were ripped 7,420 miles by the power of a dying American Talent and dropped on an isolated island off the coast of Maine. There another, secret battle was waged in the small fishing town of Jericho Bay between a small force of Japanese irregulars, the remnants of a squad of the 6th Marines and the townsfolk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this scenario, the players take the role of Talents (Army, Navy or Marine) pulled from the cauldron of battle in Okinawa and sent through the mysterious Bubble which has engulfed a portion of the island, halting the progress of the invasion forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the other side they find that war, especially war on your own home soil, is always less easily fought than one might imagine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
