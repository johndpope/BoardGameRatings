							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lidaem</name>
									
			<description>From Overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subtle touch of their political guidance is all but undetectable in desert cities. They mix freely with the social elite, the true extent of their influence going undetected by their peers. The exotic lidaem are both dependent on and separate from other desert cultures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lidaem are a race of female humanoids that become ingrained fixtures of desert cultures. An obvious comparison of the lidaem is made with amazons. Beyond the fact that both groups are composed entirely of females, there is little similarity between the two. Amazons are sub-races of other races. The lidaem are a proper race. Lidaem require males from other humanoid races to propagate the species, but always produce pureblooded lidaem. Lidaem shy away from the physical pursuits preferred by amazons, preferring to develop their psionic and social skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet, like amazons, lidaem possess a distinct culture. The home of the lidaem, Acobil, exists on a plane separate from the cultures they adopt. Acobil and the lidaem race are the priorities of the race, not allegiances to adopted cultures. Lidaem closely guard the secrets of their culture and Acobil. This hidden culture is maintained in small covens of traveling lidaem. Wherever one lidaem treads, so to does their culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
