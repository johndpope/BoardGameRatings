			<description>Technology&lt;br/&gt;Brink's engine is based on id Tech 4 with a new rendering framework and improved support for multiple CPU cores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Brink is a first-person shooter which features the SMART (Smooth Movement Across Random Terrain) Freerunning System. In a similar manner to Mirror&amp;rsquo;s Edge, SMART lets players maneuver around environments in dynamic and unique ways all based on player position and immediate need. It has a story mode which can be played cooperatively online in missions with up to 8 players. Players can create custom characters with additional rewards bought with experience points. When joining a game, the player replaces an AI fighter. Players are offered objectives that will award them with experience points if completed. When one player selects a particularly important objective, other team members are offered complementary objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;Brink is an immersive first-person shooter that blends single-player, co-op, and multiplayer gameplay into one seamless experience, allowing you to develop your character whether playing alone, with your friends, or against others online. You decide the combat role you want to assume in the world of Brink as you fight to save yourself and mankind's last refuge. Brink offers a compelling mix of dynamic battlefields, extensive customization options, and an innovative control system that will keep you coming back for more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not Just Another Hero&lt;br/&gt;Brink's advanced player customization offers a near-endless combination of looks for your character - allowing for the appearance of your character to be truly unique. As you progress through the game and acquire more experience, you'll have even more opportunities for customization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two Sides to Every Story&lt;br/&gt;Choose to fight through two complete story campaigns as either a member of the Resistance or Security. Experience these campaigns solo, co-operatively, or competively - it's your choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blurring the Lines&lt;br/&gt;Take your unique character online at any time you choose. Brink allows you to seamlessly move between single player, co-op with friends, and intense multiplayer action. Multiplayer takes the story online where you can play with up to seven other people (or AI characters) cooperatively as you take on the opposing faction or with up to 16 players competitively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing S.M.A.R.T.&lt;br/&gt;Brink uses the familiar shooter controls that you're used to and adds a new feature: the SMART button. When you hold down the SMART button, the game dynamically evaluates where you're trying to get to, and makes it happen. Whether you're a seasoned FPS veteran or someone just getting started, you'll be able to make more intelligent decisions during the fast-paced action with SMART.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Context-Sensitive Goals and Rewards&lt;br/&gt;Objectives, communications, missions, and inventory selection are all dynamically generated based on your role, your condition, your location, your squad-mates, and the overall status of the battle in all gameplay modes. You'll always know exactly where to go, what to do when you get there, and what your reward will be for success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At QuakeCon 2010, Splash Damage announced Brink's digital pre-order bonuses for several digital retailers (GameStop, Best Buy, Amazon.com, Direct2Drive, Walmart, and Steam) in North America. These bonuses will expand the players customization, with DOOM, Fallout, Psycho and Spec Ops packs.&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://brink.wikia.com/wiki/Brink,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://brink.wikia.com/wiki/Brink,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
