			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Space Station 10 map is a section of an orbital Space Station having a variable diameter - up to 1740 feet (about 530 meters). Use one or two maps for a quick battle, or splice together several sections to build a fully operational station! Mix and match sections to form your own style of space station. A starting space station (with most of the ring under construction) can be as small as three sections: Command, Docking Bay, and Quarters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each section book also includes two bonus sections - one construction tunnel link, and a blank section you can use as you like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Design: Space Station 10 is ring-shaped to accomodate it's modular sections. Its shape provides some defensive cover for smaller ships docked inside the ring. In hostile areas, it is best to have a Security &amp;amp; Defense section next to Docking Bays and Command sections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scale: Each map is 20 x 12 squares 5 feet across. Scaled at about 1 to 0.75 inches per 5 feet (varying slightly due to the arc shape of a section) which fits a section onto two 8.5 x 11 inch pages. It should be adaptable to most battle systems featuring a scale of 1 inch per 5 feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other Details: Many systems in a section may not be visible on the maps, since they would be installed above the ceiling or below the flooring. These systems include the obvious things like plumbing, electrical, and ventilation, but also common things already on some maps, like emergency escape pods and crew quarters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
