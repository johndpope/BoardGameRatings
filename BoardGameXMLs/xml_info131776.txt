			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have fun playing the classics!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play and learn from four of the greatest game programs of all time -In their original, uncut, officially endorsed versions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore the deep and twisted recesses of Colossal Cave. Experience the thrills and danger of gathering treasure while using your wits to outmaneuver the peril that lurks around very corner. Here is the only version of Adventure officially endorsed by its creators, Will Crowther and Don Woods. This is the first, the original, the complete Adventure. This is the one that started it all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Playing adventure games without tackling this one is like being an English major who's never glanced at Shakespeare&amp;quot;... Whole Earth Software Catalog&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eliza&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1965, M.I.T. Professor Joseph Weizenbaum astounded the scientific community by creating the pioneering Artificial Intelligence program, ELIZA. Eliza simulates with uncanny reality, your conversation with a psychiatrist. Hailed as a breakthrough in computer science, Eliza provided a model for generations of Artificial Intelligence research in the years to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a faithful recreation of The Original Artificial Intelligence Classic--Eliza, in the version that has been described as, &amp;quot;Standing head and shoulders above previous attempts to bring the original mainframe program to the microcomputer.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;There is a fantastic computer game called Life. It is played by collegiate computer hackers, by film makers experimenting with animation, and sundry others. Life was devised in 1970 by John Horton Conway, a young mathematician at the University of Cambridge and introduced to the world by Martin Gardner in the pages of Scientific American. Described as both a game and a video art form, Life has had a cult following ever since.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it's more than that, The Life screen is a world unto itself. It has its own objects, phenomena, and physical laws. It is a window onto an alternate universe.&amp;quot;... Wm. Poundstone &amp;quot;The Recursive Universe&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The deepest of all computers games&amp;quot;... Whole Earth Software Catalog&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;People with home computers who wonder what to do with them might try their hand at Life. It is a game unlike any other.&amp;quot;... The Los Angeles Times&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pong&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1972, Electronics Engineer Al Alcorn created the video game &amp;quot;Pong&amp;quot; for Nolan Bushnell's fledgling company, &amp;quot;Atari&amp;quot;. He changed, forever, the way world plays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this edition of &amp;quot;Golden Oldies&amp;quot;, Al has recreated for us, his original classic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experience once again, the game that burst out of Andy Capps's Bar in Sunnyvale, California and became a national craze. (We have included an alternate version with some added wrinkles that takes full advantage of your modern microcomputer's capabilities.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
