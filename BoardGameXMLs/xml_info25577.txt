			<description>Taken from the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EO is a complete naval, ground and air system simulating what might have happened had the invasion of Oahu been carried out immediately after the Pearl harbor raid. The game uses a double blind system for the naval aspects, as the US/Japanese carriers attempt to locate one another and destroy them. Each player is put in their historical counterpart's position just after the PH raid. The game uses two maps, a tactical map showing the island of Oahu for the ground battle, and a operational map for the naval and air operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire rules included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game includes:&lt;br/&gt;280 counters&lt;br/&gt;1 Operational map&lt;br/&gt;1 Tactical map&lt;br/&gt;Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
