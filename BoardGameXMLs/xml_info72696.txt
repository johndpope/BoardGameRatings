			<description>[From the publisher's website]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using their finger, players trace over an LED maze in an attempt to escape the maze within the time limit. If the player is successful they win either tickets or the prize of their choice depending on game model. Failure in completing the maze earns the player tickets based on the option, minimum tickets or maximum tickets, that the operator selects (Redemption or Hybrid models).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since game-play is time based, it is intense, yet short. The player turnover is quick, but unlike similar quick games, there is real skill involved in the fun factor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
