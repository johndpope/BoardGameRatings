			<description>Use up all your cards to win in an epic battle between Captain America and Loki.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 4 types of cards: Captain America cards and Loki cards are numbered 1-5, there are also switch cards and wild cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt 5 cards and the first player selects a card to play, then players take turns playing 1 card. If a Captain America card was played previously, the next card played must be a Captain America card with a higher number. If a Loki card was played previously a Loki card with a lower number must be played. You can play a Loki card on a Captain America or vice versa if the numbers on both are the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wild card can be played at any time. When a wild card is played that player plays a second card of their choice. The switch card can also be played at any time. This card changes play from Loki or Captain America to the opposite character. The next player may then play any value of the new character card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player cannot play a card they draw a card. If the drawn card is playable it can be played otherwise it goes in the player's hand. The first player to play all their cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
