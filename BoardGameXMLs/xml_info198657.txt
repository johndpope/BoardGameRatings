							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ghost Ship Enyo</name>
									
			<description>Author's Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six months ago, another ship controlled by Command found a enormous hundred-year-old shipwreck floating there. They reported the findings back to Command, and left the shipwreck untouched. The ship is called the Enyo, and it was long thought to have been completely destroyed in the final battle of the Similean War. Now, you are a lab tech on the spaceship, Innovation, coming to explore the Enyo. You have been instructed by command to take a crew of scientists to pilot-test a new machine designed to purify air and stabilize the environments of spaceships where the hull has been fatally breached. Rather than test this machine by crashing service ships into things, the tests of this machine are taking place on shipwrecks throughout the galaxy. This is the first time the machine, the Magnapur42, will be tested in a non-simulated shipwreck environment. The wreck has been deemed safe, and you and some other team-members have come aboard. This is an out-loud text-adventure game, created in the tradition of the ones that people used to play on their computers. This is an adaptation of this genre, designed and tested for use with a group of people instead of a computer. Content warnings for this game include: violence, mental illness, suicide, family separation, and fictional religiosity. Recommended for ages 16+.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
