			<description>Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DUNGEON MASTERS ASSISTANT, Volume II: CHARACTERS &amp;amp; TREASURES is SSI's latest time saver for Dungeon Masters (DMs).  No longer is it necessary to spend hours populating a town or generating player characters or henchmen.  Speed up your game immeasurably by generating detailed player or non-player characters, and large treasure hoards, in moments!  Every facet of character generation, from languages and spell lists to class and racial abilities, is accounted for.  All character classes, including multi-class characters, can be rolled up in a snap and will appear on ready-made character sheets with all the pertinent information ready to use.  You can even print these sheets for instant use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All magic items from the AD&amp;amp;D Dungeon Masters Guide (AD&amp;D 1e) and Unearthed Arcana, plus all treasure types from the Monster Manual (AD&amp;D 1e) and Monster Manual II (AD&amp;D 1e), can be generated with this powerful program.  By letting the computer do most of the number-crunching work, such time consuming chores as creating large numbers of gems, jewelry, or intelligent weapons become simple tasks.  Harness the power of the computer with this versatile utility - spend less time in preparation and more time enjoying AD&amp;amp;D game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
