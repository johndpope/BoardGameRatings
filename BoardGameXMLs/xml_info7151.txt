			<description>A  Landmark Game  based on volume 89 in the Landmark children's book series by Random House. For Ages 9 - 15&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a race starting from ground level to see who can be the first into orbit. The players start off with balloons and as they climb upwards various historical aircraft become available (including the Wright Flyer, Curtis Jenny, Spirit of St. Louis, P-51, F-104, and X-15). The higher the altitude reached, the more advanced the aircraft that may be acquired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features colorful components with an interesting gimmick or two - for instance, the spinners are part of a box insert depicting an aircraft control panel, and the players use a miniature compass to try and get a correct reading on a radar screen box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
