			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pulp adventure genre is full of exciting tales of larger than life characters, set in the 1920s-40s. What if you had pulp adventurers in the modern day? That is, modern people who somehow get turned into pulp heroes. Then the game is about two things:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     First, of course, they have thrilling adventures.&lt;br/&gt;     Second, the conflict between their pulpiness and their lives in the modern world where self-reliance and decisive action are the exception, not the rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dare adds rules for the distinctive self-confidence of pulp characters, which can carry them through or get them into trouble; pulp schticks; and strains from normal life that can interrupt their adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
