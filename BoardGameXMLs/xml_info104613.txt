			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;June 5, 1944. Just before dawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mission Commander calls you into his office. The briefing is classified as Top Secret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The mission is code named D-Day: Operation Overlord. It's the largest amphibious invasion of Europe in the history of man. We go tomorrow, and you're flying the first plane in.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questions instantly race through your mind. What plane will I fly? How reliable is my back up? Will there be ground support? Does the enemy know we're coming? Is this the turning point of the war?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operations can give you a full briefing. The control tower can guide you out. But ultimately, the outcome, victory or defeat, is in your hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     D-Day: Operation Overlord is the most historically accurate rendering of D-Day available. All airfields, coastal batteries, marshaling yards, and rocket launching sites are based on actual aerial photographs taken from recon missions flown during this period. Over 130 photographs have been borrowed from the Smithsonian Institution for this game. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     You choose from three of the most powerful single seat fighters used in World War II: the Spitfire, the Mustang or the Typhoon. All cockpits have been rendered historically accurate down to the last gauge. Even your opponents are historically correct. You'll dogfight against their best flying fortresses such as the Focke-Wulf 190, the Junkers 88 and the dreaded Messerschmitt 109, all recreated from actual photographs and models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     While based at Tangmere Air Field, you'll report to the Operations Room for a full briefing, the Planning Room to check the mission strategy, the Control Tower to check on flight conditions and your own quarters to review your flight journal and prepare for your mission. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     No two missions are identical. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
