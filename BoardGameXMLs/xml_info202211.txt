							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fiery Grog Tavern</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fiery Grog Tavern is a supplemental product that you can insert into your game when the characters need to visit a tavern. It can also serve as a springboard into the Madness of the Rat King adventure. This tavern is appropriate for all levels and group sizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fiery Grog is a popular watering hole for the more rough and tumble folk of Port Myrandu. The seedy tavern is often the meeting place for shady dealings kept hidden by the loud drunken activities that permeate the building each night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether your adventurers are meeting an important NPC in private, they&amp;rsquo;re in need of a quest hook or two to move the adventure forward, or looking to blow off some steam by partying hard and maybe get into a brawl, the Fiery Grog is the place to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting has unusually high production values and is distributed as six files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A 10-page PDF setting document&lt;br/&gt; - Two 1-page PDF full-color, high resolution maps&lt;br/&gt; - Three PNG full-color, high resolution maps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
