The game allows for three players at the same time, and is based on the online game &amp;quot;Ragnarok&amp;quot; by Gravity. Created by a Japanese fan circle, this game received an official endorsement and was widely spread even outside the &amp;quot;home made games&amp;quot; market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players create a character based on one of the classes (Fighter, Archer, Merchant, Mage etc) and advance through the stages. As they level up, the player can choose how to improve the characters. Level 20 is maximum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translated box back:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The famous Flash animation is now a playable game for real!&lt;br/&gt;A luxurious production with the full collaboration of the flash animation producer Syunpu Minamimuke, and the Korean Gravity Corp, the developer of the MMORPG &amp;quot;Ragnarok Online&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A true game version of the famous flash animation &amp;quot;Ragnarok Battle Online&amp;quot;!
