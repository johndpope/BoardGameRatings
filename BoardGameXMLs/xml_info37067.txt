			<description>Everybody plays at once. One person reads out a category name and ten items within that category (this is all provided in the file). Some of the items genuinely fall within the category whilst others don't. You have to decide how many of the correct answers you think you can correctly identify and then bid. But here's the dilemma: If you bid too high, you risk getting it wrong but if you bid too low, you might well be outbid. You've got to combine your knowledge of trivia with a little guesswork and a lot of guts to win !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
