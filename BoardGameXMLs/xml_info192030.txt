			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adding detailed descriptions to special items in your game can help immerse your players. For example, when PCs discover a potion, initially it isn&amp;rsquo;t a Potion of Healing or Potion of Invisibility. It is a potion that is a certain color, has a given consistency, has a particular smell and taste (if a PC tests it) and comes in one of many types of flasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF helps you to describe all of these properties of potions.  In addition it includes rules for expired or bad potions if you wish to consider those problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Below are several examples created using the tables:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Thin and bubbly, translucent red violet colored potion that smells like ginger and mustard and tastes like snake with a ginger and mustard aftertaste in a steel, tubular top, 3&amp;quot; long, 1&amp;quot; in diameter, triangular bottom 6&amp;quot; on a side flask.&lt;br/&gt;    Clumpy white potion with teal blue drops that smells like chives but tastes like pickled venison and mushrooms in a steel, tubular top, 3&amp;quot; long, 1&amp;quot; in diameter, triangular bottom 6&amp;quot; on a side flask. The potion is old... while it works, the subject feels itchy for the next 8 hours.&lt;br/&gt;    Jelly carnation pink potion that has no smell but tastes like kiwi and ginger in a clay, tubular top, 3&amp;quot; long, 1&amp;quot; in diameter, spherical bottom 6&amp;quot; in diameter flask. The potion was made by a novice and is only half as effective (Pick one: duration, hit points healed, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fizzy translucent plum potion that smells like kiwi but tastes like beef in a steel, tubular top, 2&amp;quot; long, 1&amp;quot; in diameter, rectangular bottom 6&amp;quot; x 8&amp;quot; x 2&amp;quot; flask.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
