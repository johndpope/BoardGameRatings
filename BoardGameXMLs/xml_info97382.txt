			<description>A game which starts the same way but then the board tiles shift and each game is now unique.&lt;br/&gt;'For 2 to 4 Adventurers' say the rules. You are dealt 3 room Cards and it is your objective to 'dynamite' each room so named. If you do this first and exit the board, you win. Each tile has a two digit number. You roll the dice to move and you must move the full throw (if you can't, you forfeit the throw) and you are allowed to change direction once. After moving, you check the pips on both dice, and this will relate to two tiles. Example; You roll a 5 and a 3, this will relate to tile 53 or tile 35, your choice. If you roll doubles, only one tile will be available. The tile you choose is picked up and placed somewhere else. It can be anyway round and it must be adjacent to an existing tile.There are special tiles in the game, for example, the Start tile or The Misty Mists tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
