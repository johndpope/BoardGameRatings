							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alien Assemblage</name>
									
			<description>In this upcoming card game based on the old dice game Beetle, you draw and play cards and hope to create an entire alien before something horrible happens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have a hand of 5 cards from a deck of 108 that contains body parts, as well as actions.  Draw a card from the deck, then play a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can add a body part to your alien - you need to collect a body, a head, two antenna, two arms, two wings, two legs and a tail - or you can play a card that affects an opponent by stealing one of their body parts or one of their cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch out for the red cards - these must be played immediately and could wipe out your hand.  And there's one card in the deck that destroys your entire alien!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
