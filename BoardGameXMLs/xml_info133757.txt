			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been twenty-three years since the body of Vormesh, God of Magic, fell to the Aerth, changing all of our lives forever. We still don&amp;rsquo;t know who or what could have slain a God, or why, all we know is what happened next. The body was massive, miles long. The capitol of the PanHumanoid League, Stormhaven, was wiped off the map, as Vormesh&amp;rsquo;s massive hand flattened it. The shockwave from his skull bouncing off of the Whitecap Mountain Range leveled the Monasticity of Ohm, home to the greatest concentration of holy men in all of Aerth. A dark bluish liquid poured from the wound in the back of the skull, filling the Sundown Valley and drowning the entire Halfling Nation in a single deluge of Godsblood. His other arm splashed into the Sea of Falling Tears, creating a tsunami last spotted headed towards the coastal port of Deepwater. A thousand stories have been told since we took refuge in the Tinker Gnome Tunnel Structure UGN 5740, those are some of the less personal, easier to relate ones. There are plenty more of children lost, families torn apart, loved ones killed in the crazy days immediately after the Descent, as it&amp;rsquo;s now known. Our Tunnel Leader has encouraged us all to keep diaries, both to keep us occupied, and to serve as a reminder, so that who we were is not completely forgotten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
