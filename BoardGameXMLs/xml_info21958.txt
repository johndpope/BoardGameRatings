			<description>This game was premium giveaway item to customers of Shell service stations to promote Twentieth Century Fox Film's theatrical release of their animated film, Anastasia. The game comes with the board folded into a triangular suitcase that holds plastic playing pieces of the movie's five main characters and a sheet that folds into a 6-sided die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is for players to safely arrive in Paris and defeat the evil Rasputan. They accomplish this by rolling the die to move ahead the indicated number of spaces. Once there, they must follow the directions on that space. To win, players must reach the last space and then be the first to make the correct die roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
