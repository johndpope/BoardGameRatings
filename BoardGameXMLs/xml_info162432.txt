			<description>Backpacker 2 was released in 1997 on two CD-ROMs. As of 2010, it had sold 600,000 copies in the Nordic countries. The game contains 70 destinations, 70 different jobs and 6,000 questions. It has two difficulty levels, Tourist and Globetrotter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Backpacker (series)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional User Summary&lt;br/&gt;The game is about traveling around to different cities in the world and answer questions about the locations. In order to get the money needed for traveling, the player have to take different jobs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There can be several different goals in the game. Either that travel around the world in the shortest time, to visit as many cities as possible or to get certificates in as many jobs as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compared to the first Backpacker there are a few gameplay changes; In this sequel you can travel by Plane, Train and Boat (in Backpacker you could only fly). Now there are two types of hotels; A cheap and a more expensive one, the advantage of the expensive hotel is that it will be easier to get a job in the city. This version also allows you to buy souvenirs which you can sell in other cities to gain some extra cash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiplayer over the Internet was now an option in Backpacker 2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
