							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Sun Skirmish</name>
									
			<description>A boardgame set in the AD&amp;amp;D Dark Sun campaign setting. Each player randomly selects a party of eight characters. To win the game a player must destroy all enemy characters. The characters come in several races, such as Halfling, Dwarf, Human, Elf, and Half Giant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on an 8x8 grid (a chessboard would suffice.) Miniatures or counters are used to represent the characters. A custom deck of cards is central to the play of the game. The players draw hands of cards from the common deck. Card play determines when units may move, attack, or defend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
