			<description>A Fantasy Role-Playing Game of Epic Narrative &amp;amp; The Tarot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swansong n. The fabled song of a swan just prior to its death, one's last work or final appearance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free will is a coveted possession of the few&amp;mdash;the heroes. Create a hero and carve out your own epic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harness the rich symbolism and story telling power of the tarot deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swansong focuses heavily on the player characters and their unfolding stories. Each PC will be driven to reach their individual goal, whilst at the same time being influenced by their ego.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately the characters must face their own personal demons under cosmic judgment. Only if this trial is passed can they go on to confront The Prince of Darkness&amp;mdash;whatever form he takes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And if they should falter&amp;mdash;It will be their swansong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game system is flexible and robust, Swansong can easily accommodate any kind of character. The tarot based resolution system is quick and elegant allowing almost seamless play, granting more narrative control to players than traditional RPGs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring a unique combat system, victory can be won or lost in an instant. Battles are fraught with risk and reversals of fortune, with the card mechanics allowing for strategy and bluff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swansong incorporates a tarot based scenario generator, providing you with the means of creating countless role-playing scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
