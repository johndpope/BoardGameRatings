			<description>The concept: Players compete for associate, bachelor's, master's and, finally, doctoral degrees in Bolognabalogical Science by advancing the pawns around a game board depicting the campus of Baloney State University. Each &amp;quot;student&amp;quot; rolls a die to collect vowels and consonants to make up a word with a nonsensical definition. Pawns are advanced by the forming of nonsense words with nonsense definitions from two sets of drawing cards-one for vowels, one for consonants (example: &amp;quot;hinduey: The saggy seat of a loosely worn pair of denim trousers&amp;quot;). Once a player's opponents have accepted a nonsense word and its definition, the player moves his game pawn one space for every letter in the word. Wild-card &amp;quot;Report Cards&amp;quot; add an element of chance (example: &amp;quot;You were caught engaging in the latest campus fad-mud puddle mopping-Report to the Dean`s Office-Don`t Roll!&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a board, pawns and die, plus a Baloney State University Student Handbook and a student newspaper, Tall Tales. The handbook provides photographs of the mock school's faculty. Sal Monilla is the cafeteria chef.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
