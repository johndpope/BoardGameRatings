			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the NCB Files, a free addition for the popular Dawn of Legends setting for the Savage Worlds RPG!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the Dawn of Legends book, numerous characters and groups were mentioned but did not actually appear in the character sections. This was due to space constraints: the new powers system already took-up so much space, that to include every character would have made the book so large that the price tag to print it would have caused the MSRP to be upwards of $50 or more. Not something we wanted for the book. So, the decision was made to cut the characters and groups, and release them shortly afterwards as a free download.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, we&amp;rsquo;re happy to give you 12 new Champions and 19 new Rogues to populate your Dawn of Legends campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the mystical trouble-shooting firm of Germaine Investigations, Inc. to the mysterious Liberty Corps., from the dangerous Lady&amp;rsquo; D&amp;rsquo;yre to the primal entity known as Nebecar, you&amp;rsquo;ll find a variety of characters and stories to challenge any Neo Super-Team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strap on your cape, slip into those tights, take to the streets . . . and build your Legend!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
