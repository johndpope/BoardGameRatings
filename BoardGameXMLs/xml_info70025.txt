			<description>&amp;quot;Mario Party 4 (マリオパーティ 4 Mario Pātī Fō) is the fourth installment in a series of board game style and is the first game in the series to be released for Nintendo Gamecube, featuring popular Nintendo characters. Mario Party 4 was released in North America on October 21, 2002, in Japan on November 8, 2002, and in the PAL region on November 29, 2002. It is the fourth game in the Mario Party series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mario Party 4 features eight characters from the Mario series, who can be directed as characters on six themed game boards in the game. The objective of the game is to earn as many stars as possible, which are obtained by purchase from a single predefined space on the game board. Each character's movement is determined by a roll of a die, with a roll from each player forming a single turn. Each turn in Mario Party 4 is followed by a minigame, which is competed to earn money for the character, used to buy items and stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mario Party 4 received a generally positive reaction from the media, although there were several complaints regarding a lack of originality and slow pacing during games. The game won the &amp;quot;Family Game of The Year&amp;quot; award at the Interactive Achievement Awards of 2003.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mario_Party_4,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
