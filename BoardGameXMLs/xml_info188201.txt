			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Time Traveller is an adaptation of the Dr. Who television series to table-top role-playing.  The system presented is a modified and adapted version of White Wolf's Storyteller System.  Characters have Attributes which have Ratings numbered 0-6, which determines how many dice are in the pool for that Attribute.  Attributes include Dexterity, Knowledge, Mechanical, Perception, Strength, and Technical.  The player distributes 18 points (hence, dice) among them.  Characters also have a list of Skills, with 24 points (hence, dice) divided among them.  Characters purchase Advantages by spending Character Points.  Finally, characters are equipped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The HTML game is presented in two major sections:  Rule Book and Supplements.  There is little to differentiate the two entries--supplements tend to be lists of things.  The Rule Book section includes:  Game Mechanics, Character Creation, Template Types, Character Skill List, Special Ability List, Species List, Game Systems, and Combat Systems.  The Supplements section includes:  Merits &amp;amp; Flaws, Antagonist List, Biodata Extracts, Block-Transfer Rotes, Vehicles &amp;amp; Movement, and Equipment List.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
