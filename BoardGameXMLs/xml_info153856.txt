			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chebyshev Function is a story roleplaying game about teenagers with psionic powers &amp;mdash; known as primes &amp;mdash; who are chased by the government. Forced to live outside the convenience of modern life, the characters must &amp;ldquo;go underground&amp;rdquo; to protect themselves from those who would do them harm. As the story progresses, the teenagers find themselves face to face with very real dangers that will test them, their friendships, and their will to live.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Protocol game series uses vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles to tell a story. Each story explores disparate characters dealing with adversity and isolation in a dramatic fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chebyshev Function is a zero-prep game for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. Home requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This series presumes some understanding of GMless game protocol: scene-framing, shared authority, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
