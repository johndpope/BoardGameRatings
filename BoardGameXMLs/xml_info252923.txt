							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Gobbler</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the weather grows cold many people take the forests in search of meat for food. The large flocks of turkeys make a prime target for these hunts. Unfortunately for these would be hunters, it is is the late fall when the creatures known as the gobblers also appear.  Supposedly they are born from the eggs of mundane turkeys on rare occasion and will act as sort of guardians for the rest of the flock.  Highly aggressive and difficult to kill, these creatures are more than a match for the hunters that normally stumble upon them.  But legend says they are delicious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add this strange creature to your games of Raven of the Scythe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
