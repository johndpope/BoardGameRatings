			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reuben Hall disppeared from his parents' home last night. He out there somewhere, the captive of a creature of the Unknown. The police are looking for him diligently, but they don't know what they're looking for or the nature of what they're facing - but you do. You're members of the Eternal Society of the Silver Way, dedicated to protecting others from the Unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have very little time, though. Will you stand with us? Remember &amp;mdash; SAVE is on your side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chill 3rd Edition is an investigative horror roleplaying game about people who stand up against monsters, hunting down supernatural threats and protecting the world from the Unknown. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a superhero to be a member of SAVE; you just have to stand up and join us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good Fences Make Good Neighbors is a free scenario for Chill 3rd Edition. It includes all the rules you need to play it, and comes with five pre-generated characters. The scenario plays in two to four hours, depending on your group, and serves as an introduction into the game system and setting of Chill 3rd Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
