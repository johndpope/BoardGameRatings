							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Orc Fortress</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Towering, gloomy and impressive, the orc fortress stands on top of a bare rocky platform. A sloped ramp connects the gateway of the fortress. Orc kings and shamans of the past built the fortress, over a conquered dwarven settlement. Nothing remains of the settlement but the level of the crypts, far beneath the ground. The orc fortress consists of three levels plus two underground levels. The ground level hosts barracks and troops lodging as well as a defensive system made of arrowslits and defensive devices. Two sturdy portcullises protect the main courtyard. On level one, more barracks are found and a great number of catapults defend the fortress from all sides. Level two houses the warlord&amp;rsquo;s apartments and a great balcony overlooking the entire area. Below the ground level, there is the temple area. The Temple of the Eye dominates the area and the clerics&amp;rsquo; lodgings surround the temple. In addition, a secret way connects this level with an underground caverns complex. Deeper is found the old dwarven crypt complex, now converted to orcs&amp;rsquo; crypts.&lt;br/&gt;Some hints to use the fortress follow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A princess has been kidnapped from the orc warlord and taken to the fortress. The PCs are charged with the duty to rescue her. An old shaman shows the party a secret entrance below the fortress.&lt;br/&gt;     An army of the good is besieging the fortress from months. The war is a stalemate. In order to solve the problem the commander of the good army send the PCs through a secret passage underground with the order of killing the orc warlord. The PCs are betrayed and captured and the army of good blackmailed with the PCs life. The PC must flee and perhaps kill the warlord.&lt;br/&gt;     The fortress is abandoned from centuries, after falling under the armies of good. The PCs find shelter in the fortress during a stormy night. The fortress is cursed and shifts in a demiplane where the ghosts of the orcs fight their last battle forever. The PCs must find a way to exit the demiplane.&lt;br/&gt;     The PCs are captured and taken to the fortress. While in they learn about a wicked orc shaman who plans to extend the orcs&amp;rsquo; domain over the surrounding regions using a powerful magic device. The PCs must find and destroy the device..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
