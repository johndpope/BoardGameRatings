			<description>The Lord of the Rings Online: Rise of Isengard is the latest expansion pack for the MMORPG The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar, released on September 27, 2011. This is the third expansion pack for The Lord Of The Rings Online and, like the previous expansion, it is available a web-based download only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rise of Isengard officially brings the game's timeline to the events of The Two Towers. Players accompany the Grey Company as they ride to the aid of Aragorn, traveling through the new areas of Dunland, The Gap of Rohan, and the legendary region of Isengard, seat of Saruman the White. New game enhancements include a level cap increase to 75, level 75 legendary items, a new crafting tier, a 24-man raid, stat cap removal and improved virtue traits. There were also several major class revisions; the minstrel and the champion classes, in particular. The Epic Story was update with Volume 3 Book 4: The Rise of Isengard and introduced such iconic characters as Grimbold, Th&amp;eacute;odred, Grima Wormtongue and Saruman the White.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Lord of the Rings Online: Rise of Isengard&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
