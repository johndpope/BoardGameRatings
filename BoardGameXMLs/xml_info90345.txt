			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SpongeBob SquarePants: Lights, Camera, Pants! is a platformer based on the SpongeBob SquarePants television series. In the game, the popular television series &amp;ldquo;The New Adventures of Mermaidman and Barnacle Boy&amp;rdquo; is in trouble. The cast has not shown up, and it is up to SpongeBob to find a replacement cast before the show is taken off the air!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The level designs mimic classic platformers such as Super Mario Bros 2, and the player must guide SpongeBob to the end of each stage where he encounters a level boss. The bosses are combated using a Dance Dance Revolution style rhythm challenge. In addition, players have the option of playing a number of mini-games between stages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gameboy Advance version of the game differs significantly from both the PC and home console versions, which are puzzle-adventure and party games, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
