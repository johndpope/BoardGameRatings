			<description>La Aventura Fantistica (Spanish for &amp;quot;A Fantasy Adventure&amp;quot;) is a Spanish game based on the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons cartoon consisting of 92 cards that are split into 4 decks of 23 cards. (The decks are Hank the Ranger's bow, Diana the Acrobat's javelin, Presto the Magician's hat and pouch, and Bobby the Barbarian's club and helmet with these images printed on the reverse of the cards.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each shuffled deck there are 10 Adventure cards marked with the letter A, 4 Dragon cards marked with the letter D, 4 Dungeon cards marked with the letter M (&amp;quot;mazmorass&amp;quot; is Spanish for dungeon), 2 Force cards marked with the letter F, 1 Bifurcation card marked with the letter B, 1 Exit card marked with the letter S (&amp;quot;salida&amp;quot; is Spanish for exit) and 1 Treasure card marked with the letter T. The aim of the game is to pick a card each turn and win by collecting 3 Dragon cards, 1 Exit card and 1 Treasure card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon cards can be collected by using a previously picked Force card against it, with the Force card then being discarded. If the player has no Force card then instead he can roll the dice; a star result means he has defeated the dragon and can keep the Dragon card, a result of 4 means a stalemate and he must discard the Dragon card but a result of 1 to 3 means he has been defeated and must reshuffle his entire deck (current deck, discarded cards and kept cards) and start again. Alternatively, the player can decide to not roll a dice, discard the Dragon card and in future he picks from a different deck; whether occupied by another player or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Picking a Dungeon card means that the player must miss a go and discard this card. Picking a Bifurcation card means that the player must pick from another deck for the next turn only and discard this card. Adventure cards do nothing and are discarded. Each deck has its own discard pile; there is not one central discard pile made up from different decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
