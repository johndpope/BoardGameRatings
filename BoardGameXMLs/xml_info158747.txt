			<description>Think fast as the first player in Knee Jerk to give their knee-jerk reaction wins the point! Players rapidly create endings to funny situations in this 4-8 player party game. Each situation lasts ten seconds, and players get to play simultaneously (i.e. no downtime!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player plays as the host, rapidly choosing and announcing situations. The first player to create a valid ending to the situation wins the point. If more than one player answers, the host picks his favorite. The first player to gain three points is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
