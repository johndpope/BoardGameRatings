			<description>User Summary: Game Chef 2010 Design Competition Submission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subtitle: What Will Your Life Story Be?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;So what is this game all about?&lt;br/&gt;Well its a story game about life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a group of friends you get to make up a set of stories about people. These won&amp;rsquo;t be detailed sagas. Instead we&amp;rsquo;ll dip into the lives of these characters at key points in their lives and find out a little about who they are and how they think. Some of the stories might be amusing, some sad, but they should all tell us something about the characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most important part of the game though is seeing what these people leave behind:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     How does the world change as a result of their actions?&lt;br/&gt;     How are they remembered?&lt;br/&gt;     How did they make a difference?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
