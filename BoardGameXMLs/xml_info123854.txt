			<description>A statistical sports game, focusing on the indoor soccer leagues of the MISL. Designed to play quickly so that a whole season can be played in one evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team is rated in various areas of skills. The statistics are in the form of paper sheets rather than cards. Dice are used to determine results of actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My set dates from 1990 and includes season stats for 1988 to 1990.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
