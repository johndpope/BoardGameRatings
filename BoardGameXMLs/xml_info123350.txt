							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great Space Race</name>
									
			<description>The Great Space Race (usually abbreviated to TGSR) is a combination role-playing game and science-fiction space combat game. The basic premise of the game is that a new super-drink called Natof has been discovered. Natof has three key properties, which are to get the person drunk, never leave him with a hangover, and supply him with all the nutrition required from a well-balanced (if never sober) diet.  The name Natof is a portmanteau of the phrase &amp;quot;NAme TO Follow&amp;quot; - the sentence sent with the first batch of miracle drink by the discoverer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The manual describes the game as &amp;quot;a true computer movie. The player can just watch events unfold, joining in as much or as little as he wishes.&amp;quot; The objective is &amp;quot;to deliver, to the space stations as much Natof as the player can, as fast as he can.&amp;quot; The game will play itself if left alone &amp;mdash; indeed the computer generally makes a better player than a human does &amp;mdash; although that rather defeats the point of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great Space Race was hotly anticipated as the follow-up to Legend's popular and influential graphic adventure Valhalla. Pre-release publicity boasted that the game contained &amp;quot;technical effects never before seen in home computer software&amp;quot;, with &amp;quot;true solid 3D graphics&amp;quot;. The game was actually coded largely in BASIC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Great Space Race (computer game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
