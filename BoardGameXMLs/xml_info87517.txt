Interaction charts are provided to explain politics between Knight Orders and a selection of Non-Player Characters are also included to spice the game up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heraldry and Emblems are also explained and rules have been provided to develop new emblems and crests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New rules include additional background for Centaur characters (introduced in the Darkun Sourcebook) with the introduction of the Batica Class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four additional Classes are also introduced: Chronicler, Duellist, Herald and Myrmidon. Horse types are also covered here with their statistics and descriptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonus Material: Knight Jousts, Imperial Keep game aid and family of Nardam genealogy tree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenario&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complete scenario is provided at the back of the book (Sanctity of The Earth) and assists in introducing Knights to a crowd of screaming, hysterical, pitchfork and torch shaking villagers!
