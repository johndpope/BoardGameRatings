			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; VAPORWARE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is stuck in the development limbo known as Vaporware. Few to no details have been released about about its gameplay, plot, or release date since its announcement many years ago. It may or may not be in active development, but neither has it been cancelled officially.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game combines action with RPG and RTS. The player will control a hero who can command various troops. The player has full control of their character and can run around freely with their troops following them. When controlling other units, the game plays like a typical RTS and you can move troops, change their formations and make them perform various actions. Cannons for example can be used to break down castle walls and spearmen can be used to protect troops from cavalry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Kingdom Under Fire II&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
