			<description>In a far away ocean the five most renowned privateers were determined to find who among them was the most cunning and brave. They decided to find out by playing a great race. &lt;br/&gt;The game is divided in two phase:&lt;br/&gt;1. Starting with the first player (which is the one who choose the dominant suit) each player will play one card, with the objective to win the hand. A card is playable if the suit is the same as the suit played by the first player. The highest value card will win the hand, and the player who won it will become the first player for the next hand. &lt;br/&gt;2. When the card game comes to an end, it's time to move the ships. The player which called for the dominant suit, will start moving his/her ship toward the finish a number of spaces equal the number of hands he won in the card game. &lt;br/&gt;To win the game, the players must reach the Pirate's Isle sited in the center of the board, using your cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
