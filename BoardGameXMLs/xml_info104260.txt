			<description>Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your presence here affects everything. Each step you take is crucial. Every game is different.&lt;br/&gt;You are Saul Meyers, a decorated Legionnaire. Your daughter has disappeared in the hostile South American jungle. You must fight for her life, and yours.&lt;br/&gt;Forget linear games with levels and download times. This is real life.&lt;br/&gt;Despite the massive 625 km2 you have to explore, the feeling of claustrophobia is immense. In this new breed of action game tempers will rise and you'll need more than your fists to survive. Arm yourself with new weapons and heavy artillery and outsmart the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;Your enemies take things personally and they never forget. &lt;br/&gt;Every action you make will come back to haunt you. And with the army, Guerrillas, and Mafia on to you, you'd better watch your back. Help them out, or blast your way through. Either way, the heat is up and you'll be pushed... to Boiling Point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
