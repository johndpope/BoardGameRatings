			<description>In this game, two players talk on a &amp;quot;phone&amp;quot; (or any device held to the active player's ear). Before they start, a spinner determines a subject for the call and a matching taboo word. The caller also decides whether he/she wants to talk for 20-40, 40 to 60 or 60 to 90 seconds. A third player controls the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the caller picks up the phone piece, the person who is called has to involve the caller in a conversation, trying to force him/her to use the taboo word or the words yes or no, which are also taboo. Whenever the caller uses one of these words, he/she gets a headache pill (but the conversation continues). &lt;br/&gt;During the conversation, the caller has to try and estimate how much time has passed. When he/she thinks the time is within the chosen limits, he or says goodbye and puts down the &amp;quot;phone&amp;quot;. If he/she was within the chosen limits, he/she gets one, two or three points, depending on the length of the call. Then the next player makes a call.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two headache pills count minus one point. The player with most points (or, frequently, with least negative points) after an agreed number of calls is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
