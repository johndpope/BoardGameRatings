			<description>In Normandy '44 players relive the largest single amphibious invasion in military history. This game is a recreation of the forces, strengths and positions of the Allied and German forces on the morning of June 6th 1944&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing board is a map of the five landing beaches and surrounding areas divided into 120 different sectors with a variety of different terrain types including water, beach, field, forest and towns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing pieces are cardboard squares representing AA guns, Artillery, Bombers, coastal Guns, Fighters, Landing craft, Soldiers, Tanks, U-Boats and Warships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is turn based. The rulebook is short and sweet, at only eight pages in length. This does lead to some confusion, however, as some of the rules need clarifying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was released in Canada.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
