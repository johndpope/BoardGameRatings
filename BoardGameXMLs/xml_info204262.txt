			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of many children kidnapped and experimented upon by the evil genius, DR. CHRYSALIS, young Ben Barrow grew up to discover that his genetics had been altered, endowing him with the speed, strength, and agility of a spider! Frightened and nervous at first, he spent much of his free time in his teen years learning how to use his abilities so that he could live up to the example set by the heroes who once saved him from the clutches of evil. Now that he's graduated high school, he's built up the courage (and put together a cool costume) to act in the open as the super powered here, ARACHNIMAN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
