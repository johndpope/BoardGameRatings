							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sakhalin 1945</name>
									
			<description>This game concerns one of the last battles of World War 2. The invasion of the Southern Sakhalin and the Kuriles by the Soviet Union. This was done in conjunction with the invasion of Japanese held Manchuria and Korea in the wake of the atom bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Soviets surprisingly had a hard time in taking the Sakhalins and the Kuriles even though they outnumbered the defenders and had overwhelming advantage in firepower, the Japanese defenders fought fanatically and there were still pockets of Japanese resistance at the time of the armistice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Sakhalin 1945&amp;quot; consists of 86 pieces, a 29.5 x 42 cm map (printed in English) and 10 pages of rules (in Japanese). The map covers from the Japanese/Soviet border at the 50th Parallel through the strategic town of Koton. Turn length is twelve hours and units are a platoon, companies or battalions. Player numbers are one or two and playing time is two hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Came out in Six angles #3 and as part of the Six angles collection&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
