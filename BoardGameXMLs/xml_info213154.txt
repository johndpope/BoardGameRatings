							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quintet</name>
									
			<description>Quintet is a &amp;quot;crew&amp;quot; game where players work together to control the same space ship. There are 5 roles: Captain, Helm, Tactical, Engineering and Science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAPTAIN: The Captain's role is to not only be a good leader, but a good communicator. Good communication will lead to a successful mission. If a crew member is getting out of line, the Captain can eject them, and when all else fails, there is always the self-destruct button.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HELM: Driving a ship through three dimensions is not for the weak of heart. Flying is not only about dodging asteroids and other ships. The Helm operator needs to get the ship in position so Tactical, Engineering and Science officers can do their jobs optimally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TACTICAL: Tactical controls the weapons. It's their job to lock on a target, fire and blow stuff up. Choose that right moment to unleash the most powerful cannon. Additionally, they can calibrate the beam frequency to penetrate enemy shields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ENGINEER: They may not get all the glory, but the Engineer is the one who actually gives more power to the shields. Additionally, they can hack an enemy to drop their shields, weapons or engines or boost an ally. The Engineer is the only person who can repair the ship's hull.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCIENCE: The Science officer is the ship's special effects guru. They can tractor beam (push or pull) a friend or foe. Teleport the ship into its weapons range or make a quick escape even through an asteroid. They can also scan an enemy ship to detect their hull strength and shield frequency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
