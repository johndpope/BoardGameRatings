			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deadly ocean predators walking among us! Implacable hunters seeking to sate their endless hunger on land as well as in the sea!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weresharks are the ultimate predators, able to move on land and underwater with equal ease. Some never rise above the endless hunting and eating of their shark side, but others, it's rumored, infiltrate civilized society, becoming more dangerous by hiding their terrifying habits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bite Me! Weresharks describes a race of natural shapechangers who can terrorize with just a smile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bite Me! Weresharks contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Rules for creating wereshark characters using the Bite Me! lycanthrope system, including new racial traits and feats (from Horrific Gorging to Stunning Tail Attack)&lt;br/&gt;    New wereshark magic items (from teeth of the shark king to the Sky Hammer), and equipment (including shark tooth nets and spears)&lt;br/&gt;    Details of wereshark life and society.&lt;br/&gt;    Bonus discussion and rules for creating sharkweres -- deadly sharks that can take on the form of people.&lt;br/&gt;    Four completely statted (in both human and hybrid forms) ready-to-use wereshark and sharkwere NPCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
