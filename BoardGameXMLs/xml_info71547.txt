			<description>&amp;quot;Death Knights of Krynn is the second in a three-part series of Dragonlance Advanced Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons &amp;quot;Gold Box&amp;quot; computer role-playing games, published by Strategic Simulations, Inc. The game was released in 1991.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story is a continuation of the events after Champions of Krynn and is followed by The Dark Queen of Krynn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One year after the defeat of Myrtani, the party, now stationed at Gargath Outpost, has had little to do. The outpost is soon attacked by undead forces. The party's old colleague, Sir Karl, is revealed to be brought back from the grave as an undead death knight under the command of the evil Lord Soth. Soth has been raising dead, great warriors and turning them into his own evil undead forces. His primary goal is to possess the body of the legendary hero Sturm Brightblade. He and his vast undead armies now threaten the land. It is up to the party to overcome this threat.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Death_Knights_of_Krynn,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
