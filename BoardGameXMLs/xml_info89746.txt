							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Winter Voices: Nowhere of Me</name>
									
			<description>You advance in your adventure alone in the middle of the tundra and attempt to follow a forgotten trail, marked by ruins of ancient stopovers and roaming animals. Your unconscious' voices are submitting you to harrowing internal battles, which you must overcome to carry on with your reconstruction. Your future takes shape as you battle your way through an inhumane nature. Will you be strong enough to face your demons, the fear of loneliness and the temptation of death?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game alternates real-time phases for dialog, world exploration and turn-based combat that requires reflection and strategy, with a choice of more than 100 skills for a unique confrontation with your destiny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
