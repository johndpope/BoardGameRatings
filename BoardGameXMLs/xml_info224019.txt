							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster of the Month #1: Basajuan (5E)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster of the Month brings to life a new monster from ancient folklore every single month for both Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 5th Edition and the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. Created using actual folklore gathered by Justin Andrew Mason then expertly illustrated by AAW Games' lead artist Mates Laurentiu (Romania), the monsters are then crafted by Stephen Rowe (Pathfinder RPG) and Chris Harris (5th Edition).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hulking bipedal figure approaches. It is redolent of pungent musk. Lumbering nearly seven feet tall, the being might be mistaken for a very large human if not for a scant coat of fur. Dark hair (and tangled beard) contrast with its ruddy verdant-toned flesh. The creature moves with cunning and deliberate swagger whilst outfitted with a primitive hide loincloth and crude stone-knapped weaponry. Its wide eyes narrow as its attention focuses on every movement. A dissonance of short grunts call out as it dons an offensive posture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basajaun is a caveman like woodland dweller from Basque mythology. The creature was considered to be a protector of livestock, and a teacher to early humans. Legends suggest that the basajaun introduced humans to agriculture, and taught them how to cultivate nature to their advantage. Its name can be loosely translated to mean &amp;ldquo;Lord of the Forest&amp;rdquo; and is said to have dwelled within the Pyrenees Mountains. A natural enemy of wolves, the basajaun often befriended shepherds and offered protection to their flocks. Their innate connection as nature spirits also made them privy to the natural world, and distant thunder could be construed as the warning cries of basajaun warning of an approaching storm. Interestingly, some fringe theories suggest that the mythical creature known as the basajaun may actually be a vestigial memories of early Human encounters with Neanderthal, as the Iberian Peninsula from which the myth hails was also one of the last locales the species inhabited before going extinct.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
