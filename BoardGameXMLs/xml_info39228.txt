			<description>Klapse - German for &amp;quot;Nuthouse&amp;quot; - is a Monopoly-like roll-and-move game with a strong satirical approach. There are two &amp;quot;circles&amp;quot; - the &amp;quot;locked ward&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;open ward&amp;quot; - for the pawns to walk around and step on &amp;quot;event&amp;quot;-spaces of different kinds: New diagnosis, several events ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players try to get their pawns from the &amp;quot;locked&amp;quot; into the &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; ward and from there to freedom stepping on a &amp;quot;discharge&amp;quot; space. In the beginning, players draw a &amp;quot;diagnosis&amp;quot;, which reduces their possibilities in walking forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many satirical cards and texts on the board, plus in the &amp;quot;active&amp;quot; variant (the full game) players can discard their &amp;quot;diagnosis&amp;quot; cards, when acting out the symptoms ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game without depth or strategic approach, but a pure mock and fun game about psychiatrists and looney bins - mainly made for people working in that area (the publisher is specialized in critical literature about psychiatry).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
