			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenge friends and family in a exciting letter game with a strategic twist. You build the board &amp;ndash; but be smart every tile and board is worth points. If you win you become Wordious!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spent time playing word puzzle games? Feel it is time for a change? Well meet Wordious&amp;hellip; The new word puzzle game with an element of surprise. Wordious is like nothing you have ever seen before, what will happen when you need to place your letters on a gameboard that is made up by tiles, tiles that you and your opponents take turns placing.&lt;br/&gt;Wordious is a family game with classic board game elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Each player draws seven letter tiles. Then the board tiles are divided among the players. &lt;br/&gt;    At the beginning of a player's turn, he/she can choose to place a board tile. Each board tile is printed double-sided. If a player decided to place a board tile, he/she has to play a word on that tile and link it to a word on.&lt;br/&gt;    After the player has placed a word, he/she draws as many letters as played.&lt;br/&gt;    The game ends when a player has no letters left or everyone passes. &lt;br/&gt;    Every unplayed board tile is worth 15 points at the end of the game. Unplayed letters are penalized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is like a modular Scrabble game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
