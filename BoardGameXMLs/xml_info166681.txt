			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Formula 1 championship of 1976.   James Hunt and Nikki Lauda are battling out to see who will be the champion for the year.  Re-create the drama and excitement of this terrific year of motor racing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using your skill in acceleration and braking, managing your tyres and fuel you will battle it out to see who wins the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an all skill game, with no luck and no dice.  You will rely entirely on your skill to out-finesse your opponents and come in first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1976 Formula One is suitable for players aged 12 and upwards and can be played solo or with 2-8 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full colour race map&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8 cars in colours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8 car control mats in matching colours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;40 Markers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each driver can allocate 12 points between Engines, Brakes and Tyres.  Throughout the race, drivers may use these to boost their performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn Sequence&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lead car moves first, the inside car moves before an outside car.   You have 5 seconds to move your car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The car must move the number of squares indicated on the gear stick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the turn the driver sets a new speed, normally plus or minus 1 the current speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next player should already be making their move while you are doing this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The driver may use one ENGINE point (reduce the marker on the car tile) to accelerate an additional 1 speed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The driver may use one BRAKE point (reduce the marker on the car tile) to decelerate an additional 1 speed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Handling Corners&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the car moves onto the tile too fast then the car crashes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the car moves onto the tile at too fast, the driver can use tyre points to stay on the road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
