			<description>user comment&lt;br/&gt;deadEarth is a game of survival set in a bleak post apocalyptic world. Character driven play is backed up by a simple d6 based system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the Players - Always use skill over cunning and brawl, no matter how devious and physically adept you may be. Play with imagination and caution. If it seems too easy to die in deadEarth, that's because it is. Only one will mourn for your death, and that is you. Take heed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the Game Master - You, too, are a player, though more powerful than the rest. Be creative in your campaigns and open-minded with your decisions. If a player has an idea, hear him/her out. If the player is wrong s/he will die for it later. Remember that you alone control a player's surroundings; if a player steps out of line warn him/her. If the player does it again, treat him/her cruelly without mercy. If the player persists, destroy him/her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
