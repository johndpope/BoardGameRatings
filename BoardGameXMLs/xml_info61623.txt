			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A ready-to-play adventure for RuneQuest, including full-color battle maps and cardboard figures for all NPCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A young girl has disappeared and the heroes have only a few hours to rescue her before her captors carry her to the slave market. A classic plot in any fantasy roleplaying, except that here the action takes place in thirteenth century Italy, and that the girl&amp;rsquo;s prison is not a monster-filled dungeon but an Arabian district in a European city. However, the rescuers will soon discover that this labyrinth of alleys can host more dangers and more magic than a haunted cave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This classic adventure for the Stupor Mundi setting is presented in a fancy, re-edited, all-colour format, complete with every visual aid needed to play it. This 28-page booklet includes ten pages of full colour battle maps and cardboard figures in addition to the adventure as originally printed in the Stupor Mundi supplement, so if you have already read the adventure in the book and want to play it, get this package at once!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requires the RuneQuest core rulebook and the RuneQuest Companion, or the RuneQuest Deluxe book, all available from Mongoose Publishing and here. Ownership of the Stupor Mundi supplement, available here, is recommended but not required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
