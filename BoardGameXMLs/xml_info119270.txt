							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Ein Wochenende in Berlin</name>
									
			<description>The game board shows a map of Berlin. Players roll a die and move through the city, trying to reach the famous sites (especially those two whose cards they drew at the beginning and which are marked). Additionally, taxis, buses and the tube can be used to get around more quickly, but they have to be paid for in travel chips. When a player reaches a site, s/he is asked a question. If answering correctly, the site card can be discarded and a new travel chip is drawn. When reaching an unmarked site, they can earn a new site card (if that belongs to someone else, it can be &amp;quot;stolen&amp;quot;). &lt;br/&gt;When a player can reach both sites they drew at the beginning and gain two more site cards and return to their starting location, s/he wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card has two questions, one about German, one a trivia question, so language learners can play it with non-language learners as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
