							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big Boom... or Golden Age</name>
									
			<description>This Cold War game seems to have been propaganda for the brand-new United Nations. It's a roll-and-move affair, but with one player playing the Atom Bomb and moving around a doomsday-clock circle while the other 1-5 players move Nation pieces cooperatively on a spiral toward the goal of a single world government through the UN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components include 8 lettered Nation pieces, 34 Vote cards, 36 Goodnews cards, 36 Badnews cards and markers for the A-bomb and the number of its trips around the clock. The Nation players on their turns roll two dice and can move any of the pieces by either or both dice. Each starts with a single Vote card and adds another each time a Nation piece reaches the center or when a third Nation is moved onto a space with two others. There are spaces marked with a &amp;quot;?&amp;quot;, and when a Nation lands on such a space, the Nations players each get to draw and act on a Goodnews card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bomb player also rolls two dice, and can use them either to move the bomb forward or to move one or two Nations backward onto a &amp;quot;?&amp;quot; by exact count. If the Bomb player does so, all Nations players must take and act on a Badnews card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Bomb player completes a number of circuits that varies with the number of players, the world blows up and the Bomb player wins. If the Nation players get all of the nations to the middle to spell &amp;quot;One World&amp;quot;, the UN brings all the peoples of the world together in a new Golden Age, where &amp;quot;taxes are a joke, starvation and illiteracy are gone, disease is conquered, you still have money to burn... and your workday is cut in two. Yippee!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
