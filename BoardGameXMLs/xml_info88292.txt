							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Microlite20: Purest Essence</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paul Lessack has kindly contributed a beautifully laid-out version of Microlite20. Weighing in at 17 pages, it's a 1.4Mb pdf that's as close to my vision of a complete professional Edition of Microlite20 as I've seen to date. It includes Character Generation, Combat, Advancement, Monsters, Equipment, Spells and the full Expert rules and GM Guide too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This edition also contains the expert rules for Microlite20:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This rule-set allows for introducing a few more options to your Microlite20 game, without necessarily increasing its complexity. Included are: a new skill, new races, new classes, and some other (hopefully) good stuff. It is not necessary to use Microlite20 Expert Rules in its entirety; DMs are encouraged to &amp;quot;cherry pick&amp;quot; those specific items applicable to their own campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
