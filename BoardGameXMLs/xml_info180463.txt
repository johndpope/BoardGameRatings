							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lich</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death.&lt;br/&gt;A being both known and unknown to you. You casually give and take souls to and from Death as you please. You create mockeries of souls to inhabit the corpses you raise. They are imperfect, of course. A mere mortal cannot hope to imitate the precision required to make a soul.&lt;br/&gt;Not that you are one.&lt;br/&gt;You are the Lich. You, whose soul is housed inside a seemingly mundane item, have spat on Death&amp;rsquo;s face. Regardless of race, heritage, or wealth, Death will have his eyes on you. Whether it be religious zealots or glory-seekers, Death will stare.&lt;br/&gt;And you, Lich, will gladly stare back at him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lich is the epitome of undead monsters, and now, you can play as one! Raise and command the dead. Use your touch to drain the life out of the living. Practice necrotic rituals. Improve upon your phylactery, the receptacle for your soul. Eventually, you will become a demilich.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The lich playbook, with over 20 moves. In addition, the playbook includes 6 phyactery moves, and an ultimate move, which you can take at level 11.&lt;br/&gt;    New tags, equipment, and monsters.&lt;br/&gt;    An adventure front designed with the lich in mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
