							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Voir Dire: The Game of Lawyers, Jurors, and Justice</name>
									
			<description>Voir Dire is the legal name for the process by which attorneys select a jury to try a case.  Each party has the right to question potential jurors, try to understand their biases and the kinds of arguments that may be effective in reaching those jurors, strike potential jurors from the jury through the use of peremptory challenges, and then craft and focus an argument in an effort to win the selected jury to their cause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game of Voir Dire, players are lawyers representing different parties attempting to influence a trial jury to decide in their favor.  This strategic game simulates the voir dire process and allows the players to bluff, plan, and manipulate the jury toward their desired outcome for the case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Voir Dire is played by two players and takes about ten minutes per game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
