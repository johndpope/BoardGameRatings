			<description>Kumasi blends classic abstract strategy with collector card game elements to help redefine both genres. With intense turn based decision making and deep strategical depth players are lost in the near limitless possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kumasi is a two-player card game where players take turns drawing and placing one card each as they try to make a four-sided shape in their color, either black of purple, on which they place one of their gems. Play continues until all cards have been placed and then quadrilaterals on the &amp;quot;outside&amp;quot; also receive a gem; the player with the most gems placed wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
