			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blocking the sun with a massive wingspan, Darkwind soars the skies about Torue Albes, serving as the Master of the Hunt&amp;rsquo;s eyes. He watches and waits, his shrill cries guiding his master to his latest prey... and when the moment is right, he strikes, knocking unwary sailors into the perilous water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cost: 12.&lt;br/&gt;Avatar: Master of the Hunt only.&lt;br/&gt;Power: Trapmaster&lt;br/&gt;Minions: 4 Razorwings, 3 Master Razorwings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkwind enter play at Weeping Reach and may only move along Water and Secret Trails, but may not travel through the Great Maelstrom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkwind may move up to 2 trails per week, even if carrying a Quest Item and has Fly and Knockback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
