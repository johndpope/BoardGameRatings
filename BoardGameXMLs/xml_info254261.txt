			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Classcraft is a robust online enabling tool to &amp;quot;gamify&amp;quot; the classroom.  While very basic functionality is free to access, the tool is definitively intended as a subscription service.  The teacher sets up a class and adds students to the class roster.  Each student then receives a student access code and a parent access code.  With their parents, the student can access the online tool and create their own character, selecting appearance, class, name, and a few other options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The character is tied directly to the student's behavior in class - encouraged student behaviors result in the character gaining experience points; discouraged student behaviors result in the character losing hit points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students may expend experience points to gain specific powers, which vary by class.  Some of these powers apply to the character, but some grant the student real-world privileges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The online tool allows web access from any internet location, and changes made by students and the teacher are reflected in real time.  Parents are enabled to review progress, restrict activities, and so forth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
