			<description>Adventures through the broken dream of humankind&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As we always knew it would be the fall of humankind was one of our own making, although not in the way any of us predicted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It happened in an instant. The collective unconscious, the shared imagination of all humankind, cracked open like a dam and fantasy flooded reality. The boundaries between imaginary and real came tumbling down. Volcanoes gave birth to dragons, and the monsters under the bed were made flesh. Fictional towns appeared from nowhere, populated with people who had decades worth of memories. The symbols of humankind's greatest ambitions and the fevered nightmares of it's most monstrous aberrations came to life all at once. All of human myth and fiction, all the gods and monsters spawned by the human imagination over the millennia of our existence came crawling from our minds and into the real world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things got interesting for a while.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
