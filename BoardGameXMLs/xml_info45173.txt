			<description>From the publisher &amp;quot;Vimary Burns is an adventure book that will radically change the face of the T8 world. Enraged by the actions of the warriors of the nation, the Houses of the Z'bri let loose a terrible vengeance on humanity, breaking free from the restraint that had been imposed upon them. Caught between the Tribes who rejected them and the beasts who are intent on destroying them, the Eighth Tribe must make a choice that will change their world forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vimary Burns tells the story of the Z'bri retribution against the islands of the Nation.

Two armies march upon a divided Nation and the Eighth Tribe may be their only hope for survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Six interwoven tales detailing the events leading up to, including and after the Burning of Vimary;&lt;br/&gt;    * Plenty of tips and advice for weaving the events of Vimary Burns into your current cycle;&lt;br/&gt;    * New NPCs and templates to be used with any Cycle;&lt;br/&gt;    * A look at the key agendas and conspiracies of the major players both within Vimary and beyond;&lt;br/&gt;    * And much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DP9-816, 64 pages&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
