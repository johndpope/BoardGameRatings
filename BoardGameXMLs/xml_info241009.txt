							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Time of Legends: Joan of Arc â€“ Ars Nova</name>
									
			<description>This new add-on contains Ars Nova, a contemplative and very replayable solo/co-operative scenario, set in an abbey where murder has been committed, and an investigation needs to be done. At least, that&amp;rsquo;s one side of it. The set also offers a group of new units, hex tiles, and interior overlays that you can use in your own scenarios or battle mode games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You get 18 monk miniatures in 6 different poses together with 4 multi-figure bases, and 6 stat cards. All of these monkish types are playable in the battle mode, as well as the Ars Nova scenario.&lt;br/&gt;You also get 7 unique, double-sided hex tiles, and 7 building interior overlays. The hex tiles can be mixed in with any others you may have to expand your options and size of playing area. The building interiors offer you some choices for existing buildings, changing the way some familiar types work. This means that you won&amp;rsquo;t always know what a building is until you enter it, adding a sense of exploration and mystery to even a simple battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, for the Ars Nova scenario itself, you get 1 Suspect sleeve, 8 Suspect cards, 20 Event cards, 80 Trial cards, 1 sand timer, and 30 tokens. &lt;br/&gt;Playing the scenario is straightforward. It uses the normal rules with some additional mini-games to represent the trials you have to go through to gather your evidence. &lt;br/&gt; Also worth noting is that this scenario includes no combat at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
