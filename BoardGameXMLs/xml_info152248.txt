			<description>The chef that makes the most dishes wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tabula Pasta is a game where the players are all chefs working at a small Italian restaurant. They are trying to out do each other by getting the most satisfied customers. Each customer's order is determined by rolling three special dice (meat, pasta, and sauce). The chefs must race against each other to fulfil the orders using the cards in their hand, the deck, and the pantry. The chef with the most satisfied customers by the end of the game is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board game is a table, set for four persons. To begin the game you place a meeple (patron) in each chair. Determine each patron's order by rolling their own set of special dice, one each of a sauce, meat, and pasta die. The players (chefs) then have to match the patron's order by drawing cards from the grocery delivery (deck) or the pantry (three piles of discarded cards, shared by everyone, that haven't been used to fill an order). Once an order has been filled the player shows everyone their match, moves the patron next to them to keep score, places the used cards in the bus bin (discard pile, you can never dig from the trash to complete an order, that's gross!), and finally seats a new patron (if any are left) and rolls a new order for them. Play continues until everyone has been served.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the six types of pasta, meat, and sauce cards there are also wild cards and secret ingredient cards (a pasta, meat, or sauce that counts as any other type, but you can only use one to fill an order). There are variations for faster games: using less patrons and/or removing the meat cards and dice (light lunch).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
