							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The King&#039;s Rings</name>
									
			<description>The King's Rings is a gambling and dexterity game. Players are thieves in a tavern, gambling with some of the treasure they captured from the King&amp;rsquo;s treasury. They first bid how many rings they think they can add to the Stack before it topples, then take turns placing one ring at a time. The last player to place the final ring of her bid before the Stack collapses gains points equal to her bid. The first thief to gain points equal to the goal will win The King&amp;rsquo;s Rings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created for the 2014 Nestorgames Rings contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
