			<description>(From National Geographic's Store Website):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Retrace the National Geographic expedition that first put American climbers on the summit of Earth's highest mountain: the Himalaya's 29,035-foot-high Mount Everest. In this exploration and strategy game, actual photos of Everest create the playing surface. Use Skill and Gear cards to ascend a photo-realistic 3-D mountain via routes used by the real climbers, including National Geographic Society photographer Barry C. Bishop. But watch out because hazards are everywhere and can cost you your shot at the summit! For 2 to 4 players or teams, Ages 8 and up. National Geographic map of Everest included. 14W x 19L x 11H.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
