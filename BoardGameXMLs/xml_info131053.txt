			<description>from the designer's announcement:&lt;br/&gt;This savage fan 40+ page PDF is a complete resource book for any Space Opera game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content Overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     5 hindrances&lt;br/&gt;     14 edges&lt;br/&gt;     An extensive equipment list&lt;br/&gt;     Various armors and shields&lt;br/&gt;     16 new weapons including blasters and disintegrators&lt;br/&gt;     Cyberware, from replacements to enhancements&lt;br/&gt;     A full rule set on how to create space ships as characters, complete with skills, edges, hindrances, and equipment&lt;br/&gt;     And finally a full featured adventure generator!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thank you for having an interest in this project of mine. At first I created this book as an material collection to use at my gaming table to play a space opera campaign. It was started by scouring all the available Sci Fi conversions for Savage Worlds I could find. There were bits and pieces I liked, but not a whole book I could simply take and use. I wanted some generic but iconic weapons, armors and equipment. Using them without their background required tweaking in some and a total rewrite of item descriptions in many cases. Soon I decicided to create  new &amp;ldquo;generic&amp;rdquo; material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During writing I had more ideas and started to write them down too. So it grew bit by bit. Savage Space took weeks to complete and everything went through several iterations and optimizations thanks to feedback I received. There are two sections I am incredibly proud of. One is the chapter and rules for Space Ships as Characters. They were the piece that originally drew the most attention and at the same time the most challenging to write in the first place. And on the other hand the Adventure Generator. That was a lot of fun to come up with, as I am a huge fan of those to fuel my creativity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hopefully I succeeded in staying &amp;ldquo;generic&amp;rdquo;, it was harder than I had originally thought. We all have our own preconceptions of a Sci Fi setting and they inadvertently creep into our writing. That is why I have included a one page description of my setting on the next page, so you get an idea what I think of when I say &amp;ldquo;Generic&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you plan any form of Sci Fi Campaign in Savage Worlds I heartily suggest you also have a look at the Savage Worlds Sci Fi Toolkits and the Daring Tales of the Space Lanes adventures from Triple Ace Games. The latter are not only interesting adventures, but they also contain lots of great rules and tools to create an awesome space opera campaign with a slightly pulpy note. I use them in addition to this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
