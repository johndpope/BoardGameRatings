							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sandwich City</name>
									
			<description>Sandwich City is a game where players compete to make the best and biggest (which isn't always the best) sandwiches in town, using resource tokens such as Chicken, Fish, Carrots, Pigs, Sheep and the extremely rare token... Bricks. (to create the sandwich that is aptly titled, &amp;quot;Man Up&amp;quot;.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also fierce market made up of high price city shops and low end deals from street vendors. As food items are bought, others become cheaper, allowing players to have full control over the fluctuations of the ever changing market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can make up to 52 different sandwiches, from &amp;quot;The Handout&amp;quot; (which is just a piece of chicken between two slices of bread) all the way to &amp;quot;The Kitchen Sink&amp;quot; (which is basically everything you can imagine).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will also manage their kitchen with a refrigerator, freezer and countertop. Items in the refrigerator get moldy over time, but the freezer lasts forever. Watch out though! Your opponent could sneak a &amp;quot;Freezer Fail&amp;quot; bonus up on you. It's very rare, but it's also very powerful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
