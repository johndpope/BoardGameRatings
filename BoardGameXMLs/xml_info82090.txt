							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Titany: to have more luck</name>
									
			<description>Rough translation of the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine that you find yourself on board the Titanic.  All the passengers are enjoying their first cruise on this unique luxury liners.  Suddenly, the ship rams an iceberg.  The alarms sound.  The ship begins to sink.  Now there's only one goal: to get to a lifeboat as quickly as possible!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Titany to have more luck&amp;quot; is a very nice racing game.  The challenge is to bring all of your own pawns cleverly, quickly, and safely from the various starting decks to the lifeboats.  The path to the lifeboats passes treacherously through passageways and elevators.  Despite this, each player tries to get his pawns to the most tactically advantageous positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But be careful!  Being together is often the same as being against each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have fun and ship ahoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a note in English on the box indicating that this game is dedicated to James Cameron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
