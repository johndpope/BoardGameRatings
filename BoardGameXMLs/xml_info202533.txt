			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intrepid Reslin Kine spent many of his years as an adventurer. A life of exploring ruins and fighting monsters garnered Reslin a modest reputation and a modest fortune, enough so that he could retire young from the dangerous career to live out the rest of his life on his plunder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, the rest of his life would come too soon. It was only a week after he learned his wife was with child that Reslin fell ill to the malady which would ultimately lead to his death. He&amp;rsquo;d be denied the chance at being a father, but he&amp;rsquo;d be damned if anyone could deny his son his inheritance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a party of 4 - 5 1st level characters.  The scenario is distributed in two versions - a standard (screen) version and a &amp;quot;printer-friendly (print) version without page backgrounds, etc.  The scenario is distributed as a ZIP archive that includes both PDF versions as well as several high-resolution PNG map images and a 3-page PDF print-and-play player's handout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
