							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battletech: Day of Heroes</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book: Almost 30 years ago the mercenary unit known as the Gray Death Legion discovered a long-forgotten Star League memory core, capturing the imagination of the entire Inner Sphere along the way. Since then, the famed unit has continued to blaze a trail of glory across the reaches of known space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now Day of Heroes, a new BattleTech campaign pack, lets you share in this legendary Legion's exploits as it slugs its way through three separate campaigns. Join the Gray Death's MechWarriors as they battle House Kurita's renowned First Ghost Regiment during the War of 3039. Share their agonizing defeates and hard-earned victories as they struggle against the savage might of Clan Jade Falcon on Sudeten and Pandora. Stand side by side with these brave men and women as the Second Skye Rebellion traps half the unit on Glengarry and forces a young Alexander Carlyle to lead them as they struggle for their lives against an overwhelming foe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Day of Heroes: The Continuing Adventures of the Gray Death Legion is a supplement for the BattleTech game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
