			<description>G.E.N.E.R.I.C is a basic 2D platforming game where the player must collect a certain amount of coins in order to proceed. The carious pick ups are coins, which have a base value of 1; bags which have a value of 5; and gems with a value of 12. The movement is WASD style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player also has a gun, aimed with the mouse, which shoots out in a straight line when fired and erases anything in its path. Anything in the game that becomes even partially erased is now a stationary object and cannot be collected, nor kill the player (in instances where the object were enemies or spikes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was self-developed under the name Hempuli and published under the name Reactor Products (though all work was done by one person, Hempuli).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
