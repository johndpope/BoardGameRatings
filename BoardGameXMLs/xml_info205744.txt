			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Schema presents a generic, universal mechanism to enable rapid character creation and resolve complex actions.  Although generic, the game is presented with a fantasy veneer of formatting and examples.  The mechanism is light-weight and fairly rapid to utilize.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses Fudge Dice during resolution.  Characters are created by drawing custom cards (provided as print-and-play components) with various traits and components on them.  Cards may be randomly distributed or deliberately selected.  Tracking statistics, such as health, is done with token pools.  The game uses an atypical play surface organization, more typically seen in collectible card game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
