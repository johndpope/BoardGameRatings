							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NeoExodus Chronicles: World of Exodus</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exodus boasts a long and turbulent history, from the rise of the Kaga and the defeat of the First Ones, to the Twilight War and the founding of the Imperial Alliance, to the present crisis that threatens to tear that alliance apart. Great heroes and terrible villains drove its march, though even in hindsight the two are not always easily separated; theirs were the titanic passions, the deep loves and hates, the burning obsessions and base treacheries, by which modern Exodus was forged and tempered. Modern Exodus is as uncertain and troubled a land as it has ever been. The great empires have all withdrawn from the Imperial Alliance and many appear on the brink of war. The Alliance itself seems poised to become a conquering power, forcing its member nations back into the fold by any means necessary. Several of the great houses, particular the Caneus Empire&amp;rsquo;s House Eland, are in total disarray; even as national wars brew, civil ones threaten to cut the belligerents to pieces. More than ever, the world of Exodus needs heroes&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
