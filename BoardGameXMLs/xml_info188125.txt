			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sea of Man is a story roleplaying game about whaling in the 18th century. Characters are sailors aboard a small whaling vessel, being squeezed out of work by the organized whaling fleets of the day. At sea, you lose all sense of time. Isolation is all consuming, as days bleed into weeks. As the crew begin to question their own sanity, the pointlessness of destruction turns their voyage into a dark tale, not unlike the books that inspired this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protocol is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters together into dramatic situations. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
