			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;While on a routine survey mission, the crew of the USS Sparon receives an urgent distress signal from the Star Fleet Museum at Memory Alpha. As the closest available ship, the Sparon is ordered to investigate an attempted break-in of one of the museum's storerooms. The investigation leads to the planet Daran V and a group of dissatisfied Star Fleet veterans who voice the opinion that much stronger measures should be taken against the Federation's enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decisive action is needed when the museum reports the successful theft of a mothballed battleship, the USS Juggernaut, a relic of the Romulan War. If this ship were fitted with modern warp engines and other equipment, it would be very potent vessel. The adventurers must find those responsible for the theft before the Juggernaut can be used against Star Fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book was originally bundled as part of a two book set with &amp;quot;The Romulan War&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two book module also included a separate book &amp;quot;The Romulan War&amp;quot;, fought between the United Federation of Planets and the Romulan Star Empire. Included are essays by Federation experts on the causes of the war, the major battles, and the political, social, and economic factors involved.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
