			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase Abandon is a narrative-based GM-less RPG that&amp;rsquo;s easy to set up and run with a minimum of prep time. Character creation is streamlined, taking only ten minutes from start to finish, letting you get right into the meat of the game. Character equipment, powers, and skills are all handled through the same system, making them easy to understand and implement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanics are all effects-based, allowing them to be adapted to any genre and play style. Players can spend resources to add setting details, allowing the campaign to fit the players&amp;rsquo; preferences no matter what they are. Narration duties shift naturally, with chip bidding allowing players to take control of the narrative and systems in place to ensure that all players get a chance to shape the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
