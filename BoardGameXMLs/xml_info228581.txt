			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Are You 勇者？ (Are You Yuusha?) is a fast-paced were-wolf card game by the Japanese doujin publisher ザキさん工房 released at the Game Market 2015 Autumn convention in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Japanese, 勇者 means 'Hero' so the game name can be translated as 'Are you a Hero?'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within 2 rounds only, the monster players must find and eliminate the Hero player to win, otherwise it's the Hero player win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is only 1 Hero player card, and there are 5 monster cards available. Each of them has different abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays roughly as the following:&lt;br/&gt;1) Each player draws a character card. The players can only check on this character card and must keep it face down so no other player can see who they are.&lt;br/&gt;2) Give two action cards to each player.&lt;br/&gt;3) Before the start of the game, in order all players but one will close their eyes so one can play their power if possible.&lt;br/&gt;4) Round 1 starts. All players discuss and try to figure out the other player's identity. It is of course okay to lie.&lt;br/&gt;5) When time is up or everyone decided, all players put forward one card face down. &lt;br/&gt;6) The players reveal at once who they are going to play their action card against. You can play a card on yourself.&lt;br/&gt;7) Depending on your character, you may reveal you identity and use your ability.&lt;br/&gt;8) All the players reveal their action card and proceed to resolution of their effects. Any player whose HP reaches 0 is KO and is out for the game. They cannot display their action cards not their character card and cannot take part in the discussion until the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;9) Without replenishing action cards, move proceed to Round 2 by repeating steps  4 to 8.&lt;br/&gt;10) The game ends. If the Hero player is still alive he wins. If he's dead the monster players win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Summary&lt;br/&gt;【Are you 勇者？とは】&lt;br/&gt;・３～４人で手軽に楽しめる人狼型ゲーム&lt;br/&gt;・魔王復活の２日後までに勇者役のプレイヤーを推理して攻撃だ！&lt;br/&gt;・勇者のＨＰを０にすることができればモンスターサイドの勝利！&lt;br/&gt;・推理するだけでなく、キャラクターとアクションカードの能力を駆使した両陣営の攻防がアツい！&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
