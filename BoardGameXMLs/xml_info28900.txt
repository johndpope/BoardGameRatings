			<description>As the year 1944 ends, the Allied Army dominated almost all of the Italian Peninsula, but in the North, the valley of the P&amp;oacute; river was still in German hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those German troops were either depleted or were being removed for other fronts, and with few replacements available; the Luftwaffe already did not dare to appear; the logistic situations were chaotic; the imminent defeat decreased the German&amp;acute;s Moral and the end was coming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the other side, the Allies were strengthened, receiving continuous reinforcements, the moral was high and the situation in Europe was changing. The end of war was a near reality, but when?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On September 12, 1944, the Allies launched an assault with its main objective as the city of Bologna, an important center of communications in the valley of the P&amp;oacute;. If Bologna fell, the Allies would advance to Austria, isolating the remainder of the German armies still in Italy. Blocking one of the roads was a set of hills, and between these hills, was Mount Castle, the main objective of the 1&amp;ordf; Division of Infantry of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 Large map - 6 11x17 sections (print-n-play also comes with 12 8.5x11 sections)&lt;br/&gt;9 Page Rules&lt;br/&gt;1 Tables Chart&lt;br/&gt;9 Page Historical Notes&lt;br/&gt;191 counters and 3 special counters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.riachuelogames.com.br/mc.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.riachuelogames.com.br/mc.htm&lt;/a&gt; (Portugese)&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.riachuelogames.com.br/english/mc2.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.riachuelogames.com.br/english/mc2.htm&lt;/a&gt; (English)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Print-n-Play version at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.wargamedownloads.com/item.php?item=570&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.wargamedownloads.com/item.php?item=570&lt;/a&gt; * * * Removed from sale 1/13/10&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
