			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore the Algo Solar System, where space opera meets high fantasy! This RPG became a classic with this blending of genres with an excellent storyline. Collects Phantasy Star I, II, and III.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PHANTASY STAR I&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Story&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tie time: Space Century 342. The palce: Camineet on Palma, one of the three planets in the Algol Solar system located deep in the Andomeda galaxy. Under the democratic rule of King Lassic, life was good as he provided everything his people could want. Space Travel had been discovered 200 years beofre and deep space shuttles had allowed colonization of Motavia and Dezoris, the other worlds of the Algol Solar System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But slowly, over time, things began to change. Dark priest of a new religion, never seen by any mortal, promised immortality to all who joined. You would live forever! King Lassic was getting old. The idea of living forever appealed to him so he became the first to join. Then, he... changed. The people began to suffer and horrible creatures and monsters began to stalk all three worlds. Lassic had become an evil tyrant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But where there is evil there is always good. Lassic's Robotcops were ruthless, ferreting out the do-gooders that meant to unseat him. One of those do-gooders was Nero. Long ago, his father had disappeared trying to learn Lassic's evil secrets. And finally the Robotcops caught up with Nero as well. Before he died, he passed on his short sword and his quest to his sister, Alis. He also told her to find a brave fighter named Odin. Alis raised the sword to the sky and vowed that Nero's death would not be in vain!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PHANTASY STAR II&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Story&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Somewhere drifting in space is the beautiful Algo Star System. Around the parent star, Algo, whirl its three children--Palm, Mota, and Dezo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the planets, Mota's history is the most troubled. From far in her past comes the legend of Alis, the courageous young woman who fiercely found--and succeeded--in ridding Mota of the evil oppressor Lassic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But now another tragedy oppresses Mota. This is one far worse than Lassic, being not a person, but an unknown evil! Everything is affected by it--the climate, the machinery, even nature! Strange vicious creatures infest the countrysides. They terrify and destroy! No longer does anyone venture outside a city--unless they don't want to return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What happened to Mother Brain, the controlling entity of Mota? Why have things gone so wrong? Who is smart enough to solve the riddle? And who is brave enough to save the planet?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PHANTASY STAR III&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Story&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today's your big day. You're marrying Maia, the mysterious woman you found on the shores of your father's kingdom. But as you and Maia walk up the aisle, a winged dragon grabs your bride and disappears...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the tragic start of what seems to be a never-ending journey into a world of loathsome creatures and wicked souls. Live through three generations in this epic adventure and find out what lies behind the realm of terror. Only you determine which of the four endings you'll experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the beginning you are Rhys. Gather information by talking to the people in Landen, where your father rules as king.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
