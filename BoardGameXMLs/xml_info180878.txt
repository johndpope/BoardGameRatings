Some goals could be trying to stick to an ideal path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenges are delivered in packs of 6. Each pack is labelled after a place on the globe: &amp;ldquo;Madrid&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Sahara&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Istanbul&amp;rdquo;. With the 3 packs included in game, you have 18 challenges to master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Days of Wonder website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
