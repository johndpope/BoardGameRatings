			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a full-color, 16 x 10 inch map of a Medieval Small House, and includes the VTT (Virtual Table top) files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;What do you need stranger? We have no room here for you to sleep. If you are here to steal my sheep you will feel the blade I have tempered to stab the wolves.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medieval Small House is a single map of the interior rooms and exterior of a medieval dwelling suitable for two people living there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medieval Small House is intended for fantasy or medieval historical settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for this product:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slaughtered Livestock: The group meets an ill-tempered shepherd who is angry that his sheep are disappearing at night. After calming him down, he invites the group to a fish dinner with his wife, a capable fisherwoman. He tells the group that his sheep are being slaughtered at night. Each morning, he finds one dead, full of bite and claw marks. He suspects a pack of wolves is responsible for the slaughtering of his sheep and will pay the group well for their pelts. He can offer payment in thick wool clothing, smoked fish, or forged weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group patrols the area and eventually finds a wolf pack to defeat and bring back their pelts. But when they return, they still find a sheep slaughtered that morning. The shepherd pays them and pleads for them to stay the night, keep watch on the sheep, and find out who is actually slaughtering his sheep. He suspects something larger now, like a bear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While watching the sheep, the group sees the farmer&amp;rsquo;s wife sleepwalking out of the house. Once the moonlight hits her, she turns into a werewolf, and attacks the group!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
