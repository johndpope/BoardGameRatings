							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Campaign Options: The Feat Reference Document</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything You Don't Already Have!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Feat Resource Document has over 700 feats from the publisher of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook! It's the ultimate compilation of feats that aren't in the online Resource Document, taken from more than 100 adventures, companions and campaign sourcebooks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All are in as close to their original format as possible with only those flavor changes required to make them 100% Open Game Content. Additionally, every feat has any word changes highlighted, so it's easy to determine if a feat has been modified in any way from the original published version, and all the needed rules sub-sets are included (so if you take Dragoncrafting, or Deific Obedience, all the rules needed to use those feats are in the Appendix).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So stop flipping through scores of splatbooks looking for exactly what you need to make a villain memorable, tie a hero to his homeland, or properly use a dwarven chain-flail. Instead, get everything you need in The Feat Reference Document! It's the ultimate Pathfinder-compatible companion rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
