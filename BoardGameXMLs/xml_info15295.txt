			<description>This is a childrens memory game with a Mickey Mouse theme. In the basic game, each player takes a board with 6 shapes of various colors on it. On a turn, you draw a tile from the centerboard and look at it. If it matches the color and shape of a space on your gameboard, you place it on the empty board space. To win, be the first player to fill your 6 spaces with matching tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the advanced game, players use the reverse sides of their boards. Each board depicts a different land at Disney World. Play is the same for the basic game, but you must match the pictures on the tokens to the corresponding Disney ride depicted on your 6 board spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
