			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CatChum is a clone of Pac-Man written for the CP/M OS.  It was shipped with the KayPro II line of computers.  As the KayPro II had no graphics capabilities, the game was implemented using text only.  The 'Pacman' eqivalent in the game, for example, was the letter 'C', alternating rapidly between upper and lower case to give the impression of chomping pellets (represented by periods).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
