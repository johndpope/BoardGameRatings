							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">China Doll: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>China Doll is an action game based on the short film &amp;lsquo;China Doll&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br/&gt;Choose between four mafia families from New York City&amp;rsquo;s Chinatown and Little Italy battle to take over the sacred Xin-Lu sword and slaughter other player&amp;rsquo;s family members.&lt;br/&gt;The game is composed of the following cards:&lt;br/&gt;Family, Character, Action, Immediate and one Xin-Lu Sword Card.&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the game is to posses the Xin-Lu Sword card, fighting for it and/or stealing it.&lt;br/&gt;The player who has the Xin-Lu sword and kills all other player&amp;rsquo;s family members is the winner. If a player has the Xin-Lu sword and all his or her family members are killed, he or she also wins (because no-one else will ever find it).&lt;br/&gt;So whether you kill everyone or everyone kills you, as long as you have the sword, you win.&lt;br/&gt;You may play up to 3 cards during each turn. It is recommendable to play at least 1 character card to defend your self against attacks. Character cards have 3 different numbers (red, green and white) that will determine their value depending on who they are fighting against. You may only use characters that belong to your family.&lt;br/&gt;This game is ideally played with 2 to 3 players (specially 3 players), but can also be played with 4 to 5 players if two decks are mixed together and used.&lt;br/&gt;Visit &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.chinadollthemovie.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.chinadollthemovie.com&lt;/a&gt; for more info.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
