			<description>The second game in the series, TrackMania Sunrise, features more realistic graphics and contains three environments: Island, Bay, and Coast. As in the original game, each has a unique car to fit the environment's characteristics. &amp;quot;Island&amp;quot; features fast sports cars which can turn sharply on mostly wide roads while &amp;quot;Bay&amp;quot; has bouncy cars with less traction, making accidental oversteering more likely. &amp;quot;Coast&amp;quot; features slower cars with little traction and small roads where cars are able to drift through corners. The game was built on an overhauled engine for better visuals and Internet connectivity with tracks that include skinnable advertisement panels. This version also features two new gameplay modes: Platform gives players a start and finish point with mandatory checkpoints and restart points in between while Crazy returns to the race course, but this time pits the player against ghosts, each of which has a faster time than the last.&lt;br/&gt;Some of TrackMania Sunrise other enhancements were later added to the Original edition of the game. These include the ability to import new car models and customize many more aspects of the game. &amp;quot;Sunrise&amp;quot; features improved Internet connectivity and implements a peer-to-peer system allowing players to share car models, skins, and more. The new track editor primarily uses the mouse as opposed to the keyboard-driven original, and makes possible special effects like displaying text and changing the camera angle using Media Tracker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;TrackMania&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
