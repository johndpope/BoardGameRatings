			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At last ... &amp;quot;it has happened&amp;quot; ... as a result of a sneak attack, Aliens have taken the Straits of Hormuz and have captured the essential Military bases and naval shipping with the full intention of crippling the world's oil supplies. In the face of this Alien aggression the ability of the United States naval air force is in question. You must now take part in &amp;quot;Operation Hormuz&amp;quot; to show the strength and determination of the US carrier forces to respond to land launched rocket attacks that are now wiping out international shipping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will be flying a McDonald Douglas VTOL ground attack derivative of the BA Harrier used so effectively in the Falkland War. Weapon systems will include cannon, bombs, heat-seeking air-to-air and air-to-ship missiles; with flares for your own protection against enemy heat-seeking missiles. You will fly over hostile enemy shipping, heavily protected by MIG 21 fighters, before engaging the first rocket base, where the silos can only be destroyed by accurate dive bombing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will then rendezvous with your carrier in hostile water, to re-fuel and re-arm before proceeding with the next six bases further along the gulf. In addition to your aggressive role, you must intercept all incoming anti-ship missiles aimed at your carrier. Your initial squadron will be of three planes, though one of these will be lost from your carrier each time you fail to intercept an incoming anti-ship missile. In contrast to this, extra planes will be added to your squadron depending on the accuracy and aggression of your own attacks. Your carrier will finally be sunk by a missile that hits it after all the planes on it have been lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack the most lightly defended base first! - Can you destroy all seven bases without the loss of your carrier? It all depends on you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Operation Hormuz&amp;quot; was re-released in North America under the name &amp;quot;Harrier 7&amp;quot; dropping the pretence that you are flying a 'derivative' of the Harrier and making reference to the seven bases which must be destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
