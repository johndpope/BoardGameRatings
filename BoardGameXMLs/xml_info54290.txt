			<description>Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sword of the Dales, an icon of the Dalelands symbolizing the unity and strength of the people, has reappeared! Created by Shraevyn the weapons-mage hundreds of years ago, the lost sword had become nothing more than a fantastic childrens tale - until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of warriors led by Randal Morn, rightful ruler of Daggerdale, rushed to the swords resting place to recover it, but dark forces awaited them, and Randal and his men fell to an ambush. Only one man escaped, yet he brought with him the hope that Randal Morn yet lives. Resolved to rescue his leader, that lone survivor turned to the great Elminster of Shadowdale for aid. But Elminster is gone, off plane-hopping while the fate of Daggerdale hangs in the balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hence, it is up to Lhaeo, scribe to the old mage, to find a group of heroes who have mettle enough to face down the menace which claimed Randal Morn and his hearty followers...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
