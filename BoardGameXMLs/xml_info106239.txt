			<description>Solvalou (ソルバルウ, Sorubarū?) is a shoot 'em up arcade game that was released by Namco in 1991. It is the 3rd title in the Xevious series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solvalou is the name of the ship that the player controls in all five games, including the later Xevious 3D/G and Xevious Arrangement. Solvalou is also borrowed as a fictional company brand in the 4th Ridge Racer game, for an elite Italian racing team who race in distinct silver and navy blue livery. It later appeared in Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection as Jack 5's customizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was released for the Nintendo's Virtual Console service in Japan on March 26, 2009, and is one of the first Virtual Console titles to make use of the Wii Remote's pointer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is very much like Xevious and Super Xevious except that the game is in 3D and has a 1st-person viewpoint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Solvalou&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
