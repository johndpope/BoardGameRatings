			<description>Universal Games was heavily inspired by the 3M bookcase style in the physical production of their games, and  Merger was also inspired by one of their actual games, as it is clearly a linear takeoff of Acquire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Merger players move around a track and may start manufacturing cars at one of 6 plants by landing on it.  Landing next to a car lets you build another one (at a fixed cost).  Players can buy and sell stock in the 6 companies - the value goes up with the number of cars produced.  When two lines of cars meet the companies merge, with the larger taking over and the smaller having its stock cashed out.  The game ends when 3 companies have been merged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
