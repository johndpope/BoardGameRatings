			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Axioms is Autarch's quarterly supplement for the Adventurer Conqueror King System. Each issue of Axioms offers a mix of short content updates for ACKS, such as new classes, new sub-mechanical systems, explorations of specific themes within the game, short adventure scenarios, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue is a special edition, published in between our 3rd and 4th issue, to thank all of our ACKS fans by giving them more content!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The articles in the Special Edition issue are dedicated to long-term campaign play, with rules that provide a structure with which campaign activities each month can be handled as systematically as ACKS handles actions every combat round and exploration every turn. They cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Divine Activities: everything you need to know about acquiring and using divine power in campaign play&lt;br/&gt;    Domain Activities: mechanics for administering domains, inspecting troops, and more in campaign play&lt;br/&gt;    Magical Activites: everything you need to know about researching and crafting spell&lt;br/&gt;    Mercantile Activities: new-fangled rules for seeking profit the old-fashioned way in campaign play &lt;br/&gt;    Professional Activities: mechanics for crafting, training, and other specialized labor in campaign play &lt;br/&gt;    Syndicate Activities: mechanics for making crime pay and punishment go away in campaign play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While designed for use with ACKS, content in Axioms is compatible with any d20-based fantasy RPG built on the OGL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Axioms is made possible through the support of our patrons, who receive early access to the articles on a month-by-month basis.
