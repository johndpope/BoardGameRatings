							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zero Out</name>
									
			<description>The learner will be able to recognize and combine algebraic-like terms into sets of three. Each set will &amp;quot;zero out&amp;quot; (have a net value of zero).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players sort their cards by types of terms. They position cards of like terms together. Players take turns drawing the top card from the remaining deck or selecting the top card in the discard pile. During each turn, a player must draw from either pile and discard one card before their turn is over. Each player tries to make two sets of three cards. Each set must contain cards of like terms that &amp;quot;zero out.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who successfully goes out, gets a score of zero. The other players will add the absolute values of the coefficients of the terms in their hands to determine their score. The player with the lowest total at the end of a set number of rounds, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;86 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
