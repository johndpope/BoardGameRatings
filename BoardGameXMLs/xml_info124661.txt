			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Writers occupy a myriad of roles within any society. Some chronicle historical events, ensuring the preservation of a common legacy for future generations. Religious leaders record their patron deity&amp;rsquo;s deeds, dogmas and traditions, proselytizing converts through the recitation of their god&amp;rsquo;s words and actions. Civil authorities draft codes of law, establishing organized rules governing itself and its citizens. Wizards channel arcane energy onto the page, converting its mystical power into words. Professional writers entertain, educate and inspire others through a variety of diverse and unique mediums. Regardless of their motivations, the ideas expressed by writers influence society more than any other force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In that vein, this supplement endeavors to provide players the opportunity to expand their characters&amp;rsquo; horizons and abilities, not just by the might of the sword or the power of magic, but through the force of words. By mastering the nuances of language and sound, characters embark on a unique journey, attaining fame and wealth through creative ingenuity in addition to traditional adventuring skills. Of course, might and magic share the spotlight as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ink &amp;amp; Quill presents a number of diverse abilities, classes and items allowing characters to attain this goal. A host of new feats specializing on the use of language and sound supplement the arsenal of any character, regardless of her previous background. In addition, skills such as Decipher Script, Profession and Perform undergo a startling transformation, while the Knowledge skill expands dramatically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
