			<description>Two player ice hockey game, authorized to use the official 1974 Ice Hockey World Championship Tournament Emblems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player selects a national team, the teams are identical - only names and picture vary. The players are set in a rink and then players alter turns to play action card (such as attack, shot, save, off side etc) from their hand and try to achieve a position where they can score. Only one card per turn can be played, a new card is drawn after the played card is resolved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea is to score goals and win the match. When the deck runs out, the period is over. After the third period is over, the match ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules say that the maximum players is six, but that is only for tournaments - only two players can play at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
