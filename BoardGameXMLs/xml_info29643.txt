							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Whist-O</name>
									
			<description>This Bingo variant incorporates elements of the card game Whist.  At the start of the game, a standard playing card deck is dealt out evenly into stacks in front of all of the players.  Each player is given a board showing all of the values in all of the suits.  Every turn, starting with the dealer, players ante into the pot and turn up the top cards of their stacks.  The player with the highest-ranked card wins the trick and gets to put a chip on their board in the corresponding space.  Losers all have to put chips into the pot.  The first player to get five consecutive values in a single suit (a vertical row) or four suits in a single value (a horizontal row) calls Whist-O and wins the pot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 12 boards and a bag of red plastic chips, but playing cards are not provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
