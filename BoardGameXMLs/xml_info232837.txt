			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of disparate heroes have been brought together to decide the fate of the city of Neverwinter. This is a tale of battle and intrigue. The heroes must learn who they can trust as they stir events that will bring the city to a turning point. Who is the new Lord Protector of Neverwinter? Are the tales of deception, corruption, and assassination true? As for the rebels that toil against the Lord Protector, who is their leader, she who seems to have entered the stage from nowhere? Only the heroes, caught in this roiling sea of masked truths, can put things to rest in Neverwinter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mirrored Thrones consists of four adventures, which can be played through sequentially or used as one-shots. Each adventure is scaled for a different level of player character: the first adventure is for 1st-level characters, the second for 3rd-level, the third for 7th-level, and the fourth for 11th level. Each adventure takes approximately 3 to 5 hours to complete. The adventures feature different styles of play, from a standard dungeon crawl to an open-ended infiltration of an enemy base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
