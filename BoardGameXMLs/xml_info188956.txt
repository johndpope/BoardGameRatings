			<description>Dungeon Hack: Dungeon Adventure is the ultimate dungeon crawl! It combines true elements of D&amp;amp;D table top roleplaying using ver3.5 Dungeons and Dragons rules with a versatility of a card game dungeon crawl. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever played the original computer version of Dungeon Hack and loved the endless possibilities, then this is the game for you. It allows for solo or CO-OP play within a randomly generated multi-level dungeon. Just like in the computer game, you explore a never ending dungeon with monsters, treasure, traps, and glory! It&amp;rsquo;s you against the dungeon and everyone is out to get you! Dungeon Hack uses actual monsters, traps, treasures and equipment directly from the Dungeon and Dragons universe. Story lines and game play is taken from actual D&amp;amp;D modules! If you&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to play D&amp;amp;D but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the group, well look no further&amp;hellip; Dungeon Hack is here! You create actual characters with abilities that you will use during your adventure. All the while you earn experience and fortunes to help level up and grow your character to much stronger and higher levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Hack: Dungeon Adventure is a solo D&amp;amp;D game on a micro level using 4&amp;rdquo;x4&amp;rdquo; tile cards representing dungeon rooms, corridor rooms, corridors and junctions while colored cubes represent your characters and the ever increasing monsters. A multitude of cards depict and define the monsters, treasures, encounters, and obstacles you will face within the dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most D&amp;amp;D rules apply, with many of the mundane and complicated rules left out to create a smoother and more stream lined game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to descend each level facing new encounters that will bring you face to face with puzzles, doors, traps, monsters and treasures at every turn. Before every two levels you will have a QUEST card that depicts special requests for the town asking for specific items you can find during your adventures through the levels of the dungeon. If you find or collect all of the items on the QUEST card you receive the stated reward from the town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each level of the dungeon you descend will end up providing your character with a level of experience; if you survive to the lowest level of the dungeon, you will have reached the level of hero to be able to challenge the Big Boss!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you descend deeper into the dungeon you will encounter stronger and more dangerous monsters. When you reach the lowest level you will finally come face to face with the Big Boss of the dungeon which could be a dragon, a demon, etc&amp;hellip; basically the challenge of your life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survive the dungeon, make it out alive, and you will become the dungeon master! You&amp;rsquo;re victory score will be based on the level you reach &amp;ldquo;experience points&amp;rdquo;, the gold pieces you&amp;rsquo;ve earned &amp;ldquo;total gp&amp;rdquo;, the treasure you&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated &amp;ldquo;gp value&amp;rdquo;, and the monsters you&amp;rsquo;ve killed &amp;ldquo;total monsters destroyed&amp;rdquo;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
