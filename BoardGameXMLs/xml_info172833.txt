							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Universal Adventures Adventure Module #1: Assault on the Underworld</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something dreadful has come to Ravenor. People have begun disappearing. Packs of giant, vicious rats roam the streets, attacking people and animals and ravaging the contents of warehouses. Fishing boats have been found drifting unmanned through the morning mist, their crews never to be seen again. And there are rumors of strange sounds and smells plaguing the night and bodies drained of blood being found lying on the streets with the coming dawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Universal Adventures Assault on the Underworld!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Universal Adventures Assault on the Underworld is the first in a new series of Adventure Modules from New Realms Publishing. The module includes introductory and setup information, an Adventure Record with background, start and objective information, 9 Adventure cards, 9 Encounter cards, 9 Event cards, 9 Search cards, 18 Treasure cards and 9 Rubble Hall cards. Suitable for use with any fantasy role playing game, Assault on the Underworld can be played solo or with a group, with or without a GM. The adventure is highly re-playable and compatible with other Universal Adventures cards. In addition, you can combine the cards with other cards from the series, or cards from other Universal Adventures products, to create your own adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have never played an adventure like this before. Assault on the Underworld is not a random dungeon generator, or even part of one. The Adventure Module is a new, simple way to play fantasy adventures. The organization and presentation of the adventures allows for quick setup, quick play and gives you the ability to focus on the action and &amp;ldquo;story&amp;rdquo; while leaving you the option to include tactical action and combat if you desire. Enter a new and exciting world of adventure, full of wonder and surprises. Gather your heroes and prepare to undertake an Assault on the Underworld.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
