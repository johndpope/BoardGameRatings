			<description>Live the adventure of the Seigneurs in New France.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game of SEIGNEURIES is based on a true historical situation, i.e. the difficulties French faced when settling in Canada. Prior knowledge of the historical context of the game is not necessary in order to play. In playing the game, you may arrive at a situation which is not in strict&lt;br/&gt;accordance with History, however the game should certainly give you a lot of enjoyment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECT OF THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;The game consists in populating a Seigneurie, and in building the components of a village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of the game is the first to complete a Seigneurie with 31 censitaires, 1 mill, 1 church, 1 school, 4 roads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While turning around the board, you encounter squares which make you harvest, trade, feed you people, tax you population and acquire buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
