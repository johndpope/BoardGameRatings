			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You wake up hazily from what feels like a rather deep rest. Your eyes take time to adjust but as you slowly get up, you feel the ground for the first time... it feels strangely perfect&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Beastlands is a plane of primal wilderness, its a place of intelligent celestial beasts and of the most perfect nature to exist anywhere in the multiverse. Its the space between neutral good and chaotic good, and very few ever see it in their lifetimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the players accidentally stumble across a one-way portal to this plane however, they discover that its much harder and taxing to find a way out. There only hope it seems, is the advice of a friendly petitioner named Reith who's willing to help them find a way back to the material plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 1st - 2nd level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
