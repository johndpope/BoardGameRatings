							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dust Tactics: Terrain Tile Set</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dust Tactics: Terrain Tile Set includes twelve double-sided terrain tiles (and more!) to expand your Dust Tactics map library. These exciting components feature snow, warehouse, water, and bridge locations on which your Dust Tactics troops can wage their war. The Dust Tactics: Terrain Tile Set also includes the Operation: Blue Thunder campaign book found in the original Core Set. There are eight scenarios featured in the campaign book as well as three bonus scenarios to play on massive maps that are twelve tiles large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion allows new Dust Tactics players to experience the scenarios available in the original Dust Tactics Core Set. Players who own the original Dust Tactics Core Set will be able to expand their experience with the additional locations found on these terrain tiles and the three bonus scenarios. Further, the included double-sided structure tiles allow your forces to battle in an urban environment, recently an experience only available through Operation &amp;quot;SeeL&amp;ouml;we&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
