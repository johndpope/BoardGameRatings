			<description>A baseball game that encourages people to smoke whilst playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a game that you play with a lit cigarette. It has pieces of paper on which you guess if the play will be a single, double, triple or out. When the center of the paper that has a baseball field printed on it is touched with a lit cigarette the paper burns and I assume somehow t is an indicator of whether the play is an out, single, double or triple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fact that one or two of these games have survived is a miracle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
