							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Seventh Rule</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is comprised of 52 cards with rules printed directly on the cards.  One card always starts a game.  Play then proceeds in rounds with players attempting to create new rules for their character (the concept of character within the game is fairly thin).  As rules are formed, the game play changes to conform.  The player who sets The Seventh Rule is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are described as text; potential players must, however, format, create, and print their own decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
