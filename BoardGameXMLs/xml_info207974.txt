			<description>Play House is a card game in which players place rooms of a house and place items and people in each room. The objective is to be the first player to play all of your cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Items can only be played in the room in which they belong; for example, the Cookie Jar can only be played in the kitchen. People cards lock a room so that no other objects can be played in the room until the room is unlocked by a Key card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
