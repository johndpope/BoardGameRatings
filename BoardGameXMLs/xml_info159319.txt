							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City of Filbar</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The jewel of the Duchy, the great city of Filbar can be utilized as a home base for adventurers or as a goal to go see. This city has over 130 points of interest and is the home to the Duke of Filbar. Rumor has it that if you can't find it in Filbar, it can't be found anywhere...short of artifacts that is! The walled city has decorative fountains and artisans of every kind. Mages can visit the towers of magic and multiple potion shops. The grand courtyard south of the castle is the home of festivals and carnivals every month. All in all, this city is large enough to provide residence or adventure to almost every adventurer. At 49 pages long there is plenty to explore!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
