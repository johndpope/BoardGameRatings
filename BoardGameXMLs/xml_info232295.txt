			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the legacy of Asterion the Tyrant, seven islands struggle for unity- The Seven Principalities!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Seven Principalities were once eight islands, inhabited by the aboriginal lizardfolk, crablike kanseeran, and avian partatingi- and settled by the magically decadent erkunae and omnipresent humans. Then Asterion the Tyrant appeared, sunk one of the islands, and ruled as despot for decades&amp;hellip; And now the islands are separately ruled and extremely fractious and self-interested- can player characters turn this conflict into profit, and plunder ancient sites of forgotten magic and gold?  Heroes of the Seven Principalities continues the series of gazetteers looking at a new exciting nation of the Patchwork Planet of Porphyra!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New from Aaron Hollingsworth and Perry Fehr, and published by Purple Duck Games, the new Heroes of the Seven Principalities contains a trove of great material for your campaign settings and tabletop roleplaying game.
