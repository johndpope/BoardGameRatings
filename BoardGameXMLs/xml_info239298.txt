							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Beast of Broly</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A string of graphic murders have occurred in the quite mining town of Broly, shaking the idyllic town to it's core. The founder of the town, the affluent Arthur Broly, is on his death bed. Are these gruesome crimes part of an inheritance struggle, or is something more sinister happening behind the scenes? The players take the roles of detectives, agents, and investigators from various law enforcement agencies, that don't like to cooperate, but have no choice if they want to figure out the truth behind The Beast of Broly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This intense murder mystery takes place over the course of a week, in which the players must find out what is truly happening in the town of Broly before it is too late. A rich cast of NPCs, each with their own motives and agendas, are provided to help the game-master guide the adventure along no matter what course of action the players take.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
