			<description>Cartouche Dynasties is a kingdom-building card game with worker placement elements for two players. Each player heads a fledgling dynasty in Upper and Lower Egypt, hoping to leave their mark as the greatest dynasty. Players take turns exalting the gods of ancient Egypt to acquire new cards or play the cards they already have &amp;mdash; or sometimes both! Players score points for the cards in their kingdom, as well as cards they have stored away as scrolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cartouche Dynasties is played over a series of ages (i.e., rounds). Each age, players take turns selecting and playing God cards to the four decks to acquire or play cards. At the end of the game, players earn points for the cards in their kingdom and the cards in their scrolls. The player with the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
