			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Into the dark is the third part of a series of solitaire games that use a very simple core concept &amp;ndash; travelling from point a to point b &amp;ndash; to explore 3dimensional spaces in which those journeys take place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After &amp;quot;layers behind each other&amp;quot; (into the woods) and &amp;quot;holes on top of each other&amp;quot; (Infiltrate: into the bear cave) now the shadows cast by 3dimensional scenery influence the movement possibilities on the board. &lt;br/&gt;Therefore the game that has to be played by the light of a single candle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;what it is about: &lt;br/&gt;In this game you will enter a strange land to find a certain secret site and hopefully return to the exit. &lt;br/&gt;To find out where this site is, you will have to venture &amp;quot;into the dark&amp;quot; - which in this game is the bottom of the board. &lt;br/&gt;Here you can find information about the possible secret sites to visit and how that strange land will react to you entering them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart from you there is one local inhabitant roaming the land. &lt;br/&gt;It will try to reach you. If it does the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How it works: &lt;br/&gt;The land is a landscape of dark (shadow) and light (no shadow) spaces. &lt;br/&gt;You can move freely as long as you do not use a dark connection (dotted line between spaces in shadow) or enter a dark space. &lt;br/&gt;In the last case you would become scared and have to add a despair cube to your cup of action cubes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These cubes are drawn during the game and placed onto an action display. &lt;br/&gt;9 cubes arranged into 3 by 3 grid define what might happen:&lt;br/&gt;Each round you will choose one column or row of cubes in that display. The cubes chosen will define whose turn it is: Yours (white cube), a tower&amp;acute;s (yellow cube) or the Inhabitant&amp;acute;s (black cube). &lt;br/&gt;In your turns you can either move from light space to light space or modify the board by pushing towers to the left or right. &lt;br/&gt;This will change the distribution of shadows on the board an through that your movement possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 x 6 &amp;quot;end game rule tokens&amp;quot; provide 216  possible different end game scenarios you will have to prepare for in the first half of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
