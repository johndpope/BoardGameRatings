			<description>Skirmish Wargame Rules 1900-1939&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Triumph and Tragedy is a set of wargame rules that allows for both straigth historical games as well as those with a cinematic, more adventurous approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can re-enact conflicts in settings as diverse as Russia, China, India, Darkest Africa an many more.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player has a card for every squad or vehicle, cards are piled in secret order and turned over one every turn. Turning up the card and revealing the unit that will act this turn is a contemporary action of the players. With each unit card revealed is turned up an action card that describes what the unit will actually do during the turn. There are 8 different actions possible that vary from easy things like shooting or moving to more elaborated or special actions like the ones esecuted by squad leaders and heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every unit has a fixed &amp;quot;score&amp;quot; that is used to accomplish everything and it's based on the experience level of the unit itself. It is necessary to roll and beat that score to successfully accomplish the task, so the more experienced a unit is, the lower the score will be. An array of situational modifiers are provided. Tests are made usually with a d10, but morale and other special tests can requiere using 2d6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are included too for campaign gaming, artillery, air support and personalization of special characters and heroes on the game table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
