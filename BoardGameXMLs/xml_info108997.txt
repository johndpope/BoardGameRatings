							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War Planes A Card Game for Aircraft Spotters</name>
									
			<description>A box of Second World War aircraft identification cards titled 'War Planes - A Card Game for Aircraft Spotters'. The game was a Quartet game but with the unusual difference that the sets were not equal. The thrifty government, at the outbreak of war, ensured that players could also use the cards for regular card games by taking out the extra suit of 13 cards.&lt;br/&gt;The pack comprises of 67 cards organised as follows:&lt;br/&gt;65 illustrated cards representing five different views each of thirteen British and German aircraft, and two 'Key' cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was intended that Spotters, at airfields or on the roofs of London buildings, could practice recognising aircraft to improve their skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
