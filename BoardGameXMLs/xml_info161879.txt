							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Keeper Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Pits heroes and villains from classic novels against one another in a race to collect the Books of Power, and a battle for all mankind.  In The Keeper Board Game you can join forces with Shay, his girlfriend Becky, Grandfather Nolan, or a cast of heroes from classic novels such as Peter Pan and Pinocchio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OR&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Work with the Master and his cast of the world's most infamous villains in a race to the Books of Power. When a book is collected you unlock one of the characters from that book to use in part two. Good unlocks good. Evil unlocks evil. For example if Shay were to reach the novel Dracula first he'd unlock Van Helsing! If the Master were to reach Dracula first he'd unlock Dracula. Once all of the books are collected, and their characters unlocked, part two begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Careful there are skirmishes along the way that may set you back! Play a Battle Point Card, and draw your enemy into battle. Loser loses a turn. Winner gets an extra chance to draw an unlock-able card. Weapons and characters are hidden within the deck. A chance at unlocking them makes drawing from the deck even more exciting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In part two you take all of your unlocked characters and battle by rolling dice. Last man/woman/team standing wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
