							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mexican War</name>
									
			<description>The Mexican War is a simple, card-driven game of the war between Mexico and the United States that was fought from 1846 to 1848. It is a two-player game in which one player plays the military forces of the United States, and the other plays the forces of Mexico. The U.S. player attempts to conquer Mexican territory and to compel Mexico to surrender, while the Mexican player attempts to avoid this outcome long enough for public war-weariness and regional divisions to compel the U.S. withdraw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prominent military leaders, army strength points, U.S. naval forces, and political concerns and conditions are all represented. Historically, although many contemporary foreign observers thought that Mexico had the advantage, the war was one of the most one-sided victories in U.S. military history. This game allows players not only to explore what conditions contributed to this outcome, but also whether the Mexicans might have been able to achieve victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Played on an authentic 19th-century map of Mexico, Mexican War includes both introductory and standard rules. Based on the rules system of the popular introductory game We The People, it is ideal for introducing youngsters and new players to the hobby, yet substantial enough to attract the veteran gamer. Complexity is low for the Basic Rules to moderate for the Standard Rules (about 2/10 to 3.5/10 respectively).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
