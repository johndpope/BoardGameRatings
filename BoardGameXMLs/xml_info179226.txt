			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four rival powers go from planet to planet on different quests for victory.   For some it is collecting artifacts while for others it is complete extirpation of the rival team.   It can be played two against two or as a free-for-all.   There are more boardgame-oriented modes as well as modes that include fog of war and neutral combatants.   With resources obtained on conquered planet you can build new ships of various types, remembering that there is a large asymmetry in speed of building and ship power.  As well there are cards that can be turned in for resources or played for special battle or random actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
