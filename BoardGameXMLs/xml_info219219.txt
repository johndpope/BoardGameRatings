			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Kickstarted creation. The second by Scolopendra Games Creator Joseph Pendergast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules of play:&lt;br/&gt;Each person gets a player strip and the cards are placed face down on the table. If you do not have enough strips for all the players just remember to stop at 6 cards. Take turns flipping cards onto your player strips in turn.&lt;br/&gt;Squirrel cards clear your line and you get no points.&lt;br/&gt;Hawk cards clear all lines and no points are collected.&lt;br/&gt;White raven cards are wild and the suggested use is to double the score of a line but, it is up to you.&lt;br/&gt;Once you have successfully filled a line with cards you may choose to keep your score by counting the number of birds up and adding them to what you already have acquired or if any blank cards are present you may try to gain more points by waiting to cover them a turn at a time until you desire to stay with what you have. After a line is successfully cleared draw a new card and play resumes. If a hawk or squirrel clears your line you do not pick up a new card.&lt;br/&gt;Place all used birds in a face-up discard pile.  You may not draw from this discard pile. When you run out of cards shuffle the discard and continue play.&lt;br/&gt;Once the agreed upon score is reached by any player either that player wins after all other players finish their turns or all other players have a chance to overcome the winner before the deck runs out.&lt;br/&gt;This rule card may be used as an optional 4 bird card.&lt;br/&gt;For a quick single player game, try to make it to 30 points in one round through the deck.&lt;br/&gt;The number of points you choose to go to decides how long gameplay will be I generally play to 30 but some people will play to 1000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
