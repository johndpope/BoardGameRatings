							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Royal Cup: Firemaker</name>
									
			<description>This is the adult, NSFW version of Royal Cup: Icebreaker-- a social card game for parties designed to help people of all walks of life come out of their shells, break out of their comfort zones, let loose and break the metaphorical ice. Royal Cup: Firemaker is for ages 17 and up, is like King's Cup on steroids without actually being a drinking game. The game's premise is not about drinking, rather about making you get to know your friends on a level you never knew them before or by getting to know complete strangers on a personal, intimate, and human level by asking the right (and wrong) questions. Every aspect of the game was designed with one overarching question in mind: does this help break the ice? It's primarily designed to help shy, reserved and introverted people socialize, laugh their socks off, and have a great time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
