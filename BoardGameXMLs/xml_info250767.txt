							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game – The Withered Heath</name>
									
			<description>The Withered Heath is the first Adventure Pack in the Ered Mithrin cycle for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game. After journeying up the Anduin River on the eve of winter, braving the Forest Road through Mirkwood, and plumbing the depths of the caves that lie below the Iron Hills, word of a new threat waiting high in the Grey Mountains has reached your group of heroes. This dire pronouncement has sent them in search of the Withered Heath, a long valley where Dragons are said to breed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With its sixty cards (including a new hero and three copies of each new player card), The Withered Heath finds you and your heroes desperately seeking to extinguish this danger before it can direct its wrath to the whole of the Wilderland. But the road through the mountains is treacherous, the weather being just as dangerous as any of the creatures you might encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
