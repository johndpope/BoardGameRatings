							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hot Dog Hooligans</name>
									
			<description>This game comes from that lovable crew that brought you Pirates Versus Ninjas.  This game however, has neither Pirates nor Ninjas.  It involves a hot dog eating contest where the contestants are the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rounds begin with the first player flipping over a hot dog to attempt to eat.  The hot dog has stats that match the five tastes (sweet, sour, spicy, salty, bitter).  Play proceeds to the left with the next player playing a topping card on the hot dog to attempt to make the first player lose their lunch.  Toppings include everything from lemons to fish heads.  Play proceeds until all of the opponents have had a chance to play a topping or pass.  Then the initial player has a chance to play negative toppings such as pepto or antacid to make the hot dog edible.  If they can't (the hot dog has a higher level than the character in at least one state), they lose their lunch.  Play proceeds to the next player who then flips over a hot dog to eat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until a player has earned the specified number of points to win.  Each hot dog eaten also offers a bonus to stamina and points toward victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the way, did I forget to mention it has BARF cards?  When played as a topping, the player automatically loses their lunch!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hot Dog Hooligans is now available at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.gurkengames.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.gurkengames.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
