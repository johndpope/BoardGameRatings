							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ditch Day Drifter</name>
									
			<description>The game's self-description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're an undergraduate at Caltech, and you wake up to discover that it's Ditch Day, the traditional event when seniors flee the campus for the day and leave behind &amp;quot;stacks&amp;quot; to protect their rooms from envious underclassmen. Go on a whimsical treasure hunt all over - and under - the campus, and see if you can find everything you need to break the stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ditch Day Drifter is the original TADS sample game, but it's also a fully fleshed-out adventure in the treasure-hunt tradition of the early text games. This is a fun and relatively easy game to play, and it's often recommended as a gentle introduction for novice adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
