			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Favored of Star Patrol is a co-operative, GM-less, dice-less storytelling game, in which a team of special galaxy patrollers face seemingly impossible odds and defeat them, all within 2 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heroes patrol the universe in a starship. Mysterious aliens have given each of the heroes a Sub-D Crystal, a powerful gem that orbits their heads. With the Crystal, they can sense danger, communicate telepathically over great distances, and even understand alien technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will take plot points and conflict points throughout the game, so make sure you have 2 kinds of tokens (candies, coins, stones; whatever) to represent these.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You also need a timer that can be set in at least 5-minute increments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
