			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is a class template?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A class template attaches to a character much like a monster template attaches to a monster, however instead of getting all the special abilities at once, you receive them as you gain levels in your particular class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What else will I find in A Question of Loyalty: A Guidebook to Military Orders?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will also find a special type of feat: an Order feat. These feats are designed specifically for individual orders as well as for those who belong to any order. This enables a character to capture the feel and benefits of belonging to a military order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, there are spells, great art, maps, and new rules for a character to create poultices, spell augmentation as well as prestige classes and epic prestige classes. Would you like not only to belong to an order, but also be the Grandmaster or the Knight Commander of a city, perhaps Argos? It is possible, for we have rules for that as well. We, at Alea Publishing Group, feel that a character should not just live in the world, but shape it as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
