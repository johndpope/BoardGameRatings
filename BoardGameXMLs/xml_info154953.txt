							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Pocket Guide to American Freeform</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's Blurb: This book looks at the emerging style of game design currently dubbed &amp;ldquo;American Freeform&amp;rdquo; and offers practical advice as well as historical information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The introductory section provides some context for all the practical information that follow, and includes sections on the development of the style and terminology, as well as some titles to check out if American Freeform ends up being your thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next comes a section on basic safety practices, with some explicit advice for players, facilitators, and designers. The subsequent guides assume you know your way around the basic safety practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Quick and Dirty Guides are aimed at facilitators, players, and designers. They&amp;rsquo;re intended to get you running, playing, and writing scenarios as quickly as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designers will probably benefit from reading all three guides to understand how all three groups work together to make great scenes. Facilitators may want to also read the player guide to understand what this style of game can mean for players and how to work with that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, we end with some advanced tips and longer discussion about workshops, debriefs, and meta-techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
