			<description>Intrigues of Asgard is fast playing card-drafting game set in the Norse Pantheon mythology. In order to lease the gods, players will make offering to them by playing cards to their tableau. Each card contains two goods - and player must decide, which of them will be prayed in this turn. At the end of the round all gods are returning favours, but only to the most generous player, granting him one time use special ability or some victory points. After 3 rounds of the game all gods score one more time - and the player with the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
