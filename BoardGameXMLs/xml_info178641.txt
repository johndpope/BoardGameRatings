			<description>Cyborgs vs Earth Crew.&lt;br/&gt; With Earth's depleted resources and overpopulation, another planet must be found to support Human life, and time is running out. One of 11 teams of space explorers, Earth Crew's mission is to travel to Kepler-452b, Earth Twin exoplanet, and confirm potential support for human life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But first the Crew must survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On entering Kepler-452b atmosphere, Earth Crew are attacked by Cyborgs, who invaded the planet already, merging with many of its primitive humanoids. Cyborgs have taken over communications with Earth and they're coming for the Crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will defeat the other in a battle for survival of their species, and domination of the Earth Twin planet?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose a side, Cyborg or Human, then trek your way through Kepler-452b terrain, fighting opponents, encountering strange Humanoids and plants, before taking over the opponent's command centre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyborgs game is a unique sci-fi strategy game, both cooperative and competitive. The goal is to beat your opponent team and dominate the planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
