							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Demonimancers</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demonimancersn are those reckless souls who tap into the boundless power of the Flame. Not simple fire dancing merrily on logs in the hearth, mind you, but raw, pure chaos and destruction. The Flame is the mystical manifestation of Entropy, that force which seems the inevitable undoing of all that is. Alone, Entropy has both positive and negative effects; it can be said that Entropy leads to change, progress, and creativity, after all. However, Flame is tainted with the influence of the Demon Lords of the Abyss and their boundless minions. These creatures have adopted the Flame as their own, and it has changed to reflect their angry, hateful nature.&lt;br/&gt;Demonimancers are those beings that work with and even worship these Demons; as such, they receive access to the fury and power of the Flame, but they also make themselves slaves to the wishes of their masters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
