			<description>&amp;ldquo;Sci-Fi themed board &amp;amp; card game for 2 players. Each figure represents a vehicle, mech, or infantry squad. Victory: You rout the enemy if you destroy 9+ of his units.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a chessboard or any other 8x8 grid. Miniatures or counters are used to represent the combat units. Each side starts with sixteen units: two Mechs, six Vehicles, and eight Infantry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A custom deck of cards is central to the play of the game. The players draw a hand of cards from a common deck. Card play determines when units may move, attack, or defend. In addition, Obstacle cards may be played in response to movement cards, sometimes casuing the moving unit to sustain damage. Other special cards allow a unit to both move and attack in the same turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
