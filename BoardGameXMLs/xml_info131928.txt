			<description>TradeOff is the game of stock market supremacy. It pits two to six players against each other in one simple challenge - to make the most money on the stock market so as to out-bid each other for luxury items. However the stock market is volatile and unpredictable. Take-over bids, profit warnings, insider trading and much more, all contribute to make TradeOff an exciting and strategic roller-coaster ride from beginning to end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW IT WORKS: The mat acts as the stock market and consists of four stocks. During the course of the game each stock's value independently rises and falls as dictated by the cards that players collect. Players can predict these rises and falls by studying their own cards and watching how their opponents are investing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Making an investment is easy. Players select a stock they think will rise in value and simply place a number of their chips on the mat next to the stock's share price marker. Profit and losses are easily calculated by either using the numbers printed on the mat or by using the free app available on our website. But it's not only the cards that determine how the stock's values will change. When players invest in, or sell an investment, the stock's value rises or falls accordingly. This gives players the chance to be nasty to each other by reducing the value of their opponents investments!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the course of the game auctions are held for luxury items. During these auctions players must out-bid each other to secure the purchase of the item. The first player to obtain the requisite number of luxury items wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
