							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Forgotten Kingdom</name>
									
			<description>Once upon a time.....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their was a great King that ruled over all the kingdom.  This was the land of the fairy tales of long ago.  The land where all the stories told at your bedtime came to life, where all your favourite childhood heroes and all those fearful villains coexisted in harmony.  But with His Majesty&amp;rsquo;s sudden disappearance, this once tranquil kingdom was thrown into chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forgotten Kingdom provides players with a unique and fully customizable gameplay, with a rule set that allows for shorter and longer games.  Certain character combinations YOU choose compliment each other by enhancing their abilities.  This provides a different and challenging gameplay experiance each time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before you begin, ensure that each player recieves an equal set of identical cards. Each player takes their deck of characters and shuffles them, drawing eight cards. During each turn of the game, players will assign a character from their hand, placing it face down on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will simultaneously reveal their character. Each player resolves the forgotten ability (Discard) first, followed by their character ability in play. The player with the total power after the forgotten and character abilities are resolved, wins the round and adds ONE to the total points earned on the score tracker.  Both players discard their character to the forgotten and play begins again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get the desired victory points decided on before the game begins wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
