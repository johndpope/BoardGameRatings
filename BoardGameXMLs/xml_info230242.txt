			<description>Salisbury Plain is a light 4X game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game. Your tribe of celts are seeking to dominate Salisbury Plain by controlling a majority of its sacred sites. To do so, you must explore the land, harvest resources, grow your tribe, and wrest control of the standing stones from other tribes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played by up to 5 players with the Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game, or up to 7 players if the Stonehenge: Nocturne Expansion is also used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
