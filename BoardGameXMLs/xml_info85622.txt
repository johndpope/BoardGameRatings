							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Steam and Steel: A Guide to Fantasy Steamworks</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not merely a list of steamwork devices and toys, this work discusses the vital aspects of adding steamworks to a game. How will steamworks affect society, magic, religion and warfare? How are these steamworks powered? Through coal and oil burning engines, arcane power sources, or the bodies and souls of those crushed on the field of combat? How do the various races use these new tools and weapons? How were they discovered?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This toolkit covers several possible source technologies for steamworks as well as three tech levels for those who create these machines. The book details a large variety of steamwork prosthetics and enhancements, weapons and equipment, massive suits (and less massive suits) of steamwork-enhanced body armor, and massive constructs of war. There are even steamwork liches, made from those machinists who refuse to die and pine for the immortality of their iron machines, and many other steamwork monstrosities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, with steam comes vehicles, and these rules for vehicles include many methods of upgrading existing vehicles as well as rules for designing steamwork ironclads, dirigibles and even laying down hundreds of miles of tracks through dark forests for steam-powered locomotives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything you could ever want from your steam technologies can be found within this volume... the only question left is how you will decide to implement these tools and machines into your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
