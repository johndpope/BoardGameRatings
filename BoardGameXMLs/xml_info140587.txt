							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mires of Mourning (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another of the Saturday Night Specials series. Adventurers are needed for a simple job: escort a catatonic prisoner of value to the Crown to a sanitarium where he can be safely held for treatment. What could be easier? But the sanitarium lies at the heart of the Creeping Mire, and it&amp;rsquo;s the rainy season. No patrols or contacts have been able to get through in weeks. What dangers await along the Swamp Road, and why don&amp;rsquo;t they want the prisoner to reach the sanitarium? And why does the sanitarium staff want the adventurers to place the prisoner in their care and leave as quickly as possible? What secrets are held within the mute man&amp;rsquo;s head that some would kill for&amp;hellip;or worse?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mires of Mourning is a Frog God Games adventure for 4-6 characters of 6th level with versions for the Pathfinder and Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry roleplaying games. Set in the generic Frog God Games setting for easy portability into your favorite campaign world. Players must brave the treacherous Swamp Road through the Creeping Mire in order to reach the Mourninghaven Sanitorium. The dangers within that decrepit hospice may be more fearsome than the dreaded swamp itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
