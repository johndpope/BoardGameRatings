							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Treehouse</name>
									
			<description>This video game was first released by Br&amp;oslash;derbund Software in 1991 although most copies were sold in educational supply stores instead of mainstream stores that sold computer software. The game's main characters are two opossums who at different times either wanted to play or take a nap. The game has also featured several minigames and integrated encyclopedic content. Using a first-person perspective, The Treehouse is intended for an audience of toddlers and children in preschool. Lloyd Lightningbug and Casey are two of the non-player characters to interact with; with Lloyd acting as the player's nemesis while Casey acts like an emcee/advisor to the player.&lt;br/&gt;It was re-released in 1996 for Windows versions 3.1 and 95. Although the Windows version has the same general activities, the characters, interface, and locations are different. As a product in the Early Learning Family Series, it was designed by the same people who made Kid Pix Deluxe, The Playroom and The Backyard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Treehouse (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
