			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Rock the Wizard&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Splut! is an abstract strategy boardgame. It has a fantasy theme and the looks of a chessgame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 To 4 players compete in an arena where they each control a team consisting of one large Troll and one Dwarf, led by a Sorcerer as coach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During your turn you have three moves to make with your pawns. Try to get your Troll to a Rock (four Rocks are provided in the arena) and let him throw it onto an opposing Sorcerer. This will eliminate that team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By moving your pawns ingeniously around the board, you must take out all other players' Sorcerers. Push other pawns with your Dwarf, levitate Rocks into place with your Sorcerer and throw Rocks around the arena with your Troll. Mind your head!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
