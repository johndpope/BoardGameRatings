			<description>Attacke belongs to the &amp;quot;Taschen-Spiele&amp;quot;(&amp;quot;pocket games&amp;quot;) series from Heyne which included 34 games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board shows a small castle on one side of the board, which the defender must try to defend against the attacks from the attacker. Both players have just one single playing piece for their regular moves. The rest of the playing pieces (34 chips for the defender, 2 tokens for the attacker) are used to keep track of the movement limitations of the players: while the attacker can use every path outside the castle only once, the defender cannot use the same path within the castle more than two subsequent turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the attacker manages to enter the castle exactly on the point where the defender is staying, he is the winner. If he is forced to enter the castle on an empty point, he has lost the game, because the defender will catch him on his next turn. The attacker has also lost the game, if he has no possible move left (outside of the castle).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game exists in 2 editions with different rules. According to the designer Tom Werneck, the first edition had the problem, that the attacker won in most cases, but the second edition did not help this game from being broken, because now, the defender won most times!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
