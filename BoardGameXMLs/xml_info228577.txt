			<description>In dicetto each player gets 4 dices in his own colour. Then 4 dice cards (from a stack) are layed open to fulfill, these cards show several combinations you must make (like a number, a pair, 3 of a kind and so on). &lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn you first take the cards with your dices on them from the previous turn, which give you victory points at the end of the game. Then you may roll your dices up to three times (all or some) to try to make any combinations shown on the dice cards. If you achieve doing this you place your dices on the card.&lt;br/&gt;If you have a better combination than a previous player you may return these dices to the owner and replace them with your own. In case of a tie both players roll one dice for the victory. The game ends when a player has collected 10 dice cards. &lt;br/&gt;Also included is one extra roll card which has the same principle as a chance card (just count the numbers on the dices rolled). When winning this card you may roll your dices 4 times on your next turn and return the card back next to the 4 dice cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play the game with or without bonus cards, if with you draw 4 bonus cards which give bonus points at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
