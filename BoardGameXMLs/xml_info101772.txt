							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Early Words</name>
									
			<description>A simple word game in which you make words of four letters or more using 112 letter cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are drawn from a deck, until someone can make a word. The player sets that word aside and it will count towards his or her final score. Play then continues in the same manner, but if someone can create a new word by adding newly drawn letter cards to a word someone else has already made, then that word is stolen. More complicated words are harder to make but are more difficult to steal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to make a prearranged number of words (either by making them with &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; letters from the card deck or by adding to words already in play, thereby stealing them), is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deriving from one of the oldest word construction games, Early Words is the fastest, the most skilful and the most cunning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
