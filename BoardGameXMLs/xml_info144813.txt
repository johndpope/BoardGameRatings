			<description>From Publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ATS TIMMES' ORCHARD II&amp;mdash;The All American 82nd Airborne Division is a new ATS Historical Module that tells the story of the Battle of Normandy from the perspective of the 82nd Airborne Division, the American paratroopers tasked with protecting the Utah Beach exits from the Hitlerian boast that the invaders would be...driven back into the sea...and the efforts of the tyrant's generals to carry out that wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LES HEUTES, NORMANDY, 8 June 1944: By D+2 Lt. Colonel Timmes and his men received an enormous psychological boost in the form of a telephone line across the marsh to the far shore of the Merderet River. He also had the shaken glidermen who had fallen back to the orchard after the confusion of the night. As dawn broke, the men of the 1/325th were in the process of regrouping, and had yet to dig in. There was no relief in sight for Timmes and his men. The &amp;ldquo;secret ford&amp;rdquo; was a precarious lifeline, swept by fire and barely usable during daylight hours. As casualties continued to mount among the men in the orchards scores of wounded threatened to overwhelm the wholly inadequate medical facilities. And the German determination to retake the crossing would soon prove to be undiminished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IN EACH GAME YOU GET:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large-hex 22&amp;rdquo; x 34&amp;rdquo; two-piece color map on heavyweight stock; researched onsite by designer Ian Daglish;&lt;br/&gt;A Battlefield Walkaround booklet&lt;br/&gt;7 Scenarios printed on heavyweight cards&lt;br/&gt;All the combat counters needed to play, just bring your ATS rules, play aids and markers and a ten sided die &lt;br/&gt;A snazzy ziploc-style bag to keep it all in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
