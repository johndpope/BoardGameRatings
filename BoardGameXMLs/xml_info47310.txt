			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My God, My God, Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2006. The Day of Judgment has dawned and the Lord God did separate the wheat from the chaff, the sinners from the virtuous, the damned from the saved. One hundred forty thousand souls felt the Rapture and were assumed into Heaven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then came the Day of Reckoning. Those who had marked their heads hands and hearts with the mark of the Beast were cast into the lake of fire Mankind's lordship over the beasts was ripped from him. The four Horsemen of the Apocalypse were loosed upon the unrighteous. The great Beast was given free reign to roam the wastelands and a third of the stars were ripped from the Heavens by the wings of Michael the Archangel. In the end, Death claimed almost every human that lived.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then things went horribly wrong. God's hand fell upon the dust that was neither wheat nor chaff... those in this brave age who had chosen neither God nor his Adversary. The Risen Christ could not damn them for their sins, but nor could he allow them to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;God's greatest creation, Mankind, was finally left to his own devices. They have many names, the Meek, the Lost Souls, the Forsaken, but they have all learned the same thing: &amp;quot;The Meek shall inherit the Earth&amp;quot; was not a promise... it was a warning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Meek Have Inherited the Earth... Poor Bastards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
