			<description>Birthday Gamesake&amp;trade; is a way to annually celebrate a child&amp;rsquo;s birthday or to honor a milestone birthday &amp;mdash; 13th to 95th. Add cards annually to a child&amp;rsquo;s Gamesake&amp;trade; and it becomes a dairy of their life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy and fun to create! Before or during the birthday celebration, family and friends record their favorite memories of the birthday honoree on the enclosed gift cards. The board can also be personalized for the birthday honoree by labeling destinations and creating new ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s unique to play! Birthday Gamesake&amp;trade; follows the life of the birthday honoree from birth (bassinet) to the cake. The personally created gift cards (recorded by friends and family) move the players through the board. The first player to reach the cake wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
