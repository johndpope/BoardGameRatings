			<description>Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Step into the mind of artist Stephanie Herrera as you play through sixteen high-resolution levels packed with challenging, yet soothing, difference-spotting gameplay. Each level is comprised of two images which contain subtle differences. Don't worry though, if things get too hard you can touch the hint button to get a nudge in the right direction. Online scoreboards and achievements let you share your progress and accomplishments with your friends as you compete for the largest time bonus or the highest overall score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dreams HD presents not only exceptional high resolution art work, but also a soundtrack so soothing, you may enter the world of dreams yourself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How To Play &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two pictures are presented to you. Examine both pictures and look for things that do not match between the two. Does the boy at that desk have a pencil on the left picture but not the right? Once you spot something just touch it. The faster you go the more points you will get, but each mistake you make will deduct from your points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
