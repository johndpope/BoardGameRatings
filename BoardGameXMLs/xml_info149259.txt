			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awesome Powers is a supplement for the BASH! Ultimate Edition RPG. Inside, you will find new Powers, new Enhancements, new Limitations, and new ideas to incorporate into your BASH! campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chiefly, this product is designed to allow you to create characters with themes, making use of pre-designed powers.  You can use these powers for inspiration, or you can even create your character by rolling for powers at random. As the Awesome Powers library grows, so will the list of available powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume 2 of Awesome Powers deals with powers of a Mechanical nature. There are dozens of powers for Bionic, Robotic, and Power Armor Suites here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll also find all new Limitations and Enhancements (like Doubles and Recoil), entirely new Advantages and Disadvantages (like Support Squad and Brain in a Jar), how to create your own Powers, and Random Character Creation!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the powers presented here explains how to replicate the power described as closely as possible using the existing BASH! Ultimate Edition rules.  In this second volume of Awesome Powers, we present to your three themes, or Power Suites, each based on a different mechanical trope. Future supplements will include Plant, Animal, Technopathy, Artifact, Psionic, and various other Power Suites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
