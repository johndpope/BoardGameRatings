			<description>Every player gets 20 cards in his/her color. Try to get a product together with four cards.&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to put the products on the board as favorable as possible. The player who puts his product on the middle of the board gets the most points.&lt;br/&gt;The player throw two dice and put his/her two pawns on the grid of the board. Where the two pawns come together, a player can put a card of his/her product.&lt;br/&gt;If there is already a card, a player can change the card (only if he/she is the owner of the product). Or can try to get the space for his own product.(players throw dice to get the space)&lt;br/&gt;When a player has placed all his/her products on the board, the counting begins. The player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
