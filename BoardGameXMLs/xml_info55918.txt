							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Echoes of the Jedi</name>
									
			<description>Echoes of the Jedi is the fourth adventure in the Dawn of Defiance &lt;br/&gt;campaign, which will take heroes from 1st level all the way through 20th level in a continuous storyline designed to give both players and Gamemasters a complete Star Wars Roleplaying Game Saga Edition experience. This adventure begins the second act of the campaign, which consists of four adventures: Echoes of the Jedi, The First to Strike, The Core of Corruption, and A Reckoning of Wraiths. &lt;br/&gt; By now, the heroes have been on a series of adventures together &lt;br/&gt;and should be well acquainted with one another. Several months have passed since the last adventure, and the heroes should start Echoes of the Jedi at 7th level and reach 9th level by the conclusion. With some modifications, this adventure can also be used as a stand-alone scenario or as part of your existing campaign. Over the course of this adventure, the heroes will visit the ruins of a Jedi academy on the planet Almas in search of a Jedi holocron, confront evil forces brought forth by a Sith holocron gatekeeper, and come face to face with Inquisitor Valin Draco.  (From Adventure Introduction)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
