							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kohlenklau Quartett</name>
									
			<description>This German card deck produced in 1944 was aimed at hammering home the importance of every German in saving energy to support the war effort. The 33-card deck includes lavish colour illustrations of the many vital uses of coal during WWII, especially in producing coal gas and plastics vital for the military.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While it is labelled as a &amp;quot;Quartett&amp;quot; game (Happy Families variant), it is designed to allow play of Schwarzer Peter (Old Maid variant) as well. For the former, 32 cards are divided into eight sets of four, and the player who collects the most sets wins. For the latter, the 33rd Kohlenklau card is added, and each set of four is divided into two pairs, one with red dots and the other with black dots. Players try to collect pairs while avoiding being stuck with the Kohlenklau card at the end of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The eight themes illustrated are: Coal for Fighting; Coal Plastics; Coal Extraction; Coal Processing; Coal Burning; Coal in Industry; Coal Conversion; and &amp;quot;Wonders from Coal&amp;quot;, other uses including medicines, propellants, dyes, candles and soap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game is undated, it includes a calendar card showing the day of the week for each date, and the pattern is correct for 1944.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
