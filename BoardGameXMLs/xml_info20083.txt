			<description>Players form teams of any number of players. One member of the team takes one card from each of four decks to determine the situation to performed before and guessed by the teammates. An example of a situation is &amp;ldquo;I am a brave &amp;ndash; dentist &amp;ndash; and I eat spaghetti &amp;ndash; like a left-handed motorcycle cop.&amp;rdquo; If the teammates can guess the situation within a two-minute time limit the team scores the value of cards drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team with the most points after a number of rounds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is loosely based on the long-running radio and television series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
