			<description>Game Instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you place bets and your snake will lay an egg, which acts like dice. Your Snake will play against the computer's Snake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the first two rolls, you may roll again until your score approaches 41, but you lose if your score is over 41. Each roll is from 1 to 22 points. You win if your total score is closer to 41 than the machine's. A roll of &amp;quot;SNAKE EGG&amp;quot; wins and a roll of &amp;quot;SCRAMBLED EGG&amp;quot; loses. If the final result of your rolls is the same as the machine's, no one wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This unique animated graphics game has SOUND. Simply plug the cord which now goes into the AUX of your cassette recorder into any audio amplifier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author's Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I wrote the original Snake Eggs program for the Radio Shack TRS-80 computer in 1979.  It was fairly well received, though not as well as Android Nim. The animation of the snakes, which roll eggs to represent drawing cards in the game Blackjack, was the highlight of the otherwise simple playing game.  This updated version has all the cute animations, and then some. This game offers a modified version of Blackjack. The Help Screen shown below outlines the way the game plays. This version also features a macho male snake that orders the egg laying and two sassy female snakes with nasty temperaments that roll the eggs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original program was well tested by my 7th and 8th grade students back in the late 70's. This version has not had the advantage of a bunch of eager players, so, though I have tested it a whole lot, anyone who downloads it will also have a chance to find bugs (heaven forbid).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this version, I have given the computer an average ability to win. There is no fancy AI for it to use. Randomness is mostly it. But then, Blackjack does have a great element of chance in it, I think.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
