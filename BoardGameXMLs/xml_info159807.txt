			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swallowed by a gigantic sinkhole decades ago, the subterranean village of Severed Umbra has only recently been discovered by adventurers seeking a route to the Ebon Realm. Set around a deep, subterranean lake the villages residents &amp;ndash; a curious mix of surface dwellers and dark creepers &amp;ndash; live in relative peace and harmony. The arrival of surface dwellers, though, has caused tension in the village, as few of the villagers trust outsiders. With its strategic location as a staging post for expeditions into the Ebon Realm and its abundant resources of silver and precious gemstones Severed Umbra is unlikely to remain a free village for much longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subterranean Enclaves are short, richly detailed supplements that each present a single subterranean settlement ready to insert into almost any home campaign. Perfect for use as a waystop on the road to adventure or as an adventure site themselves, Subterranean Enclaves present the details so the busy GM can focus on crafting exciting, compelling adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a Dual Format PDF. The downloadable ZIP file contains two versions, one optimised for printing and use on a normal computer and one optimised for use on a mobile device such as an iPad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
