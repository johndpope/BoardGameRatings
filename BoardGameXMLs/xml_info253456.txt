							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Savings Game</name>
									
			<description>A simplistic roll &amp;amp; move game deriving from Landlord game variants like Monopoly. In this game the players receive 'income' cards which earn them money and 'expenditure' cards which cost them money, and can keep their money either in cash or savings account, that latter of which recieve interest (the game includes a calculator) based on the current interest rates.&lt;br/&gt;The game is intended as an educational tool and was supported by the Britannia Building Society 'borne out of our desire for financila education to be made available for all school children'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
