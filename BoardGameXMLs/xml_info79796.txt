			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Played individually or in teams, this game involves travelling around a board, collecting letters which you'll use at the end of the game to make as many words as possible. Getting around the board *quickly* isn't necessarily a good idea because then you'll have less letters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite dice rolling, multiple tracks on the board allow players to make choices about their paths. Landing in some places get you more letters or let you steal letters from opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blurb from publisher website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MOTUS is an exciting game of strategy, where players use creative thinking to collect letters while travelling around the board, using the luck of the die. The game is designed to be played by young and old, capable spellers and not so capable spellers. Its clever design makes for an even playing field, so everyone can enjoy this exciting game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Widely tried, tested and proven throughout Australian schools, teachers and students all agree that this thrilling board game is not only a world of fun but a fantastic way to improve student spelling capability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
