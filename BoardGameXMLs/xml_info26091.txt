			<description>This game had several releases. It was originally released by Spika, a game publisher from Karl-Marx-Stadt (now Chemnitz) in East Germany (DDR). Bunte Trikots is a cycling game with a 47x34cm. board with an indoor oval cycling track (with 100 spaces) on it. The original version from 1959 had a blue background, the 1964 version a grey background. In the '60s a Belgian version (also with a blue background) was released in both French and Dutch language. There are 6 plastic cyclists (one for each player) that move after rolling a die. There are different rules for in total 5 different disciplines that can be raced on the track. Vintage game for collectors and cycling lovers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
