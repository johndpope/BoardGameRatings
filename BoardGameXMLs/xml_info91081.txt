							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mystara: The Known World</name>
									
			<description>From the Download Website (Dragon Age Oracle):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 110-page, fully bookmarked sourcebook bringing in the Mystara setting into the AGE System. Many people will know Mystara by its other name, The Known World, the default setting for D&amp;amp;D during the days of the boxed sets (Basic, Expert, Companion, Master, Immortal). Considering how much I keep comparing Dragon Age to the original D&amp;amp;D Basic Red Box, it is just fitting that we now have The Known World made available for AGE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find a work worthy of many gaming companies. The sourcebook is well laid-out and well illustrated with reused artwork. It is a good introduction to the world of Mystara, presenting enough information about the various parts of the world for a newcomer to be able to find their way around, while veterans of the Known World will find the sections a good memory refresher for everything they already know about the setting. (For the veterans: the sourcebook draws most of its setting information from the later incarnation of Mystara that came in a boxed set and which was set after all the events depicted in the Gazetteer series.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This item is downloadable on the Dragon Age Oracle website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
