			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an age of guns or a realm of spells, archery is a matter of finesse and style as much as a matter of combative effectiveness. Confronted with guns and grenades in the modern age or with spells and alchemy in the realms of fantasy the archer can quickly find himself wanting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But necessity is the mother of invention, and invention is the accomplice of great heroes and villains everywhere. . A gun may be lethal but it cannot bind an opponent in a net with one shot and shower a lock with acid with another. A wand may produce any number of magical effects but it cannot send that effect hurtling towards the enemy on a speeding shaft of wood and sharpened metal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the right arsenal of trick arrows an archer can be a wonder to behold: deadly and precise while flexible and creative. Whether fighting crime in the 21st century or doing battle with monsters in the 8th, it is the ammunition and the man (or woman) wielding it that makes all the difference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trick Arrows is the the third in a line of affordable mini-supplements from Octavirate Games. It features 15 new trick arrows for your d20 character and a new weapon material. Stun or slay your foes with detonator arrows, gouger arrows, net arrows, smoke arrows, reservoir arrows, syringe arrows and more or use dynamite or lamp oil to improvise deadly new projectiles. Suitable for almost any d20 campaign and complete with prices and craft check difficulties for modern, fantasy and sci-fi settings. And, as an added bonus, a new feat is included&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
