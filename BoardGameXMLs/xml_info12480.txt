							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Power Blackout!</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within 16 rounds or fewer, bring Power to all 100 Populated Centers on the Continent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are CEOs in control of our own Power Grids on the Continent. Each of us is responsible for bringing and maintaining full electrical service to our Populated Centers. There are Bonus Revenues and other Perks for fully servicing one&amp;rsquo;s own Area. However, as we have learned from several recent Blackouts, each Grid is interdependent with other Grids, so CEOs must work together for the survival of the Continental Power System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Negotiation and deal-making skills are very important to everyone&amp;rsquo;s success. Thus, tension is created between balancing the needs of one&amp;rsquo;s own constituency and the overall good. When is it best to compromise and when is it best to be selfish? The well-being of millions of people are at stake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.familypastimes.com/12%20to%20Adult/blackout.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.familypastimes.com/12%20to%20Adult/blackout.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
