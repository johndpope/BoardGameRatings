			<description>The game is played on a board topologically equivalent to a 15x15 grid with all points connected horizontally, vertically and diagonally. The manner of play is best described as both reminiscent of Go and yet markedly different. A variable number of pieces, subject to strict rules, are placed in a line on each turn. Opponents' pieces are captured by replacement when any but the first piece placed onto the board [which must be on a free space] overlies an opposing piece, but one's own pieces block new lines of pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
