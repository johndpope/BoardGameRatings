			<description>This is an expansion and requires the original game &amp;quot;Don't Fall in the Mead Hall.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game includes a brand new Action Die that you may use instead of the original on your turn. It also includes a medium-sized bag so you can take the game anywhere with ease. This expansion brings in another table with 5 pawns so now you can play with a 5th player. Also included are 5 brand new Sk&amp;aacute;l cards that you can add to your Sk&amp;aacute;l deck (if you have it) and the optional Tipsy card deck.&lt;br/&gt; In addition to the drinking, toasting and fighting of the original Don't fall in the Mead Hall, players now have a chance to sober up (passed out Vikings can wake up) by rolling the feast symbol. Every player will sober up by two (the drunk die will go down two). If you roll the turkey legs symbol your table sobers up by two and you choose another player to sober up by two. Vikings can now bring a sword and shield to the battle mat for a fight to the death. It's double the pain if you roll the new double &amp;quot;Skal!&amp;quot;. Every tables drunk die will go up by two. Watch out because there's a chance Vikings at your table will get into a fight with each other if you roll the double fist. The Tipsy cards (optional, if you want to use them) add some extra mystery to each round and can make the game go faster. At the end of each round flip a Tipsy card and see if one of your Vikings can't hold his own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last table with at least one Viking standing wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
