							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The City of Ravenclaw: The Golden Fang Inn and Tavern</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Golden Fang is a recent addition to the Civic Quarter and serves a very upscale clientele. There is music and entertainment every night and has become a popular destination for wealthy merchants and young nobles alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Golden Fang is named after a local folk tale about a gold encrusted viper's fang worn as a necklace. One night, when the owner was removing it, the fang pricked his hand. The owner later died. The moral of the tale is to reinforce that just because something is pretty or valuable doesn't mean it isn't still dangerous. This describes the owner of the Golden Fang, Ana Renwood, to perfection. Beautiful and deadly, the youngest member of the Eight has quickly made a name for herself in the last few years as a woman of some cunning and a crafty business woman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
