							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eternity Wars: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Eternity Wars: The Card Game is a 2 player strategic card game of epic warfare. Players construct buildings to establish economic superiority on an expanding battlefield.  Armies are deployed to clash in fantastic battles.  And in the end, the player that destroys the enemy Government Center first, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game draws elements from the Eternity Wars board game, a game inspired by Real Time Strategy video games. After running a Kickstarter campaign that failed to fund, only 20 units were ever produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eternity Wars: The Card Game uses an &amp;quot;expanding battlefield&amp;quot; mechanic, where an invisible grid is created and anchored by the buildings that each player constructs.  The more buildings a player constructs, the more room he/she has to deploy and move units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
