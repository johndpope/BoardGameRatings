			<description>Junishi is an abstract strategy game inspired by the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac. (Each player controls 6 of the 12 animals.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Junishi is to move one of your 6 animals into your opponents Gate, which is located at the opposite end of the board, in between your opponents Spawn Areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin at either end of a board comprised of 19 circles arranged in a hexagonal pattern. &lt;br/&gt; At the start of the game there are not any pieces on the board. Any pieces that a player wishes to use must be &amp;quot;spawned&amp;quot; in one of the Spawn Circles on that players side of the board.  &lt;br/&gt; Players may move the pieces that they already have on the board either by moving them into adjacent circles or by jumping over friendly pieces.&lt;br/&gt; Players also may use their animals to capture their opponents animals by jumping over them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Junishi is a simple and fast paced abstract strategy game that is easy to learn and usually plays in under 20 minutes. It comes in a little cloth bag that also serves as the game board&lt;br/&gt;and it can be carried in any pocket that is big enough to hold a pack of gum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Junishi is a complete game that can be expanded by combining it with its sister games Zodiakos, 12 Moons, and Neteru.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(source : the publisher)&lt;br/&gt; Integrates with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    12 Moons&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Zodiakos&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Neteru&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
