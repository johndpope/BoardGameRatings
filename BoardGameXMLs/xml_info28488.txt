							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gerald Mcboing Boing Game</name>
									
			<description>From the manufactuerer's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the Academy Award winning Dr. Seuss cartoon, and now featured everyday on the Cartoon Network, Gerald McBoing Boing Game is the story of 6-year-old Gerald: an adventurous little boy with a unique talent for speaking only in sound effects. The game allows young children to join Gerald on his adventures both big and small as he honks, whistles, clangs, toots, and cuckoos through his day. The fun game will entertain and teach, using sound association, to engage its younger players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 2 or more players Ages 3 - 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
