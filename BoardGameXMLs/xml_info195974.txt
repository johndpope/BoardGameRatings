							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Interactive Adventures of Dog Mendonça &amp; Pizzaboy</name>
									
			<description>Based on Filipe Melo, Juan Cavia and Santiago Villa`s IP, &amp;ldquo;The Adventures of Dog Mendon&amp;ccedil;a &amp;amp; Pizza Boy&amp;rdquo;,  was conceived as a complex universe, full of compelling stories and attractive characters. To broaden the experience we have created several entertainment properties, with an independent life, that will work as multiple entry points into this universe. Each of these products will develop diﬀerent aspects of the plot and different time frames for the viewer to unravel all the mysteries surrounding the Dog Mendon&amp;ccedil;a Universe across an array of Medias:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; A series of Published COMIC BOOKS: volumes have been published in Portugal by Tinta Da China and by Dark Horse Comics in the US and the UK while a new volume is in the works.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; A series of VIDEOGAMES (in production): set as a series of episodical point-and-click adventure games that will deal with a new case in each installment. The mysteries usually go deeper than what the group expects, forcing them to work their full potential and, from time to time, to save the world. Not a big deal, when it comes to them. The first game will start with a new plot but not as a sequel to the books. The characters will be introduced in a fun way -as in the old Sam &amp;amp; Max games- and then, if the user reads the comics, he&amp;rsquo;ll pick up some jokes or references to those stories; but they won&amp;rsquo;t affect the game&amp;rsquo;s experience. Supported platforms: Mobile (IOS/Android), PC (Mac/Windows/Linux) and Consoles (PS3, Vita).&lt;br/&gt;-TV(in development): With a lot of comedy, action and adventure we&amp;rsquo;ll get to know Dog and his team while travelling the world to whatever place they are hired to solve a new case. In each episode Eurico, as the new intern of the company, will learn how Dog and Pazuul solved a similar case in the past, and then try to face the danger himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
