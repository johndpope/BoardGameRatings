			<description>&amp;quot;Card game based on the Terry Gilliam Movie. Each player controls a group of diminutive individuals in possession of a stolen Map of all Time &amp;amp; Space. Players race to steal the most treasure from History.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Each player is represented by an abstract group of Time Bandits of Uncertain number. In addition to these abstract individuals, players will recruit Character cards. Character cards represent more concrete individuals with special abilities.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players travel between the Time of Legends and various historical periods represented by Location Cards. Each time a player travels to a new Location, the player may steal a Treasure. Danger cards (Foe, Delay, or God) may be played on other players to hamper their efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game ends when a turn starts with no cards left in the deck. The player with the most Treasure cards at the end of the game wins. If tied the player with the most characters wins. If still tied, the shortest player wins.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
