			<description>A game that was played by the Passamaquoddy Indians of the northeastern United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components include a shallow wooden bowl (about 12 inches across and 2 inches deep), 6 plum stones (plain on one side and carved and colored on the other), forty-eight small sticks approximately 6 inches long, 4 longer sticks, and 1 longer stick which is notched.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plum stones are placed in the dish which is banged on a blanket on the ground causing the stones to jump. The resulting combination of face up and face down stones controls how many sticks the player may take from the central pile or from the other player. The goal of the game is to win all of the sticks from the other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is similar to Hubbub.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
