			<description>Pick your monster and collect all their missing shapes by reaching into the bag. No peeking! An ideal &amp;quot;hands on&amp;quot; activity to encourage tactile skills in young learners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, a player draws a Monster Piece from the cloth bag.  They can't peek in the bag, but they can spend some time feeling the shapes of the pieces in the bag before selecting one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the selected Monster Piece matches an empty space with the same shape and color on their Monster Board, they may fill that space with the Monster Piece.  If the space is already occupied by another matching Monster Piece, then they must put the selected marker back into the cloth bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has either placed a piece on their Monster Board, or returned a piece to the bag, they pass clockwise.  The game ends when one player has filled their Monster Board with the correct Monster Pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT THEY'LL LEARN: Mental Imaging, Probability, Mind/Hand Coordination&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
