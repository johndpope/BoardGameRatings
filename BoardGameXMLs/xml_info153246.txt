			<description>A fast-paced soccer flicking game featuring over 30 unique teams. Each team  has star players with different special powers that allow players to bend the rules in their favor! In this game, players use indoor sized teams (6 players per team). This game is extremely tiny and each team is available separately in little boxes about the size of ice cubes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is simple. Players take turns. On his/her turn a player may flick one if his/her pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
