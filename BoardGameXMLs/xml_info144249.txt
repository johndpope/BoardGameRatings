			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evolution of various societies has led to a constant and thrilling rush to new and exploratory technologies. With the principles of offense and defense, this has been a spinning wheel where quite literally the dog is chasing its own tail. Since the earliest days when Cro-Magnon would battle Neanderthals, there has been a constant arms-race to see who could survive the lasts&amp;rsquo; attack. Whether a large piece of tree bark designed to block the blow of an impromptu club, or a 1&amp;rdquo; thick piece of hardened steel meant to stop a 7.62 bullet, the race has changed little when it comes to weaponry. Arms and armor will always be an important part of any fantasy roleplaying game&amp;mdash;whether the knight in shining armor, or the swift seafaring buccaneer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
