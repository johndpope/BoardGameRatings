			<description>Noisy card game. There are 52 cards, in 13 sets of four identical cards. In addition, there are 8 tradesmen cards.&lt;br/&gt;Players draw a random trade and then try to win tricks. A trick comprises of two or more like cards. The method of winning these tricks is noisily encouraged. Each player has one card, face-down and a trade card exposed. When the face-down cards are turned over simultaneously, each player will look for two or more identical cards. If there are any, the players revealing these cards must be first to demand a recognised quantity of any commodity that the tradesmen involved normally stock (e.g. a pound of butter, a bottle of scent and so on). The first to do this wins the trick (all the identical cards involved) and a new round begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
