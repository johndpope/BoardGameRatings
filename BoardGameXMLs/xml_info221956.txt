							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Rat Collector</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When one has the power to summon and control thousands, it&amp;rsquo;s only natural that they live in squalor and wear patchwork cloths stitched together from various scraps of cloth and eat the kind of food that anyone else would question is even worth calling food . . . . . right? Well it is when you&amp;rsquo;re summoning controlling and even identifying as  . . .  RATS! Eeeew, rats . . .really? . .  . YUP!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this spotlight is Ferdinand Underhill, the rat collector &amp;amp; his verminous minions. Additionally included are two new evildoer traits for your evildoer creation toolkit, The vermin mage trait &amp;amp; swarm trait as well as 4 sample creatures using the swarm trait. Also at the end of the book is a variant use for the swarm trait, illustrating how it can be used for gangs of creatures, so that having your heroes have a harrowing fight facing countless enemies can be a lot easier and more epic to run!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rat collector and his minions are intended to be used against level 4-7 heroes, depending on how much like a manipulative mastermind the rat collector is played. With the new evildoer traits however, new enemies that can pose unique threats to your group of heroes can be made that can haunt those heroes for the entirety of their adventuring career!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
