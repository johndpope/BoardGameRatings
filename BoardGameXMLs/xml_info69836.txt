			<description>[From the back cover]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic things you need to understand and then you can play Checkers with a partner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners: face each other and each player plays in turn in a clockwise direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All checker pieces: move or jump according to the Standard Rules of Checkers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...Except...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     each single checker changes its forward direction only once...when it moves or lands in or beyond a square with double lines. NOW, the checker piece is directed to its nearest opponent...&amp;quot;very easy&amp;quot; to follow on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Double lines have no meaning to KINGS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game:&lt;br/&gt;Each player will try to jump and capture all of his two opponents' pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Win:&lt;br/&gt;All opponents' pieces must be captured or blocked. A blocked checker piece cannot move. Otherwise, the game is a DRAW.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cutthroat (2, 3 or 4 players): each player plays independently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
