			<description>Fur vs Scale is a fast-paced tabletop card game for 2-4 players, pitting anthropomorphic animal heroes of rival kingdoms against each other in strategic combat. The game captures the ebb and flow of an arcade fighter, challenging players to construct winning combinations of attacks, blocks, counters, super moves, and special abilities over four rounds of combat to reach 60 points and be crowned victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin by selecting a hero, each with unique special abilities and a pool of Move List cards. At the start of each round, both players construct their Move List of six cards from their hero's limited pool. Play then alternates as each player adds one of their cards to the table, creating a Fight Map of varying point values. Special abilities, combinations, and power ups may also be used to alter the Fight Map or achieve bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all Move List cards have been played, scores are tallied for the round. If a player has accumulated 60 or more points, they are are declared the winner. Otherwise, players construct a new Move List and begin another round. If neither player has accumulated 60 points after four rounds, the game ends in a draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
