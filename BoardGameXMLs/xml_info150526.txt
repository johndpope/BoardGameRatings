			<description>Kokkuri Jinro is a simple and quick Werewolf-game using the mechanism from the Japanese traditional &amp;quot;boogie board&amp;quot; fortune-telling method in which people sitting around a table keep their index finger on a coin that glides around a piece of paper with letters on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this take on the traditional Werewolf game &amp;mdash; with villagers trying not to be eaten while the secret werewolf player tries to do snack on the villagers &amp;mdash; no one ever closes their eyes; instead only the Werewolf player is allowed to steer the coin, and the other players try to find out who that guy is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the coin reaches a player, that player loses a life; each player has two lives to start, and if they lose both lives, they're out of the game. After someone loses a life from the coin, the players discuss and vote on who to string up, and that player also loses one life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players out of the game reveal who they were. The game continues until either the Werewolf dies (in which case the villagers win) or only two players remain, with the Werewolf being one of them (in which case the Werewolf wins).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
