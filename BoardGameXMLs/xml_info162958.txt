							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dragon Disciple</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As some of the most ancient, powerful, and capricious creatures in existence, dragons occasionally enter into trysts with unsuspecting mortals or sire offspring with exceptional individuals. Likewise, the great power wielded by these creatures has long intrigued wizards and alchemists who have sought various magical methods to infuse their bodies with draconic power. As a result, the blood of dragons runs through the veins of many races. For some, this heritage manifests as a sorcerous bloodline; for others the power of their draconic ancestors becomes an obsession and they focus all their magic on expressing it, becoming something close to true dragons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prestige Class: Dragon disciple.&lt;br/&gt;Build Classes: Magus, sorcerer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role: With the magic at their disposal, dragon disciples can assume the typical role of a magic-user, hampering the movement of the enemy and hurling damage-dealing spells at their opponents. The dragon disciples&amp;rsquo; draconic abilities make these versatile spellcasters even more formidable, as they use their breath, natural weapons, and flight to destroy their foes directly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
