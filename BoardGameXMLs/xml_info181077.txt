							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombie Slayer</name>
									
			<description>Exterior - night.&lt;br/&gt;A lone slayer stands in the market place, gazing.&lt;br/&gt;Suddenly, a flash of light appears in the sky, and a flaming meteor plummets to the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;All right&amp;quot;, he thinks. &amp;quot;Now we're cooking!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Zombie Slayer!&lt;br/&gt;An evil necromancer has overrun a (formerly) peaceful village with his army of zombies.The zombies are roaming the streets in search for human flesh. Though there are some townspeople left, the main attraction is you - the slayer that has been called to take care of the problem.&lt;br/&gt;Can you save the townies and defeat the evil necromancer?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie Slayer is a free print &amp;amp; play solitaire fantasy game, putting you into the role of a Warrior that has been called to rid the evil off the land. &lt;br/&gt;For starters, you might want to play with the pre-generated slayer, but there are rules provided to create your own slayer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You explore the town by drawing the different parts of the town from a deck. Whenever you move through the town, Zombies will spawn around you, trying to finish you off. &lt;br/&gt;If you're lucky, you may run into villagers as well or maybe in one of the buildings you find your treasure helping you on the way?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aside from the card drawing exploration mechanic, everything else (combat, searching) is dice driven - and you will roll dice a lot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
