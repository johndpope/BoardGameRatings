							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Coral Islands</name>
									
			<description>Coral Islands is the 2-in-1 game featuring 2 competitive games utilising dice stacking as the prominent mechanic. Players are tasked with conservation efforts to repopulate coral as well as redevelop islands to make them conducive to animal life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Coral,&amp;quot; designed by Richard Maass, pits players to use colourful translucent dice (the coral) to artificially repopulate coral life. Players create reefs of their own colour by matching 3d patterns of their dice for in game scoring and using pip values of live coral at the top of stacks for end game scoring. The game requires players to act strategically by long term play, but also in 3 dimensions making the game experience very unique. The game also features four unique and small cardboard fish to allow players to give fish and coral to nest symbiotically - including a clownfish and a starfish. The player with the highest combined score taking into consideration live reefs (pips at the top of a stack) and pattern making (in-game 3d scoring cards) is considered the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Islands,&amp;quot; designed by Rohan Dargad, asks players to move around archipelago islands from sea-level heights to mountainous terrain in a concerted effort to reclaim lost land caused by rising sea levels. Players thus take the roles of conservation charities. The different coloured dice represent different geology of the islands. Each round 3 land cards are dealt which gives the active player the opportunity to move around an archipelago segment. These are overseen by conservation specialists which are asymmetric rule changes when a stack of cards is taken. Players then take and keep one of the cards from the stack to indicate their geological specialism - and move one of the dice on the archipelago a number of times based on the height of the stack of cards. Dice are continually moved around in this way , until the end of the game where players with the highest specialisms claim the most mountainous lands to score prestige points. The player with the highest prestige wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
