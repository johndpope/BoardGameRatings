			<description>This is a tactical space combat game in the Warriors of the Dark Star: The Age of the Neutron Wars series, and includes the second edition rulebook for that game (as a series rulebook).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a GFG catalog (reproduced verbatim):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        This &amp;quot;WD&amp;quot; Game pits the powerful Omega Ship Constitution Class against the Deadly Unruk Dreadnaughts of the N'Dridds and the Sumnul Betas. Scenarios such as the &amp;quot;Attack on the Outposts&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Seige of the Frontiers&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Plunder Raids of the Brain Slaves&amp;quot;, etc. This is a detailed comparison of what occured in the BFA &amp;quot;Deliverance from Beyond the Stars&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Geomorphic Map&amp;mdash;Sections, Hardbacked, solid boards, each one 11x14 inches, can be combined into a 22x28-inch mapboard, or a 44x14-inch, 64x11-inch mapboard, or any other combination. The Boards here have 9 different kinds of Space Obstacles and Vortexes. The amazing thing about WD boards is that the four boards in this game can be connected to the mapboards of other WD games, and ALL WD GAMES have their boards so made that they can be interconnected with all the other WD versions. Counters are on 8 1/2 x 11-inch large sheets showing the weapons systems in detail that the silhouettes on the BFA counters only implied. THIS GAME CAN BE PLAYED BY ONE OR MORE PEOPLE (UP T0 11 can play). Each player handles one ship. Sun Slayers specializes in OutPosts, Beacons, Omega Ships, Monitors; all are enclosed and utilize the drama of the long-term duties of the Star Forces in the  defensive OutPosts that might be raided at any time to poke a hole into Federation territory, for Taal Battle Cruisers to rush through and how fast Thetan and Alliance ships can rush to the aid of the Defensive Line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
