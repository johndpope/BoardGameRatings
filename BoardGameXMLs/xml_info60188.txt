			<description>This is a children's roll and move game based on Pachisi . Players need a 5 to start one of their four markers on the start space. Some spaces can only be occupied by one player. A roll of 6 gets you another turn. You can't move if your move will take you to a space occupied by 2 or more markers, If you land on another player you send them back to their starting box. You can have all of your markers in play at once. The first player to get all four markers on the SuperStar at the center of the board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
