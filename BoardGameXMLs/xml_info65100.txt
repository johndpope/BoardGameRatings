			<description>In this pure roll-and-move game, each player is a hunter. Each hunter moves along his own path. When reaching an animal field exactly, the animal is shot and the player gains points. There are some positions on the board where a player can shoot another player's animal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with most points in the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
