			<description>Want more realism, direct action play, and observable battle results without losing the lively historic qualities? Tired of small gaming counters, sluggish play processes, or the mindless arcade play of many computer war games? Historians and gamers will find the game pace, play method, and varied outcomes to be fascinating.  Parents, teachers, and students will recognize the great advantage of learning while playing.&lt;br/&gt; In this game, you make duplicate copies of the battleship target illustrations and the numbered &amp;quot;Special Factors&amp;quot; cards. Then follow the simple attack procedures against each battleship.  Damage scores will vary depending where bomb  hits occur plus a random number variation.  Hence, player can expect a different outcome each time they play the game. The game can be plyed solo to in small groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is part of a larger Pearl Harbor Re-enactment Guide.  This part of the game based upon the high level bomber attack on Battleship Row, Pearl Harbor.  Forty-eight high Level bombers, in ten arrow formations, carrying and dropped the secret &amp;quot;Dragon Tooth&amp;quot; 800kg armor piercing bomb against the inboard battleship on Battleship Row, Pearl Harbor.  Fouled by smoke and sun glare, they managed to make a dismal six hits on American battleships.  Although, only six big bombs hit American battleships, one No.80 bomb struck and penetrated the USS Arizona's forward powder magazine causing a violent explosion.  The game can be adapted easily for solo or team play.   Can you do better?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play Commander Mitsuo Fuchida's attack on American battleships in Pearl Harbor.  The attack that ended  the battleship era.  Game &amp;quot;Special Factors&amp;quot; features include, anti-aircraft resistance,  Shoot Downs, Damage Aircraft, Aborted Runs, Smoke differential, Powder Magazine Hit, Near Miss Damage, and a variable Math Expression Calculating Bomb Hit Damage.  Final game score can be matched against the historical recorded or tallied in other ways (percent damage and/or number of hits).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game will be shipped in large envelope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Printed Game Parts Include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt;Activity Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt;Illustrated &amp;quot;Graphic&amp;quot; Activity Diagram/Guide&lt;br/&gt;Pearl Harbor Map (Gray scale coloring on letter size paper)&lt;br/&gt;Battleship Target Illustrations (Gray scale prints on legal size 20# paper format) USS Nevada, USS Arizona, USS West Virginia &amp;amp; USS Tennessee, USS Oklahoma &amp;amp; USS Maryland, USS Pennsylvania, and USS California&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt;Score Sheets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt;Unique Bomb Plot Overlay Transparency&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt;Randomizing Number (print &amp;amp; cut) cards  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Game Parts, Target Illustrations, and Score Sheets are Copyrighted  but can be reproduced  for non-commercial use by the individual purchaser for years of play in your home or in your school classroom&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
