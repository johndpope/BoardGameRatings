							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Renaissance Warfare</name>
									
			<description>Renaissance Warfare was third in the SAGA series of rulebooks for period warfare.  It is a set of miniatures rules simulating land warfare in Europe and Asia from 1494 to 1690.  It may be used with any scale of figures.  There are extensive rules for organization but players may use figures based in the standard DBx format with little problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules contain rich detail on warfare in this period of many unit types while still providing a playable game that will see a result in a few hours.  There are 49 army lists that themselves provide a rich source of information and cover the important armies of Asia as well as those of Europe.  There are also lists for relatively minor powers such as two lists for Ireland and one for the Knights of St. John.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
