			<description>DreamMix TV World Fighters (ドリームミックスTV ワールドファイターズ Dorīmumikkusu Tīvī Wārudo Faitāzu) features licensed characters from a few well-known Japanese companies, including Konami, Hudson Soft, and Takara.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fledgling television program has been suffering from poor audience approval, and the station that carries the show has informed its producers that they will have to rectify the situation or face inevitable cancellation.  An unorthodox plan is implemented: broadcast a contest pitting various superstars from differing realities in physical combat in order to increase ratings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to four gamers can choose from seventeen playable characters, each with their own themed backdrop, from video game and toy series such as Castlevania, Metal Gear, Gradius, Bomberman, Adventure Island, Bloody Roar, Transformers, Beyblade, and Micronauts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Konami characters:&lt;br/&gt;    Simon Belmont, based on his Castlevania Chronicles design by Ayami Kojima.&lt;br/&gt;    TwinBee&lt;br/&gt;    Power Pro-kun (Jikkyō Powerful Pro Yakyū '94 - Super Famicom 1994) Power Pro-kun is the only character who does not speak&amp;mdash;in the Power Pro series, he can represent a large number of baseball players as opposed to anyone specifically. Bearing that in mind, all of his onscreen actions are complemented by prerecorded commentary.&lt;br/&gt;    Solid Snake, based on his Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty incarnation. His alternate palettes on the character select screen are Iroquois Pliskin, Tuxedo Snake, and Solid Snake as he appeared in the first installment of the Metal Gear Solid series.  DreamMix TV World Fighters is Solid Snake's first crossover, fighting game appearance; his second is as a third-party entry in Super Smash Bros. Brawl for Nintendo's Wii console.&lt;br/&gt;    Moai&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hudson Soft characters:&lt;br/&gt;    White Bomberman (&amp;quot;Shirobon&amp;quot; in Japan)&lt;br/&gt;    Master Higgins (&amp;quot;Takahashi Meijin&amp;quot; in Japan)&lt;br/&gt;    Yūgo Ōgami&lt;br/&gt;    Momotarō (Momotarō Densetsu - Famicom 1987)&lt;br/&gt;    Sengoku Manjimaru (Tengai Makyō II: Manjimaru - PC Engine CD 1992).  Manjimaru was selectable in the 2D fighting game based on the Tengai Makyō series, Kabuki Klash (made available for both the Neo Geo MVS [arcade] and AES [home] systems).&lt;br/&gt;    Binbōgami (a.k.a. Bimbōgami or Bimbougami) (Momotarō Dentetsu - Famicom 1988;) Based on a Japanese spirit of poverty, Binbōgami served as an antagonist in the Momotarō Dentetsu series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Takara characters&lt;br/&gt;    Optimus Prime (Generation 1; &amp;quot;Convoy&amp;quot; in Japan).  His alternate palettes on the character select screen are Diaclone Powered Convoy, JAFCON Black Convoy, and Shining Ultra Magnus; all of these palettes are based on obscure action figure recolors released in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;    Tyson Granger (&amp;quot;Kinomiya Takao&amp;quot; in Japan)&lt;br/&gt;    Microman (w/ Robotman)&lt;br/&gt;    Robotman (who might be more commonly known as &amp;quot;Biotron&amp;quot; due to his frequent appearances as such in the U.S. Micronauts comic book), was scaled down to the size of an average human being and served as the main character's companion until being temporarily destroyed in the 27th issue of the aforementioned comic. Conversely, a Biotron toy identical to Takara's Robotman design&amp;mdash;released by Mego Corporation in 1976&amp;mdash;could double as multiple land vehicles and battle armor; it was large enough so that any 3 &amp;frac34;&amp;quot; Micronauts action figure could fit within the henshin robot's cockpit (located in its thoracic cavity).&lt;br/&gt;    Licca-chan (Japanese fashion doll)&lt;br/&gt;    Aska (COOL GIRL toyline)&lt;br/&gt;    Aska was one of two selectable characters in Konami's 3D action-adventure game, COOL GIRL&amp;mdash;retitled &amp;quot;Cy Girls&amp;quot; when localized for U.S./European markets to match the name of the toyline released by Takara's foreign distributor, BBi.&lt;br/&gt;    Megatron, his alternate palettes on the character select screen are Gun Robo MC12 Walther P38 (Grey Type; Megatron's original appearance in the New Microman: Micro Change toyline), Golden Megatron (possibly derived from the incredibly rare, 1998 Beast Wars Japan &amp;quot;Gold Megatron&amp;quot;), and the e-Hobby exclusive, Black Megatron; like Optimus, all of these palettes are based on obscure action figure recolors released in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;DreamMix TV World Fighters&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
