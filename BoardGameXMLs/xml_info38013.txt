							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lepanto</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;Card game for 2 players. Simulation of the Naval Battle of Lepanto 1571. Ottoman Turks vs The Holy League.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a custom deck of cards composed of Leader, Ship, Attack, Movement, and Scout cards. Each card has a Force value. Each turn the players fight a battle by revealing a set of cards which may consist of up to one Leader, four Ships, two Attack Cards, and two Movement Cards. The player with the higher total Force value wins the hand. Both players lose Strength Points equal to the total Force of the opponent&amp;rsquo;s cards. In addition, the loser of the hand also loses Strength Points equal to the difference between the two Force totals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 100 Strength Points. A player wins by having twice as many Strength Points as the opposing player at the end of a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
