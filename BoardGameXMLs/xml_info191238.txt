							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Punto 180</name>
									
			<description>It's year 1978 and in Italy on promulgate the law 180, which ratify the closing down of all psychiatric hospitals. &lt;br/&gt;The idea of the game is to remember and relive the atmosphere of this important period...&lt;br/&gt;Players identify themselves in a doctor releasing patients from their jails or in the severe guardians trying to repress this situation, moving the pieces on 8 different boards.&lt;br/&gt;There's just one doctor to free all the patients, but the guardians can use their superior number to overwhelm him, so move carefully and try to reach the exit with planning and strategy. &lt;br/&gt;Each board, representing original layout of real mental hospitals and asylums, is enriched by pictures of the author's photography-project &amp;quot;Persistenze&amp;quot;. &lt;br/&gt;Punto 180 is not just a game: it's a unique crossover and a way to let everybody know about a so important law, that had a worldwide impact and changed the life of many people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn players must move every active piece. &lt;br/&gt;The doctor move his white piece first, horizontally or vertically how many spaces as he likes. The patients (yellow pieces) start the game in their jails and the doctor must stop in an adjacent space to free them; once free, a patient moves the same way of the doctor and must exit the board reaching the yellow arrows. Every patient get out this way scores 1 point for the doctor's player. &lt;br/&gt;The guardians (black pieces) move again like the doctor, but can take the yellow pieces (the patients) moving on them. &lt;br/&gt;Each yellow pieces taken this way is removed from the board and scores 1 point for the guardians player. &lt;br/&gt;Important: a guardian can move on a patient only if black pieces has numerical superiority or tie on that line of the grid! Moreover, they can not overstep or jump the doctor white piece. &lt;br/&gt;The player with more points at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
