							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fighting Pit</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While both the Arena and this fighting pit roughly serve the same purpose, which is to showcase spectacular fights to an audience they are very different in just about any other way. While the arena is open to anyone this underground pit is only known to inaugurated members of the criminal underground and a few corrupt others with enough money to their name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the arena is open and well lit this fighting pit is hidden underground below a tavern serving as a cover operation and the only part well lit is the bloody sand at its center while the gallery for the spectators remains in a shady twilight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fights taking place here are quite different from those organized at the arena as well. While the fighters at the arena are usually skilled professionals that dazzle the audience with features of skill and strength the fights here are for the better part only bloody and brutal and the fighters often enough not here out of their own free will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pit is built into the ground below a tavern serving as a cover operation for it. The only entrance and exit is a flight of wooden stairs leading up to a hidden door in the taverns cellars. No stairs or the likes lead down to the floor of the fighting pit itself. Fighters either climb down the walls which are barely head high or are lowered into the pit with ropes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glow Orbs illuminate the pit, but very little of their light falls into the audience's gallery surrounding the pit, which is usually the way the averages spectator prefers it. A number of fine tables are arranged along the structures outer wall offering refreshments and expensive treats to the patrons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
