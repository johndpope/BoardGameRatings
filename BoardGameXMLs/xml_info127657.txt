							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mad Dash: Canyon Run</name>
									
			<description>The ultimate skill-based customizable runner! With over 5000 unique gear and skill combinations, discover your ultimate insane load-out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pazzo is a not-so-good bandit that has been left eating dust as the other members of the &amp;quot;Nine-o-Spades&amp;quot; gang have taken off with his share of the loot. Now he must chase them down as they continue their backstabbing ways. Pazzo has one advantage though... he is completely insane -giving him awesome powers to beat the looming challenges and catch those dastardly bandits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Give Pazzo an extra edge by equipping him with gear from the huge range available, each with their own unique benefits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hats (Colourful items with awesome benefits, but watch out that they don't fall off),&lt;br/&gt;Charms (mystical items that give Pazzo the edge that he needs),&lt;br/&gt;Parchments (super powerful items that give you awesome benefits for a single run).&lt;br/&gt;Encounter various hazards that each require an unique tactic to overcome: wild coyotes, deranged vultures, angry bulls, thunderous boulders, diabolical cacti and heaps more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by the off-beat style of classic spaghetti westerns, journey into the colorful (and mad) world of Pazzo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Original Music by award-winning composer Heath Brown, with tracks inspired by classic spaghetti western scores of the great Ennio Morricone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heaps of achievements and leaderboards so you can prove your mad skills to the world, along with Twitter and Facebook posting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eye popping graphics with full retina support on both iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. (This game is designed for high resolution displays, although the iPhone 3GS is supported, it is not optimal for gameplay.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With over 5000 gear and skill combinations, now you can choose your path to glory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
