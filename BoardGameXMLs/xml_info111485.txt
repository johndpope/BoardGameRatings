			<description>Foodle-Do!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Test your nutrition IQ with our fun new game Foodle! Learn important facts about the foods we eat to help you make better eating choices and see if your food knowledge of portion sizes, vitamins, fats and carbohydrates measures up! And don't forget the exercise when you land on a Foodle-Do space!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll the die at the beginning of each turn to determine how many spaces are &amp;quot;at stake&amp;quot; for the current question.  Whatever number is rolled is how many spaces that player's Pawn will move (forward or backward).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the die is thrown, the player to the right draws a Foodle Trivia Card from the box and reads it aloud.  Foodle questions are True/False or Multiple Choice, so you may get lucky with a guess, even if you don't know the correct answer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few of the spaces on the board are marked &amp;quot;Foodle-Do!&amp;quot;  If a player ends their turn on one of these spaces they immediately must perform the activity on their current Foodle-Do card.  When moving backward after missing a question, always stop on a Foodle-Do space.  Also treat the START space as a Foodle-Do space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time a player moves ahead into a new color, they should discard their current Foodle-Do card and draw a new one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to advance to the &amp;quot;Finish&amp;quot; space is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT THEY'LL LEARN: Portion Sizes, Nutritional Facts, Making Healthy Choices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
