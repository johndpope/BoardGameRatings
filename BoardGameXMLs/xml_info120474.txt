			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Head-to-head dogfights through four World Wars!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You walk onto the tarmac, weighing your options carefully...the bi-plane with its open cockpit where enemy's bullets mix with the rushing air in your face; or the life-sucking thrust of the heavily-armed fighter jet? You choose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evasive Action is the adrenaline-pumping one-on-one air combat game where your enemy is real - intelligent - unpredictable. You'll not only be flying at warp speed, you'll have to think at warp speed just to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forget flight simulation. This is seat-of-the-pants action with dogfights and stunts you can master without reading a manual the size of Detroit. Pick up your joystick and choose from four different time periods. From the open-air machine gun battles of WWI fighters, through dueling over the South Pacific in 1942, to the high-tech muscle jets of the 90s and beyond - into deep space, where thermostellar physics rule the cold void.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But just how hot a pilot are you? Can you put one down on a carrier deck? Can you take out enemy installations? Can you handle the white-knuckled fun of fearless flying? Evasive Action separates the top guns from the couch jockeys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Split screen action for single computer head-to-head play&lt;br/&gt;     Battle for control of the skies in WWI, WWII, WWIII, and WWIV modes&lt;br/&gt;     Arcade-style interface for spine-tingling excitement &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your cockpit clicks into place - twin 18,000 lb. turbos shoot your fighter forward, 1000 m.p.h. and accelerating. G-forces hit you like an angry Marine. Below you the desert is a blur. Suddenly there's a blip on your screen. Stay chilled. That MiG-29's locked onto your afterburners. Those smart heat-seekers can snuff you in a second. It's time for the ultimate challenge - it's time for Evasive Action!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
