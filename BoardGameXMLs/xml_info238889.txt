							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Tales of the Northlands: The Sagas of Noggin the Nog</name>
									
			<description>'In the lands of the North, where the Black Rocks stand guard against the cold sea, in the dark night that is very long the Men of the Northlands sit by their great log fires and they tell a tale... '&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So began each of the Sagas of Noggin the Nog, in which the crown of Noggin, Prince of the Nogs is sought by his wicked uncle Nogbad the Bad who devises evil plots to threaten the safety of the kingdom, in order to force Noggin to give up his crown. In this game, players are the noble Lords of the north, looking to assist Noggin however they can in his adventures with resources and wise council.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use their influence to take actions on the board which as a back drop is Peter Firmin's classic hand drawn map of the Northlands. The time taken on each action is plotted on a roundel which acts as the game clock, changes the turn order and progresses the seasons. However Nogbad is never far away from the source of the Kingdom's troubles and Noggin must use his cleverness, intuition and resourcefulness to thwart Nogbad and confirm his position as King of the Nogs. The game ends when Noggin secures the crown or if Nogbad manages to get there first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Sagas of Noggin the Nog, players must work together to successfully complete the adventures revealed by the saga cards which occur each season. By offering much needed resources and making key decisions that effect the progress of the adventures, players will, if successful add to Noggin's popularity. Should their decision be unwise or they take too long the popular vote might sway toward Nogbad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game will include all of the characters from the TV series, Noggin, his Queen Nooka, Knut their son, Thor Nogson the grumpy Captain of the Royal Guard, Graculus the Great Green Bird, Olaf the Lofty, the Court inventor, and Romf, the little man from the Hot Water Valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These adventures are all based upon the books and stories developed by Oliver Postgate &amp;amp; Peter Firmin. The game is fully licensed has access to all artwork previously released in books and film and includes over 50 new pieces of new artwork commissioned from Peter Firmin specifically for the game. The game has three levels, solo, a family game with simplified rule set and a gamer's version with deeper strategy options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
