							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">144: Champions of Hope</name>
									
			<description>144: Champions of Hope is a blend of Euro-Victory Point Race and Theme-Heavy Ameritrash strategy game for 2-4 players. Set in the world of Traesparin, the setting for the novels 144: Wrath and 144: Redemption, players take on the role of Champions to expand, build, and battle their way into legend. Recruit fearless Heroes and discover powerful Artifacts as you amass your forces. Will you master arcane magic or win through the strength of steel? Champions can even join together to take on greater threats as they vie for the most Glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start the game with two Lands under their control. Each turn, the controlling Champion (the player whose turn it is) rolls a ten-sided die for Production. The result of the role is compared to their Lands and Resources are acquired by all players accordingly. The controlling Champion can then use acquired Resources to expand to new Lands (thereby increasing their Resource production), recruit Heroes (cards) to increase their Magic and/or Combat power, improve their land with Tower Upgrades that add to the Production roll's result, or purchase Artifacts (cards) that give Glory and additional passive or active benefits. Additionally, players may undertake secret Quests that provide Glory, primarily, at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main source of Glory, however, is Battle. The controlling Champion will end his or her turn with the option of sending forces into Battle, challenging their choice of Rank 1-5. In Battle, Champions must choose whether they will fight with the strength of Combat or the power of Magic. The chosen Battle Rank card is turned over and the controlling Champion faces the challenge by rolling a ten-sided die and adding their chosen power. If the result exceeds the target, they win and receive both Glory and Reward (in the form of Resources). If they lose, Glory is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the controlling Champion may solicit aid from another player before the Battle begins. Players can combine their powers to take on greater threats (and earn greater Glory) than they could on their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End game is triggered when a player reaches 144 Glory (tracked around the edge of the game board). Points from Quest cards and remaining Resources are added in to determine the player with the most Glory, the Champion of Hope!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
