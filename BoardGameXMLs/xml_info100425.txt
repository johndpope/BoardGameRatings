			<description>Red Baron is a low complexity, quick playing board game of World War I air combat. This is not an aerial combat simulation by any means. It is a relatively simple &amp;quot;beer &amp;amp; pretzels&amp;quot; game in which the players use cards to fly their fighters, bombers, and balloons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is two-dimensional (no altitude considerations) and features three aircraft types (fighters, bombers and balloons). Players use cards to maneuver their aircraft (one per card play) with the aim of collecting victory points by shooting down enemy aircraft, bombing ground targets (with bombers) or conducting aerial observation over no man's land (with balloons). The players each start with six aircraft but can vary the assortment in an effort to pursue differing victory strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes packaged in a ziploc bag that contains the 11&amp;quot; by 17&amp;quot; card-stock (unmounted) board, 38  playing pieces (counters), 28 cards and 4 pages of rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
