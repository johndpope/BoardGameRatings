			<description>Hostile Takeover is a strategic game for two players. You are a shareholder of a company and you can move executives, managers and workers. The aim of the game is to make the workers of your opponent yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 7x7 tile grid. Each player begins with eleven workers (large sized disks), seven managers (medium sized disks) and four executives (small sized disks). Pieces can move independently but managers must always be place on top of a worker and executives must always be placed on top of a manager. The color of the disk on top determines which player owns the piece; the size of the lowest disk moved determines the possible move. Workers move one space orthogonally, managers move one space diagonally, and executives can move one space in any direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to control six of the opponent's workers, while still controlling six of their own, controls more than half of the workers on the board and has pulled off a &amp;quot;hostile takeover&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with some extra or specially marked components allowing for more different games to be played with the same set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
