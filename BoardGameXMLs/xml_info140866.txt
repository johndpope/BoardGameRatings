							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Task of Ezrok</name>
									
			<description>The Task of Ezrok is a solitaire card game with a heroic fantasy theme. Adventurers in the world of Ezrok love their leathers &amp;amp; fur, and various factions of druids are everywhere; some good, some not so good. The following paragraph describes the undertaking that is at the heart of the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Chest of Seth has found its way into the heartland kingdoms. Fortunately, king Morem has ordered the destruction of this evil relic. Your aim is to oversee Ezrok and his companions as they transport the chest far away from civilization. This task will take you through the Swamps of the Black Dragon, the Hills of Vorkin, and deep into an icy wasteland where the chest must be destroyed in the Eternal Chasm&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game uses a tile laying system to move Ezrok and his companions across the different regions toward their goal. The cards are progressively laid face up until nine rows of tiles are created. It is after this point that Ezrok can arrive at the Eternal Chasm to destroy the chest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Task of Ezrok includes 108 tile cards which offer a variety of encounters and obstacles. Also included are 8 history cards (enrichment material), 10 miscellaneous cards (playing aids, etc.), a pawn, and all the dice needed for tracking resource points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
