							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Forgotten Heroes: Sorcerer</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forgotten Heroes: Sorcerer follows Paladin as the second class sourcebook from Malladin&amp;rsquo;s Gate Press in the Forgotten Heroes line. Forgotten Heroes is dedicated to developing the less fashionable classes that are often ignored by other publishers. As sorcerers are a new class to the D20 system, they are often overlooked as being merely an alternative spellcasting mechanic to the more traditional &amp;lsquo;Vancian&amp;rsquo; mechanic of the wizard class. As such, many supplements have been written for wizards, and indeed much of the material supplied, such as spells and other magic-related rules, can be used just as easily by the sorcerer class. However, we believe that this approach does the sorcerer a great disservice. The sorcerer class has a unique flavour of its own, that has been long overlooked. The sorcerer stands apart from the wizard in their approach not only to magic, but to life itself. The sorcerer is one of the true heroes of the fantasy genre. They are gifted and thrust into a&lt;br/&gt;life of adventure by virtue of their destiny. Wizards, on the other hand, will most likely have chosen a life of adventure in order to further their learning and understanding of magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
