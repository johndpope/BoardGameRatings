			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OGL Alternatives: Alternate Advancement System provides Gamemasters with an alternate method for calculating advancement that is both easy and fun to use. Designed with flexibility in mind, AAS gives the individual GM the means to reward only those aspects of the gaming session that he wishes to emphasize, and then only use those aspects to advance characters towards their next character level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product also provides details on how to convert from a standard XP-based game to an AAS-based game, how to convert Session Points into Experience Points and vice versa, notes on individual awards versus group awards, notes on using the system without giving up the traditional XP Table, and even includes a lengthy example of the advancement system in use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fully-bookmarked roleplaying product offers discerning Gamemasters a powerful tool for bringing the fun back to character advancement. Though geared towards D20-based gaming systems, AAS is easily applicable to any level-based roleplaying game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
