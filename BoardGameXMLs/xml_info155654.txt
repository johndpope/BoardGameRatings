			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ravenor, last stop on the Crysamar River trade route and first stop on the road to adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trading season has begun and the town of Ravenor is filled with merchants and celebrators looking to enjoy the upcoming Spring Festival. But not all is well in the capital of Crysamar Vale. Tremors rumble through the land, damaging buildings, and fisherman complain that the fish are becoming scarce. And during quiet moments, when the fires burn low and most revelers have long since gone to bed, the rumors grow darker. Tales are whispered of bloodless bodies being found in the streets at dawn, of boats drifting down river in the morning mist, their crews gone, and of strange smells and sounds that make the blood of even the hardiest soul run cold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something dreadful has come to Ravenor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catacombs of Chaos is a Labyrinth Lord adventure for characters of 1st to 3rd level. In Catacombs of Chaos, the characters are plunged into an adventure in, and beneath, the town of Ravenor as they attempt to unravel the mystery of the town&amp;rsquo;s recent troubles. The adventure can be played independently or as the perfect launching point for a new campaign. The product includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Complete Background and Start information,&lt;br/&gt;     a Map of the Catacombs,&lt;br/&gt;     over 50 Encounters,&lt;br/&gt;     more than 20 possible Objectives,&lt;br/&gt;     New Monsters, New Villains and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, Catacombs of Chaos includes The Ongoing Campaign, a section in each Fantastic Adventures product that provides the Game Master with the information they need to link adventures together into an ongoing campaign. Look for the CV for other adventures in the Crysamar Vale and the Fantastic Adventures logo for more products in the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will your characters discover the source of the deaths and disappearances in the town of Ravenor or will they fall among the old bones and dust that litter the Catacombs of Chaos?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
