			<description>In Rule of Alchemist each player is an alchemist trying to complete magic scrolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each scroll needs different color combinations of five jewels to be completed. Players have jewels hidden behind paper fences and at the end of each turn check if they have completed a scroll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn players may use their job skill (if they didn't use it the turn before) and must exchange two jewels with the public pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A round ends when there is only one card left in the scroll deck for the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scrolls award coins, at the end of the third round, the player who has more coins wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
