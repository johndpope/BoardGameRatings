			<description>Most men only distinguish among 11 basic colours (mango, lemon, mandarin, pistachio et al are things you eat, not colours. Oranges are a mere coincidence with the colour).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rainbow++++ is a fast-paced card game where you must play at least one of each of the 11 possible colours in order to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each colour has a unique special ability that can be good or bad and there is a universal special ability that says that any two played cards of the same colour act as a trump card of the colour of your choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cunning player will carefully choose the sequence of cards to be played as a combo and try to avoid to play cards with a negative special ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
