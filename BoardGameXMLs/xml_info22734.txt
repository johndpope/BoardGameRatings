			<description>&amp;quot;The cardgame your mother should have warned you about!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tank Vixens is a collectible card game based on the comic book of the same name.   This is not your typical CCG, it is definitely adults only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 106 cards which you use to assemble a play deck with a minimum of 40 cards.  Each player requires their own set of cards.  There are 6 types of cards: Characters, Minions, Tops, Tails, Props and Events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Characters &amp;quot;attack&amp;quot; by posing, and each Character's posing value can be boosted by equipping them with clothing (Tops, such as &amp;quot;Wet T-Shirt&amp;quot;, Tails, such as &amp;quot;PVC Stockings&amp;quot;, and Props, such as &amp;quot;Cucumbers&amp;quot;).  The sexier the outfit, the more impressive (and thus powerful) their pose.  Event cards (such as &amp;quot;Mom Finds Your Diary&amp;quot;) can be used to boost your own stats or penalize your opponents, and Minion cards (such as &amp;quot;FanBoy&amp;quot;) can be sacrificed to prevent damage or gain bonuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
