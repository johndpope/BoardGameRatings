			<description>A game played with Icehouse pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* 10 stashes of Icehouse pieces, in all of the different colors that are available as of the date of this revision (black, purple, blue, cyan, green, yellow, orange, red, clear, and white)&lt;br/&gt;    * 2 ten-sided dice (preferably ones with single-digit faces rather than the &amp;ldquo;tens&amp;rdquo; faces)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game of controlled chaos, the players compete to capture all ten colors of pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to capture one each of all ten colors of pieces by pointing attackers at defenders (which are much like the attackers and defenders in Icehouse) in one of the four colors that each color of attacker is able to attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever an attacker is placed such that it points at a defender in one of the four colors that the attacker is able to attack, the player who placed that attacker captures a piece corresponding to the color of the defender by taking the largest available piece of that color from the linear array of pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player has successfully captured one piece in each of the ten colors of pieces. That player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
