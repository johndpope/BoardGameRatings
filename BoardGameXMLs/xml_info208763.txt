			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creatures and Cryptids of the Wild North!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Monsters: North America brings you an amazing and exciting assortment of monsters from the legends and lore of North America, from ancient aboriginal adversaries and spirits of the land to more modern cryptids and mysterious beasts, ranging from CR 3 to 21. Some natives of North America are benevolent spirits, like the stately and mighty manitou, and the curious wakandagi the purifies the lakes and rivers, each guiding and guarding those who travel their lands. Others simply prefer to be left alone, like the shy and secretive sasquatch or the mysterious and magical tupilaq, or prowl the wilderness proud and alone, daring any to challenge them like the hungry hodag and the majestic thunderbird. Many more, however, are far more sinister, whether cunning and cruel like the murderous wikkawak or simply savage like the snallygaster. Sinister and jealous tricksters like the shapeshifting ijiraq and the child-stealing qallupilluk hunt those that wander the wilds, making them lose their way and fall into their dread clutches, while others inspire such dread and terror that they have no need of trickery, from the titanic akhlut wolf-whale, the ominous Jersey devil, and the flesh-feasting wendigo! As if a dozen existing monsters were not enough, the brand-new giiwedin is tormented spirit of the northern winds, a horrid howling gale of doom that can raise an army of the frozen dead in its wake. In addition to the featured creatures, we bring you a brand new kind of magic item with scrimshaw magic graven into the bones of the beasts of the north!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
