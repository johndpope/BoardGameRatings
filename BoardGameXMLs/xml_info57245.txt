			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter the world of Hahlmabrea, where culture dictates behavior and the Council of Hahlmabrea guides Adventurers through adventuring. Grab your Permit for Adventuring or Adventuring License and head out to explore the vast and fascinating world of Hahlmabrea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game of Hahlmabrea offers a complete, easy-to-use system for role players who want less hassle and more enjoyment out of their gaming sessions. Players or Adventurers are free to experiment with character concepts and role playing, for the only rules imposed on the players are that of the culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple, complete combat system and a user-definable spell system allow a great deal of flexibility in game play, yet the GM can still retain control and even participate in an adventure. Adventuring is a profession, and while there are some exceptions, Licensed Adventurers are generally respected. A full year of Adventuring must be completed in order to become a Licensed Adventurer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Kalek, a hill dwarf from the Kremp Mountains, had participated in many adventures, but when the Council of Hahlmabrea summoned him to their chambers, he felt a shiver run down his spine. The other members of Davoce, his adventuring group, also seemed edgy, for rumours had been circulating around the city about the terror of the Demon Mountains: a behemoth. A major threat to the land had surfaced, and Kalek knew that this adventure would have far-reaching consequences. Squaring his shoulders, taking a deep breath, and bowing to the Dukirri, Kalek entered the Council Chambers....&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hahlmabrea offers:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A smooth-flowing Adventurer Generation system that allows players to come up with a character concept and follow it through consistently. No specific die rolls are required to become any type of Adventurer you desire. There are 14 different Folk to choose from, each with a unique history and quirks that players can embellish upon within their character concept.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complex Adventurer Generation format that assures players a consistent character concept that will last many adventures. All of the necessary die rolls are generated during this process, so few calculations are done during game play. This reduces the frustration and anxiety caused by interrupting game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A spell system, based on linguistics, allows players to distort the interpretation of each spell, custom-tailoring the spell language to fit any situation. The spells are naturally-based, and they are intended to enhance and improve role play, not combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
