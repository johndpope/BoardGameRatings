			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob strode confidently down the hallway, quickly glancing in each direction. Bathrooms on the left, server room on the right. Perfect. He had maybe five minutes before the sales manager missed him in the conference room. Ducking to the right, he slipped into the printer room unseen. As he had expected, the door to the company's server room was locked. Fortunately, the noise of the loud printer equipment would block the sound of his lockpick gun. He checked one last time to make sure he was alone, then pulled the device from his jacket pocket. The pick slipped easily into the lock, and he squeezed the trigger. Abruptly, the door opened from the inside, bringing him face to face with a surprised and slightly discheveled security guard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where do you go from here? To the battle map, of course! If you need a map of a modern structure, you need Modern Floorplans. The Modern Floorplans series from Fabled Environments and 12 to Midnight offers gamers high quality maps in a variety of configurations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Want to draw it out yourself? Use the 8.5&amp;times;11 map as a guide.&lt;br/&gt;     Want to simply drop the map on the table and play? Use either the 24&amp;times;36 full map (if you have access to a plotter printer) or print the tiled version on regular paper and assemble a full-size version yourself in a matter of minutes. Both versions are scaled at 1 inch equals 5 feet.&lt;br/&gt;     In addition, each floorplan also comes in versions without room labels and without furniture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: All floorplans are rendered in black and white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All maps are created by an architectural drafter using AutoCAD. This gives all of the maps the realistic feel that your players crave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Average High-Rise Strip Mall Office Building&lt;br/&gt;KLG Limited - This structure was originally designed as a large upscale interior design office. However, the versatility of this floorplan lends itself to a variety of uses. Ideally, this structure would house a small to medium size company in a large strip mall, industrial park/office park, or serve as an independent structure. This building could hold a variety of professional businesses, such as an IT company, financial consulting firm, or law office. This building could also serve as the financial aid or other administrative offices for a college or university.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The maps in this title can also be found in Modern Floorplans Volume 1: Office Spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
