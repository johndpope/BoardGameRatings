			<description>From the cassette inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You control KLP-2 (Klepto) a wayward Meknotech droid assigned to deactivate hostile alien droids which inhabit the underground city of Quazatron on the planet Quartech. You must destroy the alien droids by laser fire, by pushing them off their programmed routes to destruction, or by ramming them (providing you are stronger than they are).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KLP-2 has a prototype Grapple device enabling the alien robots to be stopped and dismantled. The parts recovered from the aliens can be added to KLP-2 to extend his facilities and endurance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The alien computer system can be tapped to provide maps of the various levels and obtain data on the alien droids and their constituent parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
