							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blitz: The Air Raid Game</name>
									
			<description>Blitz is played on a board with 60 squares.  Each squares represents a property or building such as railway stations, shops, etc.  Each property has a value as marked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four center squares in the board are not marked and are used to start the game. The game is played with 60 bombs (red on one end and black on the other).  To start the game 4 bombs (2 red end up and 2 black end up) are placed in the center four squares diagonally opposite each other.  The attacker (using the red end) places a red bomb on any square where it will bracket a black bomb between it and a red bomb already on the map.  When he does this he flips the black bomb over to red.  The defender (using black) does the same with his black bomb, being sure to bracket a red bomb with his black.   If a player is unable to find a legal place he loses his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues alternately until all 60 squares are filled.    At that point the bombs are removed and the points on the squares underneath are totaled up.  The high points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
