			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        UNAUTHORIZED PRODUCTION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         The information that BGG has on this item indicates that Эй! Это моя рыба! is a non-authorized version of Hey, That's My Fish!.  According to designer Günter Cornett, Zvezda issued this game without credit to him nor Alvydas Jakeliunas, thus it is set apart from the official entry of Hey, That's My Fish!.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players catch fish by moving penguins around the play areas, claiming fish tile they leave at the start of their turn.  Pieces must move in a straight line and cannot cross voids, and thus the game board becomes smaller and the options fewer as the game progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This edition has fewer penguins than the original (13 each instead of 16) and adds a shark figure that moves according to a die roll and a six-point compass printed on a board. A player loses a fish whenever one of their penguins encounters the shark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
