							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dreadball: Season 4</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do you exceed the spectacle of DreadBall Ultimate? That was the question that the DGB asked themselves ahead of the new season of DreadBall, and it turned out that there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any one answer, so they decided to include them all! New teams, new MVPs, new coaching staff and a whole new set of rules mean that this isn&amp;rsquo;t an update &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s a whole new era for the greatest sporting spectacle in the galaxy! While the new guys find their feet on the neodurium, the old guard find that they have to re-evaluate their tactics to take advantage of new rules and rewards that fundamentally alter the flow of the game. Coaching assistants can make or break a game, and there&amp;rsquo;s always the possibility of a fan or two getting more directly involved in proceedings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The message to every player in the league is clear &amp;ndash; go big or go home!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;48 Page A4 Full Colour Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;    Stats and background for four new teams &amp;ndash; the Sphyr, the Rebs, the Hobgoblins and the Brokkrs.&lt;br/&gt;    Stats and background for 7 famous MVPs&lt;br/&gt;    Expanded rules for Fans, Coaches and Cheerleaders&lt;br/&gt;    A new achievement system to push your players a step further&lt;br/&gt;    A host of new abilities to add to your games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
