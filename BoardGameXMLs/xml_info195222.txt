			<description>Embark on a breathtakingly exciting expedition to a distant world and venture into uncharted territory. When on a faraway planet, total destruction threatens all! Some places are best left alone even if the latest technology makes visits to remote parts of the universe a possibility. Discover what lies at the far end of the universe and plan your escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join Elizabeth Campton and her close colleague Steve on a routine voyage that turns into an intergalactic space adventure. As an exobiologist and space explorer, Elizabeth is no stranger to danger. Still, she encounters more lethal threats than she anticipated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Her troubles would have been impossible to face without her dear friend Steve by her side. From bad weather, to emergency ship repairs, to landing in jail, to healing a princess &amp;ndash; Elizabeth becomes entangled in one life-threatening situation after another. Then, matters become worse!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A comet is on a collision course with the planet! Every form of life is in grave danger. Elizabeth gains permission to visit a forbidden deserted city. There she finds a ship that can transport everyone to safety, but the old vessels in disrepair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must do what it takes to save the world from total destruction! In a new dimension where the future, past and present intertwine, only your skill and cunning can bring you back home alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
