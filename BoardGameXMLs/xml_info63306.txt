			<description>The first four Psi cards are available through the Bunny Blanks. Other Psi cards are distributed at conventions, bunny promotions and special bunny events. Some cards are distributed when you buy your game through Playroom Entertainment or from select retailers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spider Bunny&lt;br/&gt;Psi 01: Blue Kite. May be used once to eliminate either Carrot Thief, Pilfer The Pawn, Zodiac Thief, Pumpkin Ridge or Pinch Your Place. Or may be used once to keep one player&amp;rsquo;s bunnies in place during a Shockwave. May be used at any time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bunny Eye For The Carrot Guy&lt;br/&gt;Psi 02: Yellow Arrow. Roll the dice. The player who is wearing the most clothing of the highest color rolled may Choose A Carrot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shazbot!&lt;br/&gt;Psi 03: Violet Arrow. May be used on any player. The player must return one Carrot to Kaballa&amp;rsquo;s Market for each curse (or naughty) word that he speaks during the game. A player may pay 10 Dolla to remove this card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After Darkness&lt;br/&gt;Psi 04: Green Kite. May be used once by a player to eliminate any 50/50 Weapon at any time after sunset or before sunrise. May be used at any time (during the game)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pucker Up&lt;br/&gt;Psi 05:  Red Kite. All opponents roll a 12-sided die. The opponent who rolled the lowest number must either kiss the player or give up one Carrot, Zodiac and Mysterious Place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hitchbunny&amp;rsquo;s Guide&lt;br/&gt;Psi 06: Orange Arrow. Roll all of the dice. For every combination of a 4 and a 2 the player may take any card with the planet Jupiter from the discard and use it immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Xavi-Hare&lt;br/&gt;Psi 07: Blue Arrow. May be used once by a player to predict who will launch the next weapon and who will choose the next Carrot. If correct, the player will control the target bunny for the weapon and take the Carrot for himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meteor Rocks&lt;br/&gt;Psi 08: Yellow Kite. May be placed on any Super Bunny in The Bunny Circle which loses all of its &amp;rsquo;special features&amp;rsquo; and becomes a regular bunny of the same color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horton Hates A Who&lt;br/&gt;Psi 09: Red Arrow. Horton Hates A Who may be given to any player who must give an opponent one of his Carrots every time that he says the word, 'Who'.  Horton Hates A Who is discarded if or when the player has given each of his opponents one Carrot.  The player may pay 10 Dolla to remove this card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bunnies The Gathering&lt;br/&gt;Psi 10: Green Arrow. May be used once by a player to &amp;lsquo;pat&amp;rsquo; six bunnies in The Bunny Circle (one each of the six colors shown). The player must &amp;lsquo;un-pat&amp;rsquo; one bunny at the start of each turn until they are all back. Patted bunnies may not play Aggressive cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Indiana Clones&lt;br/&gt;Psi 11: Violet Kite. May be used once by a player to discard his entire five-card hand and replace it with any five Weapon cards from Rooney&amp;rsquo;s Weapons Emporium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psi Corps&lt;br/&gt;Psi 12: Orange Kite. The player with this card saved may control all Psi cards used by any opponents. If at any time the player has no bunnies in The Bunny Circle then Psi Corps is discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
