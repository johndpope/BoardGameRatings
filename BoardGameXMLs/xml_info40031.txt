			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Independence! is a strategy game for 3-5 Players, who compete as Colonial Governors during the American revolution. A game is comprised of three years, and each year Players select a new Colony to govern. There are two turns in each year; six turns in a complete game (or 5 turns in a short game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Independence! is based on historical facts about the 13 original colonies, and the major events of that time period. However, the wide variety of Player choices and random events cause each game of Independence! to develop differently.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
