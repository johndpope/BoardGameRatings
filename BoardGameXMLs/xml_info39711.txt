			<description>Players are moving through the Styrian Volcano-Land (a small area in the south-east of Austria) trying to buy all items on their shopping lists. This isn&amp;rsquo;t too easy since regional distributors don&amp;rsquo;t have everything and don&amp;rsquo;t have too much in stock. So sometimes it is necessary to visit a Supermarket. There it even might be cheaper but the money spent is out of the game. Money used to buy at local producers could boomerang back to the players and remains in the game. At the end of the game (two to three rounds) players check whether there is more money in the region or outside (the game). If latter one happens, all players lose together. If there&amp;rsquo;s more money in the region (on the game board) the player with the most money wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
