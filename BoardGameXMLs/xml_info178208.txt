							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zonga: The Epic Zombie Conga Line Showdown of Ultimate Destiny of the Apocalypse</name>
									
			<description>In a post-apocalyptic world where Zombies are bored, two teams of Zombies face off for the annual Epic Conga Line Showdown of Ultimate Destiny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two teams of Zombies will be positioning themselves to create a conga line...the zombies will need to move wisely as their opponents line may cut them off, and they'll need to address their hunger for brains by picking up some while they conga!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players place one of their Zombies onto a 6x7 board starting from the bottom row. Each slot on the 6x7 board either gives brains, or takes away brains. The first time a player places their Zombie into a new row, it costs them brains. The first player to have four Zombies in a row, wins. The board changes every game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
