							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Narvik, Europa play aids kit 3</name>
									
			<description>(from the back cover:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This kit was designed for use with Narvik, 2nd edition, revised. You will not be able to use this kit with the 1st edition of Narvik. You will be able to use it with the 2nd edition Narvik with the following changes: At the bottom of map 10A you should add the range notation G-13 to hexes 5114 and 5115. Also add an airfield adjacent to the port of Kristansand on hex 4415.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is important to remember that you must add the printed number of the range hexes to Bomber Command, Hatston Field, the off map Danish airfield and Germany when figuring total range with the air distance chart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Invasion Planning Chart is provided to aid the German player in the initial and follow-up waves. It can also be used by the Allies for their counter-landings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The various tactical area charts are provided to allow for an expanded view of each victory point port. I have found that counter density around these ports can create problems, so the enlarged maps are provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONTENTS:&lt;br/&gt;This Kit contains the following components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two - 50% reduction Europa Maps, I0A and 5B&lt;br/&gt;ONE - Rail and Air Distance Chart&lt;br/&gt;ONE - Invasion Planning Chart&lt;br/&gt;ONE - Off Map Air Display Chart&lt;br/&gt;ONE - Terrain Key and Tactical Display Port Chart, NARVIK&lt;br/&gt;ONE - Tactical Display Port Chart, NAMSOS, TRONDHIEM &amp;amp; ANDALSNES&lt;br/&gt;ONE - Tactical Display Port Chart, BURGEN, HAUGESUND, STAVANGER &amp;amp; KRISTIANSAND&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
