							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dogs of War: Legends of the Crushed Planes</name>
									
			<description>Dogs of War is a wargame using 22mm miniatures to form together into squads that take to the battlefield and wage war on each other. The game has a rich history and setting with unique races and models. During each round of play, a player can move his or her squads, strike and shoot at enemy squads and even cast magic designed to help you and hinder allies. Various scenarios exist in the game that will define goals for the game, time limits and other details. There is even, in development, a campaign set of rules that will be designed directly into the core set of rules. Each race has it's own set of special rules and squad lists with attributed points values to make the game a &amp;quot;fair fight.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as one of several races for dominion and survival in the crushed planes. Play as the Ng'Awuthii, otherwise known as the Ng to foreign races, an advanced race of humanoids who possess technology far surpassing the technology of all other races combined. Or play as the talwart Tuskers, tribes of wise and savage nobility who use their heavy weaponry, tough skin and rending tusks to demolish their foes. Play as these, or several other races including the beautiful Eduran people who wield powerful magic and fight with inhuman grace, or the infamous Nameless, insect kin who travel above-ground in a pupal state which appear kin to dwarves of mythology or even the Kingdoms of Man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
