			<description>In this exciting game of swashbuckling piracy, each player controls a band of swarthy pirates raiding a heavily fortified island. Players must compete against one another as well as against the island itself, which is firing wildly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses one of the eight different Ships to command, which indicates the Crew, Artillery, Ammunition, Speed, and Hull. Players can board enemy pirate ships, fire cannons, and fight the winds as they maneuver their ships around the island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players win only after the island's defense have been destroyed and each other player has been eliminated, either through destroying the ship or killing the entire crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
