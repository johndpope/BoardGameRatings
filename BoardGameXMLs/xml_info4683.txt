			<description>Armor at Kursk - Battle of Prochorovka, covers the largest single tank battle in the history of warfare. Approximately 1400 tanks and assault guns met head to head near the town of Prochorovka, in a battle that became a desperate close range shoot-out which would decide the ultimate sucess or failure of Operation Zitadelle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2nd SS Panzer Korps began it's attack on July 3rd, and spent the next 8 days breaking through the dense Russian defensive positions. During the late afternoon and evening of the 11th, they broke through and replused a counterattack by the Russian 31st Tank Corps. Reorganizing during the night, the panzers struck northward before dawn on the 12th. As dawn broke, the lead German elements ran head-on into the lead elements of the Soviet 5th Gaurds Tank Army and the battle was on. It was to last all day, in confused and savage fighting at close ranges. In the end, the Russians were driven back from the town, but the Germans were unable to push them any further. Losses exceeded three hundred tanks on each side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was first published as one of the Task Force Games Pocket Games.  It was later released in a boxed version with the name on the cover shortened to Armor at Kursk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units are German Battalions and Russian Regiments &amp;amp; Brigades, though all are similar in size and manpower. Hexes are 400 meters across, turns represent one hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
