			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Naval Ops: Warship Gunner is a turn based naval simulation war game. You start out commanding a World War II German, British, Japanese or American destroyer, but find yourself in the midst of an electrical storm which creates a vortex to a parallel universe. The two major forces of this parallel world, The Freedom Forces and the Empire, are entangled in an all out war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Siding yourself with the Freedom Forces you have to take on 40 missions of increasing difficulty against the Empire. At the end of every tenth mission you have to confront and destroy a powerful boss, including a huge super plane and an almost invincible super submarine. At the end of every mission you gain money and points. The former can be used to buy parts or invest in the development of five technological areas: Metallurgy, engines, weapons, aircraft and electronics. The latter can be used to purchase crew promotions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You do have the opportunity to change, modify or even build and customize your very own ship. Alternative ships include the Cruiser, the Battleship, the Aircraft Carrier and the Battlecarrier. There are hundreds of available parts and weapons, both conventional and unconventional such as lasers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Naval Ops: Warship Gunner is an overall very interesting and addictive game which is bound to keep you sitting at the edge of your seat for long hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
