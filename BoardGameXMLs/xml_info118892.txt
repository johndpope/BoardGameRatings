			<description>Winning Run is a video game, released by Namco in 1988. It was the first game to use the Namco System 21 hardware. The music was composed by Hiroyuki Kawada. It was housed in a movable (silver, orange) cabinet. In traditional NAMCO racer genre of the time it the player had a choice of game modes to play: Easy Drive (Automatic Transmission and slower game play) Technical Drive (Manual Transmission and faster game play) The game also featured a Dunlop &amp;quot;style&amp;quot; tire bridge over the track but instead said &amp;quot;NAMCO&amp;quot; on it. The music had similarities to Namco's Final Lap using the short jingles when the race started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Winning Run&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
