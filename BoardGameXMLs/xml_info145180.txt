							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bad Machine</name>
									
			<description>From the author, Dan &amp;quot;Inky&amp;quot; Shiovitz:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bad Machine is a text-based work of interactive fiction, set in an unusual future. The protagonist is a member of a collective of mechanical entities completely controlled by a central Queen &amp;mdash; but as the game opens an unexpected failure in the protagonist's internal programming offers some chance at autonomy. This piece makes extensive use of unusual text presentation to show the protagonist's non-standard viewpoint. Learning to understand the text is a large part of the playing experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
