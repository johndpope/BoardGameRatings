							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Auxiliary Airfield</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set up well out of range of enemy bombers this small auxiliary airfield is nothing more then a number of relatively flat pastures with the fences originally separating them and all other obstacles removed. Still the ground is relatively soft making the airfield fit only for some of the lighter fighter planes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a matter of fact, as most of their missions are short interception missions on even shorter notice, the pilots take of with half empty fuel tanks more often than not. To spare their unprotected runway as well as to gain a slight edge in the heated dogfights they have to expect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The air force has not made much of an effort to provide more than the most basic facilities to this site. Most planes sit out in the open, getting refueled and resupplied on the meadows as soon as they roll out after landing. Only if one of the interceptors suffers damage will it stay on the ground until it can be moved to the corrugated iron shelter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pilots and their service crew are housed in a number of tents at one end of the grassy runway. The tent of the on-duty officer can be told apart from the others by the distinguishing radio antenna sticking out from its top. No other structures are to be found here and even these few have been painted in camouflage patterns, not unlike the planes, to make the airfield seem like any other meadow in its neighborhood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lack of even the most basic amenities at this site is hard on the crew, possibly as much as their regular sorties. But although the airfield should theoretically out of range for any enemy bomber wanting to return home no one wants to give away this relatively save installation by any building not strictly necessary for its operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
