							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Drought Hawk</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wherever water sources have dried, plants are withered, and the heat of the sun becomes unbearable, the Drought Hawks to flourish. Their hideous forms and bloodshot are stark reminders that local wildlife is just as dangerous as dehydration itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commoners consider them blights on the landscape, cursed beasts which drains moisture from the earth as their numbers grow. Most wise men and soothsayers dismiss this as nonsense, but even they acknowledge that Drought Hawks are a sign of arid days to come. All agree that individual Hawks should be attacked on sight, as they attract persistent flocks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These featherless, dwarf-sized birds are often found in dry or desert climates. Players can identify them quickly by their yellow leathery skin, bloodshot eyes, and impressive wingspan resembling that of a small dragon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drought Hawks have a seemingly unnatural sense for when droughts are settling into a region. They tend to migrate to a community just before or at the cusp of disaster, seeking out weak and dehydrated targets. While typically scavengers, they become surprisingly bold in the company of other Drought Hawks. Once most defenseless targets are killed or have fled a region, Drought Hawks form flocks that hunt targets within their combined challenge rating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
