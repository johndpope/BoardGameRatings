			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Grab your sword, buckle up your armor and memorize your healing spells, because its time to play Mazes &amp;amp; Perils Core Rules. M&amp;amp;P is a not a &amp;ldquo;clone&amp;rdquo;, but more of a fantasy rpg game inspired by the rules put together by the late Dr. John Eric Holmes in the late &amp;rsquo;70s of a very popular roleplaying game. This book also provides a look of where it could have gone if allowed, giving you even more levels, going to level 12. So sit back, relax and grab your dice as you will be playing old school rules, Mazes &amp;amp; Perils!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;MAZES &amp;amp; PERILS is a game of role playing in a fantasy world, suitable for ages 10 and up. To play, you need only this rulebook, some dice, paper, pencils, a few friends, and your imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have played other fantasy role playing games, the MAZES &amp;amp; PERILS rules may feel familiar to you.  Inspired by the 1977 &amp;ldquo;Holmes&amp;rdquo; version of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular role playing game,   MAZES &amp;amp; PERILS goes beyond the introduction provided by the Holmes version, allowing for longer-term campaigns. Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t need another standalone fantasy role playing game, you may find a few useful new ideas herein that you can use with your other games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
