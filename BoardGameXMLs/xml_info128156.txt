							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shotgun Jousting</name>
									
			<description>Two gangs of bikers meet in the desert and after drinking themselves silly decide that jousting on their motorbikes, using shotguns rather than lances, is a good idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A two player push your luck game. Each player has 11 cards, and each selects and plays one card from their hand simultaneously until one or both players plays the &amp;quot;BLAM&amp;quot; card, which ends the round.  The player playing the &amp;quot;BLAM&amp;quot; card scores for the cards they have already played this round. The game is played over four rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
