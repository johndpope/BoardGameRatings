			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War Stories: Fog of War is a transmedia setting enhancement for Contagion Second Edition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Contagion is a dark and terrifying place. On the surface, it looks much like the world you and I live in. Just beneath that surface, in the shadows, rages an ancient conflict between supernatural factions who all seek dominion over the Earth and control over the souls of humanity. Supernatural creatures stalk the night, hiding among, and sometimes hunting, humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some humans, not content to be regarded as simple prey for supernatural beings, stand against the various factions in this war. Through magic, technology, or sheer grit, these people act as defenders of the innocent and shepherds of the weak. Heroes of this sort often find themselves standing alone against a seemingly endless tide of gods, monsters and demons, all seeking to lord over humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War Stories: Fog of War focuses on the story of one such hero, a human named Arianna Nighthawk. When acting to protect an innocent young girl from a demon, Arianna is inadvertently dragged into the fight between Heaven and Hell. After narrowly escaping a deadly battle with the demon Kerberos, Arianna is visited by an angel of the Lord, who hopes to enlist her aid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War Stories: Fog of War includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A 16 page setting enhancement detailing two new spells and three adventure seeds.&lt;br/&gt;    Biographical information and pregenerated character sheets for the three new characters featured in War Stories: Fog of War.&lt;br/&gt;    A short film/video asset to be used as an in-game prop/story aid by the Gamemaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
