			<description>&amp;quot;The test is about to begin. Gather the correct combination of food items as they move on the conveyor belt and deliver it to the organic test subjects. Execute the right subroutines to serve them what would keep their squishy meat components operating within their optimal parameters. The robot model that performs the best will be selected for mass production. Ensure that it is you.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robo Diner is a fast-paced family card game featuring set collection and simultaneous action selection mechanics for 2-4 players ages 12 and up. Players start the game with a robot waiter character card that is placed in front of a specific section of the conveyor belt. When a round begins, players will secretly choose whether or not they will move the belt by one step.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Food items on the belt can be manipulated with the use of power cards. Players pick up the card that is located in front of their character in order to fulfill customer orders. At the end of the game, the winner is the player that has managed to please customers the most by grabbing the right cards from the belt, completing orders, and avoiding mistakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
