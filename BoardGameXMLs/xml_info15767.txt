							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lowe&#039;s Horse Racing Game</name>
									
			<description>4 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 7/8 Maroon 'leatherette' box made to look like a small book. Spine has silver 'Horse Race', 'VOL. 534', and 'E.S.Lowe'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents include a 'cribbage-like' board with 6 numbered lanes, each lane is 14 straight spaces long, 6 numbered paper cards with individual historic horse names, 6 small colored pegs that look like tiny chess queens in a small slide-out tray, and 3 wooden six-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No rules were included but the 'obvious' play is to select a numbered horse in the field of 6. Roll the 3 dice and then move each numbered horse up the track the number of spaces that its number comes up on the dice. Holes are drilled to allow placement of Win, Place, and Show pegs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
