			<description>Lapses Calumni #09 &amp;ndash; The Green Talon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Editorial blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Another issue of Lapsus Calumni done, this one again created completely on my iPad. I have to say I am really enjoying the ability to create, edit, and layout these issues of the zine o my iPad. It is extremely easy to complete these and I think produce a decent product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this issue, we delve back into the world of Sylnae, this time visiting a pub my players had visited in my previous campaign. I have ï¬‚eshed out Sarge and Maryiam a little from how they were written many years ago. The Green Talon sits in the middle of the small village of Aywick, one of the two places visited by my players numerous times and served a sort of base of operations for them (along with Croftminster). Sadly Snikle never really visited the place, but I am enjoying his experiences and showing his unique point of view on places around the world. I have a few more places in Aywick that I hope to explore and detail in upcoming issues of the zine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;This issue features short fiction and a system-agnostic fantasy tavern based on the fiction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
