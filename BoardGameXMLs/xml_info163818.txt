			<description>Take part in a rebellion in this all vs. one game! Overthrow Enderlin or defend it - your choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Empires rise and empires fall. Whether through mistreatment of the locale, mismanagement of responsibility, or outside invaders all empires eventually meet their reckoning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reckoning day of the city of Enderlin has arrived. Civil unrest has led to rebellion. Rebel leaders take up the sword in the name of freedom. They raise their battlecry in the hopes that the people will join them in taking up arms against the King and Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the story of Enderlin. This is the story of its Uprising...'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Uprising, players take on the role of either the King of Enderlin or one of the Rebels working towards toppling the Empire. In this all vs. one scenario, players must defeat the opposing forces through the use of influence and diplomacy - swaying the ten unique Districts of Enderlin to their cause by the actions that they take. The Districts of Enderlin are the key to victory. Only through his influence on the people can the King squelch the rebellion that has arisen. Only through their influence on the masses can the Rebels hope to topple the tyrant. Who the player influences determines their bonuses and abilities as well as the ultimate fate of Enderlin. Use your Influence wisely to sway the Districts of Enderlin for your forces!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
