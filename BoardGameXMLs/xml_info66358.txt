							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BrainBox: Manchester United Game</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Manufacturer's Description&lt;br/&gt;BrainBox Manchester United is a game for the whole family. The game is ingeniously simple. A player has ten seconds to study a card that shows players past and present in action and is then asked a question about the card, chosen by the roll of a die. If the card is answered correctly the card is kept, if not it is returned to the box. The most cards held after ten minutes decides the winner. Cards are real photos of players, with extra information like how many caps the player has, the year of their International debut and what shirt number they wear. Hard core fans can put their knowledge to the test--especially if their powers of observation let them down. The game is presented in a smart cube box and is a perfect gift for Man U fans who already have everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
