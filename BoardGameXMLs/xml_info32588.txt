							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Legend of Jesse James Game</name>
									
			<description>Based on the eponymous television show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the Game: Jesse James and his Gang of Outlaws have robbed a train, placing the &amp;ldquo;loot&amp;rdquo; into Saddlebags.  While being chased by a posse, the gang hid the Saddlebags in the rocks at seven different places along the road.  They escaped the posse by the separating, each going to his own &amp;ldquo;hideout&amp;rdquo;.  Later they came out to recover the &amp;ldquo;loot&amp;rdquo;.  In this game, the players are members of the Jesse gang who come from their Hideouts, to ravel around the road, pick up the Saddlebags and carry them back to their Hideouts.  They compete with each other in gathering the most Loot.  They even try to steal a Saddlebag from their opponents by means of a gunfight.  The bags may change hand several times as the outlaws continually circle the board trying to get their Loot safely into their Hideouts.  The one getting the most Loot into his Hideout wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
