							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Less Than Useful Books to Find on a Futuristic Bookshelf</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a supplement intended to flesh out the, possibly virtual, bookshelves of a virtual setting. Some of the books, in whatever form, that players may discover may be useful or valuable, but these will not be the only ones  found, so what about the others?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a list of 100 different, not exactly useful, low worth books that can be used to answer players' questions about what books they find. Each has the title, author and an overview of the, generally useless, contents. Both fiction and non-fiction books are listed. In a futuristic setting, these books may be electronic in some way, and may be discovered on people's electronic devices. As such, they are unlikely to be worth anything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do-It-Yourself Cybernetic Implants by Jendith Yorga - Non-fiction, how to make and implant your own cyberware, really not a good idea using this as it can lead to all sorts of problems, with infections and different side effects being common&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page of the supplement is the cover, one page the front matter and introduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
