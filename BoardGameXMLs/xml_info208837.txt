							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Duelo: Kung-fu</name>
									
			<description>The Kung Fu master of his temple is aging. His movements are not as fast as before and he's increasingly tired. He realizes that he will not be around much longer, and is in a hurry to choose his successor. You are one of the most prepared candidates to be the next master, but this task will not be easy because there can only be one master. There will be several duels ahead ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Duelo: Kung Fu, players are masters of various martial arts styles invited to the big tournament that will determine who will be the new Master of Kung-Fu. To win the tournament, you should eliminate your opponents by knockout competition or winning more duels than them when the time is up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you can choose to fight with one of your opponents or reflect to better prepare for a future duel.&lt;br/&gt;If you opt for reflection, play the card face up and use the first effect. If you choose the combat, play a card face down and choose an opponent. That player must place a card from his hand face down and then both are revealed. Activate the second effect of the card. Who ever has the greater focus(the number on top left) wins the duel. The winner draws a card as a prize and puts the defeated card in his victory pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each style has its strengths and weaknesses. Explore them to be the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
