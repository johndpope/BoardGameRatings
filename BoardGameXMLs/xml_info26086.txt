			<description>This beautifully crafted vintage cycling game in a wooden box was produced in the USA at the end of the 19th century and truly a collectors item. There are 6 pawns, each representing a player. What makes it original is that movement is not decided by dice but by a spinning device (also ranging from 1 movement space to maximum 6). Every space on the board track also has text upon it, either giving the player luck or bad luck. Winner is the one who crosses the finish line first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
