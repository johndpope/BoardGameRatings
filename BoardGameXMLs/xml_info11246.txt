			<description>A deck of cards marked one to eleven are shuffled and five are dealt to each player.  On their turn, players lay down any pairs in their hand in front of them.  Current players may ask the player to their left for a specific card, but does not have to be a card that they have to form a pair.  If the player being asked for a card claims not to have that card, the current player rolls the die.  If the die is blank, the current players turn is over.  If a red dot is rolled, the current player may use the Snooper to examine the back of the second players cards.  If the card asked for is in the second players hand, he must give it to the current player.  The second player is also penalized a pair of cards already played for being caught bluffing.  If the player caught bluffing does not have a pair to give, the current player may draw a card from the second players hand.  The game is over when all of the cards have been laid out face up in pairs on the table and no players have cards in their hands.  The player  with the greatest number of pairs is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
