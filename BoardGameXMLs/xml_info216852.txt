			<description>This game appeared on p. 67 of the 1979 November/December issue of Games magazine (though it is not the &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; game of that issue).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a 2-player paper and pencil game played on a grid of 6 squares by 6 squares. The first turn is slightly different from the following turns: on the first turn the first player writes his initial in any square, as does the second player (though this could not be the square initialed by the first player).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the second and subsequent turns each player 1) fills in the square in which he had previously put his initial and 2) initials another square which is a queen's move from the square which he has just filled in (initialed and filled in squares are barriers to this process).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player loses when he is no longer able to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
