							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">carry. a game about war. revised edition</name>
									
			<description>From Publisher's Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About The Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;carry is a game focused on the experience of being a soldier in the Vietnam war. Heavily inspired by the films Platoon and Full Metal Jacket and the novel The Things They Carried, carry is designed to provide a serious roleplaying experience in the tradition of these sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revised Edition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The revised edition is an extensively re-organized and re-written text, keeping the core of the original game but revising some of the mechanics to keep focus on the experience of play. With more explication, examples and resources to aid play, this edition reflects 10 years of experience with the game since initial release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-  Set cast of characters, customized by a collaborative system of creating the Burdens they bring with them into war.&lt;br/&gt;- No-prep, designed to play out fully in 1-2 sessions of 3-4 hours.&lt;br/&gt;- Unified dynamic die pool mechanic that address issues of trust, dissension and loyalty.&lt;br/&gt;- Can be played in more realistic or cinematic styles based on the groups preference - it doesn't have to be heartbreaking!&lt;br/&gt;More Information&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How soldiers behave in war is a difficult topic, and the game focuses more on dealing with that difficulty than on celebrating violence or exploring tactical and strategic choices. The way that players have described a session is &amp;ldquo;fun, but in the way watching a really serious drama is fun, not fun like popcorn and beer fun.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;carry is structured in a short-form style. It generally plays out from start to finish in one three-to-four hour session. Over the course of the game, characters deal (or fail to deal) with their Burdens and the pressures and difficulties coming from the other characters, and from the GM. At the end of the game, everyone has a chance to talk about both what happens to their characters in the end, and how these characters are remembered in the aftermath of the events of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
