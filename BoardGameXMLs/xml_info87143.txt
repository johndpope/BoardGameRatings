							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lee Trevino&#039;s Fighting Golf</name>
									
			<description>Lee Trevino's Fighting Golf is an alternating one to four-player arcade game released by SNK in 1988.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player can choose between four different golfers, each one having his or her own advantages and disadvantages. Lee Trevino is playable as a character named Super Mex. Despite the title, no fighting is involved in the game. Other characters are Pretty Amy, Miracle Chosuke and Big Jumbo. Pretty Amy is not as strong, but easier to control. Miracle Chosuke and Super Mex are somewhat in the middle. Big Jumbo has the best range, but the worst control (in this game, &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; refers to the length of the aiming guide).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game play was relatively simplistic, completely devoid of the storylines and off-field strategizing common of sports games today. The player had to avoid sand traps, water hazards, rough ground and trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The courses themselves ranged from relatively straight-forward fairways to elaborate arrangements of sand traps. There were two courses, Japan and the U.S.. The U.S. course main hazards were its placement of bunkers and super rough. The Japan course main hazards were water and going out of bounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, the player was greeted with a photorealistic shot of the country club lodge against the setting sun and surrounded by trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Lee Trevino's Fighting Golf&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
