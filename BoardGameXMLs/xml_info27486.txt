			<description>The object of the game is to move all your sheep to their shepherd. A number of sheep-dogs on the board may block the sheep, making the shepherd's job much more difficult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was an entry to the Mesomorph 1 Piecepack Contest, and is designed for a standard piecepack and the playing card expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
