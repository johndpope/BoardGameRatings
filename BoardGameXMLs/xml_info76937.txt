							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade</name>
									
			<description>Command &amp;amp; Conquer: Renegade is a first and third person shooter video game developed by Westwood Studios and is part of the Command &amp;amp; Conquer series. It is the only C&amp;amp;C game that uses the first person view.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multiplayer element of this game takes the form of 'Command and Conquer Mode', in which players are divided into the two teams: GDI and Nod. Each team starts with its own base; team members can independently purchase vehicles and advanced character classes to destroy the enemy base and defend their own base. A match is won when one team destroys the other's base or when one team has more points than the other when the time limit expires. Damaging and destroying enemy units and structures earns points. Some servers allow the 'endgame beacon' option that causes a side to immediately win if that side's 'superweapon' beacon is successfully planted and detonated on a 'beacon pedestal' in the other side's base. Gameplay is a combination of FPS and RTS elements, since team members receive money from tiberium harvesting and must purchase their own individual equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Command &amp;amp; Conquer: Renegade,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
