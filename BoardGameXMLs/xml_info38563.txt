							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flicking Football</name>
									
			<description>Flicking Football&lt;br/&gt;Strike it toward the goal post!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notwithstanding the Japanese market it is targeted at, the game simulates 'kicking' a football through an American football goal. For some reason (maybe it flicks better) the football is shaped like an isosceles right angled triangle. Players take turns trying to flick the football with their fingers through the goal posts. The stand for the goal incorporates a metal spring - hitting the posts and causing the goal to sway means a miss, even if the football does pass between the posts.&lt;br/&gt;Players try to score more goals than other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the instructions on the back:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;How to play - Use the finger pinball to goal. It can succeed if the ball through the goal, otherwise it will be failed if the ball bumps the post.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
