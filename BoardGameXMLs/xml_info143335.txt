			<description>Documentation accompanying program listing in SoftSide Magazine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why settle for watching baseball on television when you can play it! With this game, you can make the team, but winning may be another matter. A game for two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You set the strategy for pitching and hitting, and you have to move your player across the screen to do the fielding, but there is nothing cut and dried in this version of baseball. The catcher may miss a tag on a squeeze play at home, the shortstop commit an error on an easy double play ball, or you could even be ahead in the ninth by several runs, have two outs with no one on base, and still blow it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
