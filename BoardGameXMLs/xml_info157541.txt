							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monsters of Wizardry &amp; Warriors</name>
									
			<description>from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;What is a fantasy world without strange monsters and mythical creatures to roam the land, dazzle the eye, and cause fear in the mighty? There are monsters here from stories, myth, legends, and the ancient past. They are specifically formatted to be used with the Wizardry &amp; Warriors supplemental rules for the Tunnels &amp; Trolls 5th edition role-playing game. They are organized in alphabetical order for easy searching. There is a Level indicated to help you match these creatures to adventurers&amp;rsquo; levels. At the end of this book are some charts to help you pick creatures to fit in a particular environment. If it is a dungeon, swamp, forest, or river...you will have all of the information you need to fill your fantasy world with the best creatures in the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
