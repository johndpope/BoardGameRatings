			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t forget the balloon&amp;hellip; Ranch Party is a fun tactical puzzle that teaches planning and encourages logical thinking. The task of the players is completing rows and columns of cards presenting farm animals heading for a big birthday party. This is how they collect valuable victory points. However, planning their own moves, they must pay close attention not to make the task easier for their opponents. And the key to success is&amp;hellip; the red balloon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     During the game, the excitement grows like in a good action film.&lt;br/&gt;     After the game is over, everyone wants to play again. And again. And again&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;     The rules are easy enough to learn in just a few minutes.&lt;br/&gt;     The funny cartoons will cheer every sourpuss up.&lt;br/&gt;     The compact box will fit even in a small purse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
