			<description>In Colour Blind, players act as apprentices to the art greats, but disaster has struck and they must reorganize the spilt paint before their masters come back. Players place cards in the center of the playing area, and when a player can recognize a valid order of paint on the table, they hit the timer. The goal of the game is then to build a set of paints in order from what is on the table before the timer runs out. If they do, they win a point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A battery-powered timer is included in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
