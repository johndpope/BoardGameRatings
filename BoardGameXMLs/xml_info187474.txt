			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Double Team: Valentine VS Spacecase Brings the Stars to Your Game (Again)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Double Team: Valentine VS Spacecase provides two characters for your Super-Powered by Mutants &amp;amp; Masterminds games: Valentine, hunter and killer of extraterrestrials, and Spacecase, a kid wearing a suit from space that is afraid of flying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Valentine is a former government assassin who lost his loved one to combative aliens. Since then, he has made it his life's mission to hunt down all extraterrestrials (and many other things that are not human) to kill them. Without discretion or mercy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spacecase was a kid with his eyes always set on space, and then the day came when something alien fell into his hands. It was a suit worn by intergalactic lawmen, with the ability to fly, shoot energy blasts, and more! Too bad this suit was broken, though. Now wearing an alien suit with an AI that is both cowardly and afraid of heights, will Spacecase's dream of being a super-hero come true?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
