			<description>Each player has a set of 4 pawns that start in his or her corner of the board. The goal is to move the pawns around the board to the &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; section. Movement is determined by a die. The Players have to pay an entry of game coins into the bank. The winner is the first player to move all pawns &amp;quot;home&amp;quot;. pawns can be brought into play by rolling the number indicated at the &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; sections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In game 1 up to 3 players share one game track (red or black). If a player gets on a &amp;quot;W&amp;quot;-space, the pawn either is returned to the players corner and has to start anew, or the player has to pay a prior fixed amount of game coins into the bank. If a pawn would get on a space, that is alredy occupied by another pawn, it jumps over and gets one space ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In game 2 all players move around the same game track and may capture each others pawns. Captured pawns are returned to their player's corner and must start their journey over. If a pawn gets on a &amp;quot;W&amp;quot;-space, the player has to pay a prior fixed amount of game coins into the bank. If the &amp;quot;W&amp;quot;-space is already oppupied, the first pawn gets captured and it's player has to pay the same amount of game coins to the owner of the second pawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The clover on the cover may indicate that this game was published by Klee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
