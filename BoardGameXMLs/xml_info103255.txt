			<description>Konductra is a puzzle game for the Nintendo DS published by O~3 Entertainment. The game had an interesting development cycle, with IGN revealing the title on November 23, 2005. At the time independent developer oeFun had started work without having a publisher lined up. oeFun and O~3 came into a publishing agreement in the summer of 2006 after the title was finished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players destroy lines by matching tiles and using the stylus to trace from like coloured conductors running along the four edges of the screen. The bottom touch screen is where the game is played. The top screen shows integral information about the game being played. The built-in tutorial, with speech, offers an overview of game basics. There is a timer that counts down as the piece is being positioned, and if the tile is not placed on the grid by the time the countdown reaches zero, the piece is automatically put on the board as a &amp;quot;block&amp;quot; tile. These &amp;quot;blocks&amp;quot; can only be removed by being conducted in a chain twice, as opposed to just once for a normal token. Modes include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Konductra,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
