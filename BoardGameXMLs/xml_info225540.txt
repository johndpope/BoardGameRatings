			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an unusual turn of events, the Gorgon has chosen to enlist mortal agents in her feud with the Dark Queen. The full reasons for her request remain a mystery, but the information she shares is earnest and her offer to cooperate is sincere. Melusine wishes to see Hecate removed from  Morden. She is willing to make concessions to the region&amp;rsquo;s mortal inhabitants&amp;mdash;including Accursed belonging to the Order of the Penitent&amp;mdash;if they assist her. This alliance of convenience could lead to a tremendous opportunity for the Order, but it is not without risk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strained Allegiance is a short scenario that focuses on the adventures of a band of Witchmarked heroes in the Accursed game setting. It is intended for experienced characters, of Veteran level or higher. The adventure may be played as a standalone, or it may be used with the Plot Point Campaign included in Accursed. The adventure features brief scene descriptionss, with necessary game mechanics and opportunity for tasks that can be resolved in a variety of ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
