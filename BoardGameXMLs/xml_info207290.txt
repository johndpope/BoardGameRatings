							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mission Impractical</name>
									
			<description>You are on a secret mission and may not talk about it. The only hint about your goal is the equipment you're bringing. Can you use it to give your friends the information they need? Who will be the first to see through your cunning plan, and who can tell the best story about it? If you pick, say, the trampoline, motorcycle helmet, water wings and a clothesline, what is your mission? Are you planning to...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Impress the in-laws?&lt;br/&gt;     Jump from a plane?&lt;br/&gt;     Get past a bouncer?&lt;br/&gt;     Put the kids to bed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How creative are you, and how creative do the other players think you are? Mission Impractical is the party game about not knowing your limitations and forgetting all about the laws of physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, four mission cards are placed on the table. The active player draws a number to see which mission they have to fulfill, then selects four out of sixteen available item cards to give clues as to what that mission is. Each other player tells a story that explains what they think the plan might be, then the active player reveals the real plan. For each player that guesses correctly, both the guesser and the active player receive a point. A player who guesses correctly before the fourth item is chosen receives a bonus &amp;mdash; but only one such point is available per round, so be quick!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
