			<description>Frogger's Adventures: The Rescue is an action-adventure video game released in 2003 by Konami HWI. It is based on the original 1981 Frogger arcade game, and contains similar hop-and-dodge style gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A young Frog named Frogger is relaxing inside his home in Firefly Swamp when a spaceship crashes in his yard, injuring his friend and guardian Lumpy. The driver of the ship turns out to be Beauty Frog of F.I.R.S.T. (Frog International Rescue Support Team). Frogger becomes a member of F.I.R.S.T. and goes on missions to exotic locations to rescue many of Beauty Frog's friends, including Doctor Frog, who is needed to heal Lumpy. Finally he rescues his girlfriend Lily, who has been kidnapped by T.R.I.P (Tyrannical Reptiles in Power).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains hop-and-dodge style gameplay similar to that of the original arcade game. Frogger, however, can perform many moves that he could not in the original. Frogger can perform a &amp;quot;super hop&amp;quot; which allows him to jump over the space in front of him, as well as being able to move footholds and sections of certain walls with his tongue. (This is the first Frogger game to include tongue moves.) Frogger can also rotate left and right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Frogger's Adventures: The Rescue&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
