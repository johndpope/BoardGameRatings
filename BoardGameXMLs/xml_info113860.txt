			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As this adventure begins, an experimental U.S. aircraft has gone down over Antarctica. Was the plane shot down by Skorpion, or did the weather cause the crash? Only once you brave the Winter Kill can you find out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this Mission Pack, PCs take the role of Strike Force 7 operatives sent to the Antarctic to complete a two-fold operation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Find and rescue any surviving pilots.&lt;br/&gt;    Discover the cause of the crash and deal with Skorpion and or any foreign powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mission must be completed within 24 hours or the weather will kill any survivors and greatly increase the likelyhood of enemy nations discovering the downed aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Mission Pack is a challenging adventure for use with Savage Worlds. Players must use all of their skills and wits to survive one of the most inhospitable climates in the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A detailed adventure complete with time frames and plot movers.&lt;br/&gt;    Six pregenerated Strike Force 7 characters so you can get into the action at the drop of a hat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operation Winter Kill is a complete adventure for Savage Worlds.
