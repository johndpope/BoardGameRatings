							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Glyph: Destruction Dice</name>
									
			<description>Tucked away in the corner of the tribe&amp;rsquo;s archives, a dusty tome has been discovered. In it, scholars have come across what had only been legend: a new method of harnessing the power of the glyphs. Why had this tome been hidden away? Unfortunately, the scholars learned the answer to their question much too late, and cursed they ever found the tome&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Glyph of Destruction is a new glyph in the land of Tundrus. This glyph, as the name suggests, is not to be trifled with. The new method of harnessing the glyphs has remarkable power: Players are able to generate doubles of any glyph they desire with ease. But such power comes at a cost. In rare instances, the method doesn&amp;rsquo;t generate the desired glyph, but instead forms an entirely new glyph. A glyph that eradicates the power the player once had.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a champion&amp;rsquo;s REPLENISH phase, players may elect to temporarily substitute active dice for one or more of five black dice. Each of these dice specialize in one of the five other glyphs. Four of the sides have a double-glyph of the die&amp;rsquo;s specialization. Be warned, however, for the other two sides have the Destruction Glyph. Any time the Destruction Glyph is rolled, the die is immediately locked in (can&amp;rsquo;t be rerolled), and the original die that was substituted for the black die is trashed. Once the black die has performed its function that activation, it is returned to the general stock and players regain the die that was substituted (assuming it wasn&amp;rsquo;t destroyed).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
