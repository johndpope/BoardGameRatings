							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Turok: Evolution</name>
									
			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turok: Evolution is a first-person shooter video game developed and published by Acclaim Entertainment. The game was originally released for the Game Boy Advance but then later released for the Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox  in 2002. A port for the PC was released in 2003 for the European market. It is followed by a 2008 entry in the Turok video games series, called Turok.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game follows Tal'Set, a Navajo Indian  who is transported to the Lost Lands while fighting Captain Tobias Bruckner (a tyrannical and genocidal maniac who sees Native Americans as worthless animals; apparently based upon George Custer; though bloosthirsty to the point of psychosis) of the United States Army; apparently this occurs in the late 19th century, around the time of the Indian Wars. He is rescued by the seer Tharkeen that says he is the legendary Son of Stone, known to them as Turok. After being rescued, Tal'Set is sent to eradicate the jungles around the River Village of the Slegs, a race of sentient, humanoid reptiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
