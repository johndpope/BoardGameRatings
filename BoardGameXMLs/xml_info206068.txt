			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xenofera is a strategic card game where players compete to build the most valuable collection of xenofera, alien creatures, from across the galaxy. The game supports 2 -5 players with a play time of 30-75 mins or roughly 15 mins per player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background:&lt;br/&gt;Once a decade, the Royal Society of Xenofera Huntsmen sponsors a Galactic hunt. It's members compete to assemble the most magnificent collections of xenofera, alien creatures, from around the galaxy. Points are awarded based on the appeal of the creatures in their collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have been hired by one of the members to lead their expedition. They have supplied you with a ship, but you will need to recruit your own crew, build cages, and finally capture creatures. The more appealing the better, though they have requested you obtain a certain collection that the member thinks will give them an advantage in the hunt. To win, you will need to compete with other huntsmen for crew members and creatures. And no leader is above sabotaging other expeditions to win. So you will need to be vigilant and cunning if you are to capture the best collection and become the greatest hunter in the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective:&lt;br/&gt;To win you will need to create the highest scoring collection of creatures.  Scores are based on&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reward system:&lt;br/&gt;Points are earned per creature, with each creature having a unique value. Points are also earned by completing specific collections of creatures. Each player will have their own, hidden, collection(s) that they are attempting to complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are lost when collections are not completed. Points can also be lost when a player has certain crew members in their crew at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
