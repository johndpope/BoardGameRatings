			<description>This is the second print-and-play game by Big Little Games. The players take control of an alien race and battle the other players for control of an unexplored region of space. The board get build up from planet/empty tiles randomly drawn as the players explore it. Players own 3 alien technology cards each that give them special powers and that are replaced by new ones once used. The players own a limited amount of population units that are permanently removed as result of combats. Players attack each other by simply moving more population units onto a planet. The rules are very simple and fit on two small pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
