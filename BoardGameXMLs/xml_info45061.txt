			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Blueprints product line offers you old-fashioned blue printed maps for using in your adventures and campaigns. For each map you get a blueprint version and a standard black and white version. The maps are all vector-based so you will get maximum print resolution. Despite their old fashioned appearance each map offers you a degree of customization, using the pdf technology at its best. A button (which will not be printed) on each map allows you to turn on and off the grid, eliminate the room numbers, get the walls filled, don't show doors and furniture and many other options, depending on the kind of map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each product features a classic fantasy adventure location: a dungeon, a keep, a temple complex, a thieves guild and so on. You can use these map as reference to build your own adventures or simply take them at hand in case your players go in an unexpected direction during the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cutthroats' Alley is one of the most infamous places in the Great City. No place has such concentrate of evil and depravity. One who dare to enter in the alley, does it at his own risk. An occasional visitor who enters the alley during the day, can see only a normal city alley, with a small church, a bakery, a locksmith and a tavern. True, some bad-looking guys wander in the alley or stay in clutches playing card games over crates or barrels, but this is all one can see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The truth is far more dangerous as the baker is a known fence, the tavern is owned by a guy who tortures people, the locksmith is a prohibited weapon dealer and owner of an house of pleasure, the church's crypt is the meeting place of evil summoners and, finally, in the sewers below there is the lair of one of the most wanted smugglers of the city.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A short list of featured building follow (more bits of information available inside the products)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The One-Eyed Kobold Inn&lt;br/&gt;     Rippus Bakery&lt;br/&gt;     The Church of the Empty Hand&lt;br/&gt;     Gruddart The Locksmith&lt;br/&gt;     The Gambler's Den&lt;br/&gt;     The Smuggler's Cove&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
