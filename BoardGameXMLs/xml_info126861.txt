			<description>Edgewise is a speed matching tile game where you race to play your 12 player chips first by matching the edges to the starter chip of each round or any player chips already played. There are twelve rounds that change with each starter chip.  A point is scored for each chip played along with bonus points.  The most points at the end of all the rounds wins the game.  The game can be customized to however many rounds you want to play.  If your time is limited, you can play 2-3 different rounds in under 20 minutes.  You can also have multiple games going at the same time since Edgewise has 12 starter chips that determine each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:  84 hexagon-shaped game pieces&lt;br/&gt;Game Pieces:  72 Player Tiles (12-Black, 12-Turquoise, 12-Pink, 12-Green, 12-Orange, 12-Purple), 12 Starter Tiles (1-&amp;quot;Basic&amp;quot; round, 1-&amp;quot;Follow the Leader&amp;quot; round, 1-&amp;quot;Teams&amp;quot; round, 1-&amp;quot;Longest Chain&amp;quot; round, 1-&amp;quot;No Reds&amp;quot; round, 1-&amp;quot;Opposites Attract&amp;quot; round, 1-&amp;quot;Stack 'Em&amp;quot; round, 1-&amp;quot;Capture&amp;quot; round, 1-&amp;quot;Dead End&amp;quot; round, 1-&amp;quot;Freeze Tag&amp;quot; round, 1-&amp;quot;Rotate&amp;quot; round, 1-&amp;quot;Share the Love&amp;quot; round)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
