			<description>Get to the Islands; visit the villages to discover the clues leading to the treasure; be the first to get the treasure and leave the islands with it...before somebody else steals it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D&amp;eacute;barquer aux &amp;Icirc;les; visiter les villages pour y d&amp;eacute;couvrir les indices menant au tr&amp;eacute;sor; &amp;ecirc;tre le premier &amp;agrave; s'en emparer et &amp;agrave; quitter les &amp;Icirc;les en sa possession...en &amp;eacute;vitant de se le faire voler &amp;agrave; son tour!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play the game?&lt;br/&gt; A clue card (&amp;quot;Indices&amp;quot;) is randomly selected and placed in the treasure chest. That now becomes the common goal to reach - where the treasure is hidden!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First Phase:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives a &amp;quot;Villages&amp;quot; card and secretly looks at it. Each player rolls a die; the player with the highest number starts. Players take turns trying to get to their destination (&amp;quot;Villages&amp;quot; card) as fast as possible by rolling two dice and only choosing one. When a player reaches her destination, she can now look at a clue card &amp;quot;Indices&amp;quot;. The player draws a new &amp;quot;Villages&amp;quot; card and continues moving. The phase ends when all &amp;quot;Villages&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Indices&amp;quot; cards have been drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second Phase:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this second phase, there is no specific destination. Each time a player stops her movement on another player's village, she looks at the &amp;quot;Indices&amp;quot; card found there. Players collect clues until they think they have enough data (there are 10 clues total in the game - with 9 clues collected, a player should know exactly where the treasure is hidden). Then, they try to move to where the treasure is located. If a player has found the right spot, she takes the treasure and the third phase begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Third phase:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who has found the treasure first must leave the Islands, carrying it, by boat or by plane. Other players will try to steal the treasure by landing on the same spot. The game ends when the treasure is out of the Islands...and the player who leaves with it wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
