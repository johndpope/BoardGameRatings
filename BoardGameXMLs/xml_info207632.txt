			<description>&amp;ldquo;Once upon a time, there was a very sad princess. She felt so unloved and unhappy, that everything around her became grey and lifeless and the entire land was deprived of its color and joy. Our fable begins when a single, lonely lantern was lit in a faraway village&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the wind and guide a beautiful sky lantern that spreads the powerful message of everlasting love, by bringing life and color back to the world around you. Enjoy four beautiful Asian-inspired worlds, each with a different theme, nature and architecture. Spread vibrant, happy colors through grey and lifeless lands by flying over them as a red, light-emitting lantern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
