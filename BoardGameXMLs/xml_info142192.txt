			<description>A simple game in a small box which suites perfectly for trips or chat-ins with the guests. One of the players becomes a mad professor, others &amp;ndash; his bachelors. All together they try to create a monster Frankenstein of different body parts (arms, legs, heads, horns, tails, etc.) The person who has made the monster first wins the round.&lt;br/&gt;The game process consists of two main parts: making professors tasks and independent investigations. In the first part you have to four-flush a little and to make measured decisions about components pass, in the second part you have to consider the variants of the situation development for all parties. Finally you&amp;rsquo;ll have asoft and easy game with a short set where either everything may be computed beforehand, or you may just enjoy the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
