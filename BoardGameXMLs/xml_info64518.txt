			<description>Develops concentration and problem-solving skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This colorful game encourages young children to recognize and match objects, skills they will need when they learn to read and write. Players identify the familiar pictures of everyday objects shown on the lotto cards and match them to similar pictures on the game boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many different ways to play, and each version is progressively more difficult. The materials in this game can be used for story telling, as well as for sorting and organizing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
