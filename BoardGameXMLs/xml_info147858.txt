			<description>Battle is a small, simplified version of Battle: The Game of Generals. The players each have six infantry and four armor units, which they secretly set up at opposite ends of a 9x12 hex grid. On a turn a player may move any or all of their pieces and can eliminate an opponent's piece by getting a greater combat value of pieces adjacent to it. Combat values are different in the three different terrain types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to move a piece into the opponent's headquarters space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in the 'May/June 1981 issue of GAMES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
