			<description>An unsavoury crime has been committed in Mintsby and you, the amateur sleuth Sherbet Holmes, aided by your dear friend Dr Winegum, are charged with solving the case.&lt;br/&gt;You must move around the randomly generated playing area, search locations and memorise the suspects you encounter.&lt;br/&gt;For, when you have eliminated the innocent, whoever remains, however improbable, must be the culprit.&lt;br/&gt;A glance at your pocket watch shows you only have 12 hours remaining. Come, Winegum, the game is afoot...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a take on a 'find the pairs' memory game. Find the pair of tiles of a suspect to eliminate them from your enquiries.&lt;br/&gt;However, there are also other tiles which can help or hinder your investigation.&lt;br/&gt;And you must solve the case against the clock.&lt;br/&gt;Dice are used to move to and from locations so your choice of where to search may be restricted - fortunately Dr Winegum is there to help you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elemintary was an entry in the 2016 Mint Tin Design contest and it did rather well:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2nd place (equal): Best Overall Design&lt;br/&gt;1st place: Best Artwork &amp;amp; Graphic Design&lt;br/&gt;2nd place: Best Written Rules&lt;br/&gt;4th place: Best Theme&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
