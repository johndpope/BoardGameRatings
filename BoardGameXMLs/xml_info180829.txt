							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood and Fury: New Bloodrager Bloodlines</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feel the Rage Flow Through You!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bloodragers, the hybrid class of barbarian and sorcerer from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Advanced Class Guide, offers something with a flavor that is so much more than simply its parent classes combined. The bloodrager evokes sensations of powerful savage warriors who draw upon primitive, shamanic magic in order to enhance their abilities on the field of battle. Its class features lead one to imagine that the bloodrager&amp;rsquo;s anger and fury is the source of his magical power. In a word, bloodragers are more than just sorcerers and barbarians stuck together, and so they deserve bloodlines that reflect their nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents 13 bloodlines for bloodragers, with a focus on bloodlines of a primal nature, such as those relating to totem animals, hostile terrains, and base elements. Dedicated fire, ice, lightning, stone, and wind bloodlines have unique powers relating to their element, such as fire that creates choking smoke, ice that freezes victims solid, and wind that creates whirlwinds and hurricanes, which sets these bloodlines apart from each other, and from the generic elemental bloodline that is all about dealing damage of a certain type. Totem animal bloodlines allow you to gain the power of a bear, the cunning of a wolf, the speed of a hawk, and more. Bloodlines such as desert, tundra, and jungle allow you to pull strength from the land around you, and bend the terrain to suit your nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
