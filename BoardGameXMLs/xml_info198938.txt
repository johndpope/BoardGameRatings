			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glitter Nomic is presented as a series of four YouTube videos that feature Great Leader as he presents the phases and rules of the game.  Characters in the game are created during play and have no particular rules or limitations.  They are all assumed to be an &amp;quot;elected representative&amp;quot; of a political &amp;quot;district&amp;quot; in Tiny Country.  In phase one, characters state their name, their district, and &amp;quot;what they've promised&amp;quot; their constituents.  In phase two, the characters elect a Chair from among themselves.  In phase three, the characters make, second, amend, and reject or pass Motions.  The bulk of the game rules consider the &amp;quot;rules of order&amp;quot; for this process.  Also during phase three, the characters must allocate ten billion sickles (the national budget).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
