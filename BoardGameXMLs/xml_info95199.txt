			<description>I MAED A GAM3 W1TH Z0MBIES 1N IT!!!1 is a twin-stick shooter, similar to Geometry Wars, where the players must survive waves of zombies, smiley-faced centipedes, angry faces, diamonds, and other enemies for around 13 minutes, which is the length of the theme song playing the entire game. As the theme song changes, so does the background and the enemies that appear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players can pick up a variety of weapons and power ups, such as rocket launchers, flame throwers, shields, and speed ups. Players can also pick up extra lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While &amp;quot;winning&amp;quot; can be considered surviving the waves of zombies, each enemy is worth a certain amount of points, thus each player is trying to get the best score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is available on the Xbox Live Arcade Indie Games section. It sells for 80 Microsoft points ($1 US).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
