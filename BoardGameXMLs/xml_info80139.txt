			<description>Mega Man Battle Network 2, known as Battle Network Rockman EXE 2​ (バトルネットワーク ロックマンエグゼ2) in Japan, is a video game developed by Capcom for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld game console. It is the second game of the Mega Man Battle Network series . It was released in 2001 in Japan and 2002 in America and Europe. The story of the game starts after the events of Mega Man Network Transmission. This is the only game in the Battle Network series to have profanity in it, with words such as &amp;quot;damn,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;hell,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;crap.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general gameplay is essentially identical to that of the original Mega Man Battle Network game; indeed, the two games utilize a significant amount of the same graphics. However, Battle Network 2 introduces several new concepts that augment the original game-system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of health, Mega Man no longer heals fully and automatically after each battle. Furthermore, the game introduces the SubChip, a device similar in basic concept to a battle chip but one that can only be activated outside of battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where in the original, a player had only one chip folder, Battle Network 2 introduces the possibility of alternate active folders, allowing players to easily customize their range of possible attacks to conform to multiple situations. Notably, chips used in one active folder are not available for the construction of a second, even though only one folder may be used at any given time. Up to three folders can be found in this game, and all are fully customizable. As in the previous game, folders may have up to five Navi chips each and only five of the same kind of any chip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aside from the addition of new Battle Chips in general, Battle Network 2 expanded the old chip code system, which had previously been limited only to the alphabet. Some Chips could occur with an asterisk (*) as their code letter, a wild card symbol meaning the Chip can be used with any other Chip. This game is the only Battle Network game (besides 6) where it is possible (from one chip trader only) to get * coded Navi chips. There are now 250 chips possible in single player mode, with chips 251-260 possible only via NetBattling, and chip #261 (Sanctuary) earned when the player completes Hard Mode. Players can also now earn up to five stars on the title screen by completing major tasks in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, players may access NetSquares in the game. These places serve as a sort of Town Square for NetNavis and their operators to relax, buy supplies, and exchange information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One final change was the replacement of the old armor system, which only affected damage received, with a style system that affects damage received, attack damage, physical appearance, among other benefits. During the course of the game MegaMan may take on one of five Styles (Guts, Team, Custom, Shield, and Hub), each of which will also be aligned with one of four elements (Heat, Wood, Elec, and Aqua). He can store up to two styles in his memory at once and change out when not battling. Also see Style Change for a more detailed description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting with Battle Network 2, anytime a chip trader is used, the game will automatically save when the player receives their new chip. This is to prevent the player from cheating by simply soft resetting without saving until the chip trader gives out a desirable chip, which was possible in the first game. Another chip trader tradition that starts with this game and continues on for the remainder of the series is that there is one ten chip trader that will appear only upon completing Story Mode (yellow star), and gives out the best chips of all the chip traders. This is also the only game that strays from the traditional chip trader colors (blue 3-chip trader, red 10-chip trader); it uses red for the 3-chip trader and yellow for the 10-chip trader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mega Man Battle Network 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
