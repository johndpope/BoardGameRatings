							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dotto</name>
									
			<description>Based on the 1958-1960 ITV quiz show of the same name, which in turn was based on the short-lived 1958 CBS/NBC &amp;quot;Scandal-Rigged&amp;quot; American game show of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players only get to join dots by answering questions on specific subjects. The harder the question attempted, the more dots the player is entitled to join together on that turn. After joining 25 dots the host sets the first clue to help identify the picture. A second clue was given at 35 dots, and a final clue at 40 dots. These clues should be written by the host and disclosed only to the relevant player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player calls &amp;quot;Dotto&amp;quot; if the picture is recognized at any stage of the game. The answer is given and written to the host, undisclosed to their opponent. More points are awarded for earlier recognition as each unconnected dot earned 5 points. A player must give the name of the picture to the host once all the dots are joined. The host announces whether the guess is correct or not. If correct, the second player has one attempt to guess and so draw the game. If drawn the game is repeated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alternative games can be played such as double Dotto where the value of the dots is doubled. If a player gives an incorrect answer the game is over. The opponent received no points but is victorious and remains to fight a new challenger. Any number of rounds may be played, at the end of which the player with the highest points scored is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
