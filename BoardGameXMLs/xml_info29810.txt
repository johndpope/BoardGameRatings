			<description>Chronology - Sports Edition: A Card Game for All Time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players build a time line of cards. Each card contains a sports event and the year in which it occurred. Players begin with one card each, which is placed face up in front of them. On her turn, a player is read an event from a new card; the player must then indicate the position on her own time line where the card should be placed. If she's correct she places the card in her own time line; if not, the next player gets an opportunity to win the card. The first player with ten cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards from this edition may be mixed with the original Chronology game to create even more combinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
