							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Air Hockey</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;With the option for 1 or 2 pucks, this 1 and 2-player air hockey favorite is a blast for young &amp;amp; old alike! This is the only air hockey that lets you play with 2 pucks at once!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're alone, play a computer opponent ranging from easy to INSANE! Get a friend and grab your mallets to see who dominates the table in 2-player mode. Try off the wall banks &amp;amp; combos to spoil your opponent's defenses and be the first to score 7 points - just like in real air hockey!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll play with easy to control mallets that aren't too big or small and a puck that rockets across the table. The goals are sized to perfectly balance rapid game play and the challenge of the game. Advanced physics and air hockey sounds make the game act and sound like you're playing on a real table!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Air Hockey has wireless multiplayer for across-the-room fun. It also includes 12 OpenFeint leaderboards and 1000 OpenFeint Achievement Points. &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
