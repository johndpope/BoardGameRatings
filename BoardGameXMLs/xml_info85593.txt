							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dr. Gardner&#039;s PICK-AND-TELL GAMES</name>
									
			<description>A roll-and-move game with each space indicating one of four grab-bags containing storytelling prompts (small plastic toys, face pictures, words, and descriptive actions), additional movement, or spinner use (resulting in further movement or chip award / loss). When a child lands on a &amp;quot;bag&amp;quot; space, a prompt is drawn, and varying numbers of chips are awarded for the originality and completeness of story the child tells the therapist (a beginning, middle, and end being encouraged).  The therapist may then be awarded chips for a responding story to which the child may respond for more chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's description found on multiple websites listing this game for sale:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Psychotherapeutic Game for Children&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this effective and comprehensive therapeutic game, Dr. Richard A. Gardner has combined four therapeutic storytelling techniques: The Bag of Words, The Bag of Toys, The Bag of Acts, and The Bag of Faces, incorporated in all of the important elements that have made Dr. Gardner`s games a staple of childhood therapy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instructions detail the effective use of this storytelling technique as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool, with many case examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For use by therapist plus one child. &lt;br/&gt;Ages 5-12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the directions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The time frame of play is not fixed; rather, the duration of play is determined by the therapist's judgement...When the play time is ended, the player with the most chips is declared the winner...The players need not reach the finish point to end the game...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Pick-and-Tell Games are indicated for the wide variety of children's psychotic problems.  They are contraindicated for psychotic children and/or those significantly involved in fantasy.  Such children's problems might be entrenched because the games encourage further fantasizing.  Such children should play reality-oriented games e.g. The Talking, Feeling, and Doing Game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Pick-and-Tell Games were designed to be used only by mental health professionals in their therapeutic work with children.  Accordingly, every reasonable attempt is made to limit the sale and distribution of the game to such professionals.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
