			<description>Drug use, personal demons, wild episodes, and more. Side Effects is a &amp;quot;take that&amp;quot; card game where players race to treat all the diseases in their psyche with medication and therapy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with four disease cards dealt face up in front of them (their &amp;quot;psyche&amp;quot;) and then four cards in a concealed hand. Players take turns picking up cards from the deck and trying to find the right drugs to treat their diseases. A drug card will treat a disease but also leave the player open to receiving new diseases (of that drug's list of side effects) from other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each disease card has a unique punishment written on it and episode cards will trigger these punishments. Play an episode card on another player to hinder them or help yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over when one player treats all of the diseases in their psyche.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
