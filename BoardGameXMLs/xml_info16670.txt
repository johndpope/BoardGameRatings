							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sir Hinkle Funny-Duster, the Comical Game</name>
									
			<description>The game is played with a deck of 20 cards divided into four FAMILIES; The Funnyduster Family, The Butler's Family, The Huntsman's Family, and the Gardener's Family.  With 5 cards to each family, there are cards for the father, wife, son, daughter and the family symbol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are shuffled and dealt evenly to all players.  Each player in turn freely asks any player for a specific card, if that player has the card asked for, the player must give that card to the person asking.  Play continues for the asking player until the person asked does not have the card asked for and the turn goes to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a set of Family cards is collected it is laid on the table and retired from play (scoring no points for the player).  The object is to be the player that lays down the last Family set&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A twist in the mechanics of the game adds fun to the gameplay.  Anytime a card is given to a player, the receiver must say &amp;quot;Thank You&amp;quot;, if the receiver fails to do so, the first person to say &amp;quot;Duster&amp;quot; receives all of the cards from the person that neglected to say &amp;quot;Thank You&amp;quot;.  The person receiving the cards must in turn say &amp;quot;Thank You&amp;quot; or is subject to the same &amp;quot;Duster&amp;quot; rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The person that did not say &amp;quot;Thank You&amp;quot; and lost all of their cards can not be spoken to.  They do not get any additional cards, but if someone speaks to this person, then the first person (any player) to say &amp;quot;Duster&amp;quot; receives the cards of the person that spoke to the person with no cards (and again, &amp;quot;Thank You&amp;quot; must follow receipt of the cards or the &amp;quot;Duster&amp;quot; rule applies again)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
