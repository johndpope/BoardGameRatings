			<description>Tennis Odyssey is a simulation of life as a touring professional tennis player. You will be required to maintain your fitness and form by managing your schedule and training to give yourself the best chance of winning matches and scoring important rankings points. Your world ranking tracks the progress of your career. Tennis Odyssey is designed to be realistic, and as with real life, it will be grind before glory. Persevere though, and you could be the next world number 1 and grand slam champion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All matches are decided with just 2 rolls of a die, allowing entire seasons to be played in under an hour. All players are rated for each surface. You will face tougher opposition as tournaments progress and as you move up from lower level tournaments through to grand slams. Players accrue form and wear points according to the result of each match, but must be careful to schedule weeks off to rest as wear increases the probability of injury. Injuries reduce your condition which ultimately triggers the end of your career. Top performers will earn induction into the Tennis Odyssey hall of fame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
