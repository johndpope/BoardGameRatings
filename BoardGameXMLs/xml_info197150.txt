			<description>CardRPG is a Solitaire RPG card game played with a standard deck of 52 playing cards, dice, and a character stats sheet. It was created by Ray of Ash and is featured on the Pagat Invented Games list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay begins by dividing the cards into a face up attack deck and a face down monster deck. A card is selected from among the royals to represent the player and strength and hit point stats are determined by rolling six sided dice. The player draws hand of attack cards for each point of strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game progresses through a series of monster battles. Monsters stats are determined by dice rolls and an attack pile of four cards is set aside for it. The player and monster alternate playing attack cards from their respective piles, the player by choice and the monster randomly until one of them is defeated. The player may attack with pairs simultaneously for double attack points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hit points are reset following the conclusion of the battle and a new monster is created. Experience points are gained in the amount of the hit points of the defeated monster and gold is gained equal to half of that amount. Experience points contribute to the leveling up of character stats and gold may be used to purchase attack cards from the attack pile. A player who dies in battle may be resurrected by voiding gold and experience points. The game may be concluded or suspended at any time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
