			<description>&amp;quot;Battle Frenzy is a 1994 video game developed by Jim Blackler... Battle Frenzy was one of the few first person shooters released on the Mega Drive/Genesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle Frenzy has a total of 12 levels, all taking place aboard the alien cruiser. Players have to fight their way through the decks of the ship in order to destroy the armed plasma node core located on each floor. Once the core is destroyed, a self-destruct sequence occurs and players have to run back to where they started the level before the time runs out.&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a life is lost, the player character restarts exactly where they died. If the player character loses a life during the level destruction sequence but still has more lives, they restart at the beginning of the self-destruct sequence. The player character can strafe.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Frenzy Battle Frenzy]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
