							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cyberpunk 3776</name>
									
			<description>Cyberpunk 3776 harkens back to the glory days of arcade shoot-em-ups. It all begins on a postapocalyptic earth and proceeds into space. Ultimately, your journey will be a metaphor about life and death, a road that every person has to walk down alone. The only choices you get while on your path to the inevitable end: keep your head up high or forfeit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features a bold atmosphere with seven unique stages. Each of them includes a unique boss that will challenge your skills. Cyberpunk 3776 boasts hours of breathtaking action, ship upgrades, floating healthpods and great voice acting from Nico Uusitalo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyberpunk 3776 was made by Peter Hann using Unity3D and Playmaker. The music was composed by Gabe Castro, Calbert Warner and Kevin MacLeod.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
