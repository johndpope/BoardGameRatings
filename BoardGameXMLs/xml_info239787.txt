							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Floaters In The Mozz Caves</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We all remember the day when the Labyrinth Lord ate some Mozz.  Big fat Labyrinth Lord floated away, never to be seen again.  Now we have a new Labyrinth Lord and were going to find out what he ate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Blimpkith have taken over the Orc's caves.  There's no denying the Elves aren't doing so well either.  The party, maybe on their first adventure, are walking around looking for the old Labyrinth Lord.  Something floats in front of them... was that him?  Let's see what's in the cave.  What are those, Leprechauns?  They don't seem right... too fat.  Blimpkith, haven't ever seen one of those...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Floaters In The Mozz Caves is a short low level Labyrinth Lord adventure.  A good time for all even the Blimpkith!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
