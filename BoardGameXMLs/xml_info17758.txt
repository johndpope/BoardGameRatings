			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blast! Card Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blast is the colorful, fast moving dice and card game where you can really find out who your friends are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has to match the throw of the die with the cards in their hand in order to get most points and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game play is simple - just throw the dice and match the cards - a 'blue four' on the special color-coded dice together with a 'three' on the normal dice adds up to a 'BLUE SEVEN'. If you have the 'blue seven' card in your hand then you've scored seven points and it's your turn next with the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But watch out! You're never sure of the winner until the count is up. With careful use of your action cards you can blast your opponents, lower their score , and make yourself the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    36 Dice Cards&lt;br/&gt;     19 Action Cards&lt;br/&gt;     Special color Coded Dice&lt;br/&gt;     Standard Dice&lt;br/&gt;     Rules Inside&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Listed as ages 8 to adult.&lt;br/&gt;My Waddingtons edition states it is under license from Family Games, Canada.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
