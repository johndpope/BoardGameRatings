			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;Board game &amp;quot;Teadlik Tarbija&amp;quot; (Smart Consumer) got started in the Consumer Protection Department competition for school children named &amp;quot;We can do it&amp;quot;. The game was designed by a Tartu Hiie school children and they presented it in 2005 for the named competition. All the art were made by a local school girl Cathlyn Olev (from Viimsi High 7th grade).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Tartu Hiie school all children there wither have a hearing or seeing disability. They say about the game they made like this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It was really hard to find the idea for the game at first. We looked at many different types of games and finally we thought to make something like Monopoly, but simpler. We thought, that a usual dice game with questions would be simple enough for us to do. We thought up the questions and made the cards. So that we wouldn't have to know all the answers, we made few cards with answers already on them, so we could move forward and backwards as well. The goal of the game is to learn about consuming and how to do it with reason!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game is played with dice rolls and answering questions. First person to reach the end, will win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
