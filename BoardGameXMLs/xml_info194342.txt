							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Modern Bistro</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 24 x 20 inch Battlemap of a Modern Bistro , it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play.1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Haunted? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so sir. Cups don&amp;rsquo;t move and empty on their own. I think you may have had too much liqueur in your coffee.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Bistro Server&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern Bistro is a single level interior map of a coffee shop and restaurant. There is a bit of the exterior sidewalk shown on the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern Bistro is intended for use in modern games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Espressogeist: A poltergeist haunts the local bistro. The locals tell tales of strange flickering lights at the bistro when it is closed, the sounds of machines turning on and the slamming of doors being opened and shut. During store hours, some patrons swear that they see their cups moved and the contents of their cups emptied. It never seems to happen to the tea drinkers who visit the bistro.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The poltergeist is the ghost of a former owner of the bistro who hates the modernization of his antique bistro and is trying to drive customers away. Unfortunately for the poltergeist, not only does the place serve the best coffee in town, the latest owner has smartly hired four of the prettiest women in town to be the baristas and as a result it&amp;rsquo;s more popular than ever. The poltergeist is also still obsessed with coffee and rages at night when there is no one there to make it (as he has no idea how to work the espresso machine) and steals sips during the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The poltergeist goes away if the modern machines are all removed and they go back to the old ways of making coffee and preparing food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters can get involved by this being a place they stop by to relax. While there one of them notices their cup moving and the coffee being sucked upward and then vanishing in midair. They might want to investigate the strange happenings further. Perhaps they try to sneak into the place in the middle of the night after observing the flickering lights and noises inside the place when it is closed. They could also be ghost hunters here to capture the poltergeist for the owners or ghost chasers trying to get the poltergeist on camera for proof.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
