							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Newcastle to London Cycle Race</name>
									
			<description>Game in the inside covers to the Boy's Own Paper Annual, 1964.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules:&lt;br/&gt;Here is a brand new idea! A thrilling cycle race game to liven up the long winter evenings. Any number of players can take part, and all you need is one die (two dice will speed up the game) and a few small coloured counters. The rules common to all dice games are too familiar to repeat - just remember that each space is one mile. Jump on your cycles. Right then, all set? You&amp;rsquo;re off to a flying start!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a game in the grand tradition of 'Game of Goose' race games.The winner is the first player to reach Big Ben in London.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
