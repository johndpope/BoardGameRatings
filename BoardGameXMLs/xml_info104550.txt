			<description>From the box: Addition &amp;amp; subtraction have never been so much fun (or fast)!  Players have to match the number of the card in play by using + or -!  Collect the most points or discard all your cards first and you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:  Each player gets 7 cards.  The remaining cards become the draw pile.  The dealer turns over the top card of the draw pile.  Each player tries to match the number on the card with either an exact match, or using two cards with + or -.  Multiple matches can be played.  Players keep matched cards in front of them to track points.  The dealer then brings all players back up to 7 cards.  Then a new target card is drawn.  When there are not enough cards left to bring everyone to 7 cards, the game is over.  &lt;br/&gt;An alternate rule set eliminates the target card and plays 11 rounds using the numbers 1 to 10 and a wild round where each player names their own target number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
