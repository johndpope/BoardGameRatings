			<description>From the Game's Epilogue:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the most part, these rules, even though poorly and hastily written, are everything you need mechanically. This is not a game about mass combat, or saving the day. This is about being a poor, underfed, cold, sick, and scared man who is waist deep in the snow, and is not sure if they will live to see another sunrise. A time where your first inclination upon seeing a dog is who gets first dibs when you eat it. Somewhere out across the frozen steppes, a monster is lurking, and you have barely more than sticks and stones to stop it. Read a book about the siege of Leningrad, or the battles of Kursk and Stalingad to understand what the players are stuck in. The movie &amp;quot;Enemy at the Gates&amp;quot; is another excellent resource.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps there is time for joviality in this atmosphere. People need an escape somehow, and sharing bread in these times can be as hard as facing the enemy. Give the players a chance for heroism, and more importantly, give them a chance to role play! How do they feel about fighting for the motherland? Do they really believe in communism, or are they simply afraid of the commissar?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its worth noting that there are no maximum ranges provided for the weapons listed. While I'm normally a stickler for accuracy in my mechanics and highly skilled characters, we are talking about under trained draftees thrown into the meat grinder. The GM is the arbiter of what can and can't be done. Dramatic license has a part though. Just because theres no table of vehicle hit locations doesn't mean that the characters can't take careful aim to disable it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 24 hour game, though I still plan on working on it, though technically my time is up. Actually, since I slept and ate, its probably more of a 6 hour game, but hopefully you can still enjoy it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
