			<description>A card game of martial arts combat. The game uses a custom deck containing fifty-six cards, with eight cards for each of seven different types: Punch, Kick, Block, Grab, Move, Zen, and Combo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players must roll fighter characters before play. Each fighter has ten hit points and rolls ten times on a series of Maneuver Tables. This results in a list of &amp;quot;moves&amp;quot; the fighter knows and some die roll results can add hit points. Each Maneuver is rated for a cost in cards that must be played to use the move and for damage caused by the move (Attack Maneuvers) or damage negated (Defense Maneuvers).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to reduce your opponent to zero hit points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
