							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">5 x 5 War</name>
									
			<description>This two player print and play game is actually inspired from a variant of Fire from the Sky. This game depicts the battle between two small armies of 9 soldiers each in a board of 25 grids(5 rows and 5 columns.) Three dice are also used. Each player takes the control of an army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the soldier tokens are placed in the board, one token per square. The soldiers are imagined to have both melee weapons(sword or mace) and ranged weapons. The players can throw up to three dice per turn to determine an action to be taken on the war field (board). The number of dice thrown are determined by the number of soldiers he has left on the field. Nine to seven soldiers means he can throw three dice. Six to four means he can throw 2 dice and three to one soldiers means he can throw just one die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Out of the dice he can choose any one as a row number and the other as column number. (means more the number of soldiers he has more choices at his disposal). If the grid on the field selected using this row and column has an enemy soldier, the enemy soldier is removed. If it has the player's own soldier, he can move one square and can capture an enemy soldier if there's one in that square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the user threw six, he can use it to destroy an entire row(chose a six and a row number ), or an entire column (chose a six and column number) or a combination of both (when he chose a double six for row and column), killing enemy soldiers and maybe his own soldiers as collateral damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
