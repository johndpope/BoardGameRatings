							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dungeon Adventure</name>
									
			<description>Taken from the tag line.&lt;br/&gt;An RPG for Pre-Schoolers&lt;br/&gt;You bring the dungeon, we'll bring the monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taken from the About Dungeon Adventure introductory paragraph.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As any parent knows, kids are great at creating worlds and situations for their toys to live in. These worlds are only limited by their imagination, but if you watch children play you will see them constantly switch gears mentally and move from one encounter to the next. Most of their play resembles dreams that are sometimes exhilarating, but at the same time frustrating. It is almost like kids are looking for something in this play that they can't quite grasp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think what they are looking for are rules and obstacles to overcome. When anything is possible, nothing is remarkable. When a stuffed bear can fly up the stairs and rescue his friends without any doubt as to the outcome, there is no mental reward in that success. Video games provide real obstacles and metrics to show progress, and kids gravitate toward them as soon as they are able to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My daughter and I developed the Dungeon Adventure as a way to use her toys as a framework for creating achievement. We built a dungeon out of blocks, filled it with unseen monsters and treasures, and I asked her to select three heroes and go on a quest. Buzz, Kermit, and a robot saved twin babies from a dragon that day and we've been playing ever since. She asks to play almost every day and we try to incorporate new elements into each game (multi-level dungeons, locked chests, etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Added by the submitter.&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Adventure is distributed as a ZIP package that includes three PDF files.  One file is the main set of rules (6 pages), the second is a set of cut out cards (4 pages), and the third is a sheet for tracking hit points (1 page).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
