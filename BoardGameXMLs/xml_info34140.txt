			<description>Content:&lt;br/&gt;1 board&lt;br/&gt;40 fairytale cards&lt;br/&gt;16 fairy cards (8 good fairy, 8 evil fairy)&lt;br/&gt;1 bright magic wand for good fairies,&lt;br/&gt;1 dark magic wand for evil fairies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a series of fairytale cards with numbers 1-10, 2 good fairies, 2 evil fairies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea is: &lt;br/&gt;Each player shuffles his 14 cards and lays them as a hidden deck in front of him at the table.&lt;br/&gt;At his turn the player draws an own card and tries to place it onto a field with the same number. &lt;br/&gt;If the opened card is an evil fairy he takes his dark magic wand and turns an discarded card face down. Here no card may be laid until a good fairy turns it back open again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who can discard his hand first wins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
