			<description>OOF-DAH! is an American Specialty tabletop boardgame for 2-4 players.  It has educational content, but is really meant to be a lot of fun.  The theme is based on organic farming, and the goal is to collect Hunger Tokens by growing organic vegetables on your farm.  If you play strategically and negotiate successful trades with other Growers, you can increase your odds of doing well at the Farmer's Market, which dictates crop values and market pricing.  &lt;br/&gt;Game-play is turn-based die rolls, accompanied by trading among Growers between turns.  Multiple events may occur on die rolls, however, and it is up to Growers to keep track of these.  A Grower may score an OOF-DAH! if the grow the right crops on the right cover crops, and if they plant the correct crops during the growing season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
