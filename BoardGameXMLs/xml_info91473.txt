			<description>Fidchess Qenqe is an attempt to modify Fidchess so that it works for more than two players, with additional changes to make it a different game. Qenqe is five in proto-Celtic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number of players: 2&amp;ndash;5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game: Be the first player to capture an opponent's Rigant, or causes an opponent to be reduced to only controlling Rigant (because all their disks are in stacks of other players or off the board).&lt;br/&gt;Getting Started&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment: Stonehenge board, using all 30 spaces of outer track, and is considered four spaces wide for this game. All 50 disks in the game. All 5 non-neutral figures (Rigants).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ending the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has either captured an opponent's Rigant, or causes an opponent to be reduced to only controlling Rigant (because all their disks are in stacks of other players or off the board), the player wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
