			<description>A game that appeared in The Economist Magazine's Christmas 2008 issue. It is also available a print and play game from The Economist's Web site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Economist:&amp;quot;As though readers haven't suffered enough already this year, we are offering them a chance to be crushed, humiliated, and impoverished all over again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But we are also offering a shot at redemption. Our Board game pits players against each other and encourages them to pick on the weakest, kick opponents when they are down and generally manifest all the characteristics that bring success in the financial world. WINNER TAKES ALL!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move round by throwing four coins and progressing as many squares as they throw heads. If a player throws four heads, he moves forward four spaces and has another turn; if he throws four tails, he throws again. When a player lands on a + square, he collects money from the bank; equally, when he lands on a minus square, he pays the bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to be the last solvent player. In order to achieve this, players try to eliminate the competition. Risk cards encourage players to pick on each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
