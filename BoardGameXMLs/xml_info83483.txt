			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using clues given on each of the game cards, players place nine teddy bear markers of three different colours in their proper spaces.  The clues offer rules for the particular game card.  For example, the clues may state that a blue bear sits after a red bear, or that a green bear cannot sit after a blue bear.  The players, then, must use logic in order to solve the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are eleven different puzzles included in the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played solo, cooperative or competitively.  In the competitive mode, players divide the bears amongst themselves.  On a turn, the player will roll the colour die and may place a bear of that colour on the puzzle.  Making a wrong placement results in a two turn penalty.  The player to correctly place his last bear on the puzzle wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
