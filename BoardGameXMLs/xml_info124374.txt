							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lizardman Lodge</name>
									
			<description>From publisher burb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today we stopped to trade, and shared a brief meal as well with the lizardmen of this valley. Most extraordinary people. Creatures. Beings. However you would address them. Although primitive, they have the most amazing mind for simple engineering. This, and the surrounding valleys you see, have a large number of predatory creatures. Medium dinosaurs, Jungle Cats, even those vicious little piranha birds can all be found in abundance here. A harsh living, but these lizardmen have found a way to protect their homes, without having to live up in the mountains in caves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
