							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Over the Edge</name>
									
			<description>Each player has seven pawns on opposite sides of a board with 31 spaces joined hexagonally. One end of the board, perpendicular to the two starting pawn rows, is a pit which players try to force their opponent's pieces into. A player can move any of his pawns provided they are adjacent to at least one other friendly pawn. A player's group can also drag away and control adjacent opposing pieces as long as the opposing piece is kept away from it's allies. Win by putting three of your opponent's pawns &amp;quot;over the edge&amp;quot; of the pit or by separating all opponent's pawns thus immobilizing them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
