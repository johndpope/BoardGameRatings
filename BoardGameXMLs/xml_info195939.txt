							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">It&#039;s Spring Again</name>
									
			<description>An educational app for children ages two and up. It uses game mechanics to teach children about the seasons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The app is intended to develop associational and logical thinking. By following the hints, children help the seasons change. They learn the order of the seasons and create a melody for each of them with a little help from their parents and the narrator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;laquo;It&amp;rsquo;s Spring Again&amp;raquo; is based on a successful puppet show for children ages 2 to 5, in which puppets controlled by actors showed children audience the magic of change of seasons.&lt;br/&gt;The game enriches the show by allowing children to directly interact with the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;laquo;The Forest Raised a Christmas Tree&amp;raquo; puppet show Premiered in December 2013 &lt;br/&gt;Directed by Tamara Volynkina &lt;br/&gt;Production Designer Asya Yurina &lt;br/&gt;Puppet Theater of Murmansk Oblast&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ekaterina Efremova&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The voice actor of the game&amp;rsquo;s narrator is a wonderful actress and a musician.
