							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Pitfall</name>
									
			<description>From back of US NES edition box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join Pitfall Harry as he searches a vast subterranean cave dwelling high in the Andes. Harry's mission is simple -- recover the Raj diamond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interested in helping out? Perhaps a few details, before you volunteer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll have to be in great shape. The full extent of these caves is unknown, and you must be prepared to explore every square foot to succeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, a little dirt, a few cuts and bruises and total physical exhaustion don't scare you? OK, how about poisonous frogs, bats, snakes, scorpions, tarantulas, cave-men, lava pits and deadly condors?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, did we forget to mention Harry's niece, Rhonda, and his faithful companion, Quickclaw the Lion? They're both trapped below and must be saved before you can leave the caves. Just a minor complication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Still with us? Good. Because it gets better and better -- over 270 screens loaded with danger and adventure. New enemies and challenges at every turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sound like your cup of tea? Then step forward and join Pitfall Harry in the greatest adventure of his career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
