Leaving a trail of extinct or dying species behind them it was only a matter of time before the few remaining civilisations banded together and fought the Star Kings in a final climactic battle around their homeworld.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now it is the age of the Thermal Wars, the Terran Empire has conquered vast tracts of space and fought many savage long wars with strange alien races. Out in the wilds of the frontier, during one of the long periods between the age old wars, the Star Patrol help maintain some semblance of order. The frigate Rocinate is on peacekeeping mission when it stumbles across a long forgotten world and accidentally awakens ancient war machines that have been dormant for millions of years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Planet Kills campaign for Starblazer Adventures, characters will be drawn in to a tale of revenge on a galactic scale! The campaign features awe inspiring galactic engineering projects, vast ancient relics to explore, massive war machines, an aeons old plot, incredibly alien technology, desperate pitched battles and a terrifying twist in the tale!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Planet Killers is perfect for Gritty or Standard starting characters and you can easily scale the encounters. Although a detailed plot is provided, the campaign also makes use of the Collaborative Campaign Creation system from Starblazer Adventures allowing players to be more involved in the history and mysteries of the Star Kings so that the campaign can be tailored exactly to their tastes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll also find plenty of additional plot twists and story ideas for the incredible locations provided in the campaign for hours of additional game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;this Item was added to (Unpublished Products) on April 29, 2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
