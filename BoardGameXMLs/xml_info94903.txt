							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Royal Geographical Pastime or the Complete Tour of Europe</name>
									
			<description>A board game using a map of Europe with a city-to-city path of spaces from Dover (#1) to London (#103).&lt;br/&gt;Players roll an 8-sided teetotum (because dice were heavily taxed at the time) and move along the path. Each space is a city in Europe, with a description given on the edge of the board. Some spaces have a favourable or unfavourable penalty (miss a turn, advance, go back etc).&lt;br/&gt;e.g. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;63. Florence - The capital of Tuscany, the residence of the Grand duke.&lt;br/&gt;64. Rome. the Traveller, who is supposed to have indiscreetly kissed the Pope's toe, must be banished to Bergen, in Norway (No.11) and miss four turns.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;To win a layer must land exactly on London. If he overthrows, he returns to Paris. (#86) and tries again.&lt;br/&gt;Like the traditional Game of goose, there is a prison space (Algiers #68) and a death space (Scilly #89).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
