							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cities of Aden</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Darkfall brought the Known Lands to the brink of ruin, with countless settlements destroyed on that terrible day, and more during the chaos that followed. Those villages, towns, and cities that have survived have been forced to become bastions of strength and military power, standing against the hordes of nocturnals like beacons in the darkness. These are the destinations that bring respite to weary adventurers, allowing them to barter their spoils of war for new and exciting equipment! But they are dangerous as well, and some may find that the nocturnals are a much more straightforward foe than their fellow survivors!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cities of Aden includes details on twelve of the Known Lands' most intriguing settlements, as well as an assortment of eight new Traits that players can use to create a character from one of these vibrant towns!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
