							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rocket Riot</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strap on your bazooka soldier, and get ready for the awesome action-packed side-view shooter Rocket Riot. In this highly stylized eight-bit era style game, blast your way through the environment against enemies or multiplayer foes online. Navigate through a completely destructible environment, uncover special power-ups, or even burrow into different areas of the map. The map regenerates, keeping the action fast-paced, but time doesn't heal all wounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Missions: Engage in 80 single-player missions of progressively increasing difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;    * Multiplayer: Rocket through four multiplayer modes against up to eight players on Xbox Live or up to four players on a single screen.&lt;br/&gt;    * Customization: Customize your soldier by selecting his color, armor, and more.&lt;br/&gt;    * Environments: Fly through continuously regenerating maps that keep the action fast-paced -- but time won't heal all environmental wounds.&lt;br/&gt;    * Power-ups: Discover tons of power-ups to give your character destructive powers or humorous disadvantages, from guided rockets and massive block destruction to rocket magnetism, and dizzy missiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
