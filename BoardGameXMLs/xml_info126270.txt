			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine if you were the last person alive in the solar system. What if the reason you were all alone was that your friends, family, and billions of others from all worlds had to flee to a nearby solar system to escape from colliding stars. Suppose, though, that the cataclysmic event prophesied didn't destroy all life after all. What if the opposite happened and previously uninhabitable planets could now support life? What would you do if you were the only witness to these things? How would you share your secret? And what if the Government in the new system planned all along to enslave your brethren once they arrived and would do anything to keep your secret from getting out? Would you have the courage to help bring freedom no matter what the cost? You'll get your chance in Sui Juris, Emancipation, a futuristic, on the edge, thrill ride that mixes a perfect blend of role playing with that of a card game. You'll get the best of both worlds like the rich storylines and plot progression, character choice, non player characters, and the chance of dice roll typical of an RPG, and the collecting, strategy and combat of a card play. Plus, you will be immersed in an incredibly vivid and imaginative world rich in history and background. All you need is a SuiGuideBook, a pair of percentile dice, and a volume full of cards. You can bring your own and add to the deck or play with a friend&amp;rsquo;s book. Enter a realm unlike any other and experience the passion of becoming a beacon of hope in an otherwise dark and dangerous region of space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
