			<description>Rocca Classic is a hexagon-shaped card game designed to look like a cube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play original games Card Tower and Rocca The Monster.&lt;br/&gt;It has the same deck as ordinary playing cards, so traditional card games such as poker and sevens can be played with it, too. Rocca has another face that is to be used as flat building blocks that give us an optical illusion of a three-dimensional blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Card Tower is to be the first player to run out of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card Monster (4-6 players) has two objectives. It is similar to the game Werewolf. The player with the monster card tries to kill more than half the village before being caught.  The villagers try to kill the monster before more than half of them are caught.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
