			<description>Objective: Gain most victory points by bringing home as many of your pawns (geese, ducks, chicken, young chicken) as possible - or as fox: catch many them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll &amp;amp; Move Game, best with (4) 5 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players move around the same board like Pachisi; board is divided 10 segments with 6 spaces each. Payers are forced to start with a second pawn as soon as the first has left first segment. After a complete round a turnable fox (in the centre of the board) is spun - the segment he's pointing on is in danger: each involved player has a saving throw escaping into next segment - otherwise the pawn is caught by the fox. Depending on order of running in victory points are granted. Slight modifications with 4 or 3 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
