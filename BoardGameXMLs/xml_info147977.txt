							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Perfidious Albion: Spain vs. Britain</name>
									
			<description>Two siege battles of the 18th century pitting Spain vs. Britain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A low complexity simulation of 18th century sieges. Rules will cover mortars, wall breaches, sorties, parallel lines, naval gunfire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two battles depicted are:&lt;br/&gt;Cartagena 1741: British Armada. The English sent a fleet against Cartagena de Indias, the key to the Panama isthmus. Composed of 186 ships, with 2,600 guns and some 10,000 troops, the plan was to cut in two the Spanish Empire in the Americas. The fortress was defended by 3,000 Spanish troops and six ships of the line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Havana 1762. The largest port of Cuba, Havana, was attacked in June 1762 by a large English fleet (53 ships of the line, 15,000 troops, 10,000 sailors). At the peace conference, Spain had to cede Florida to the British to regain Havana.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
