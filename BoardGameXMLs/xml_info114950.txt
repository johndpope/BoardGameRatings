			<description>From the tape cassette inlay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1984&lt;br/&gt;The British Economy with YOU at the controls! What sort of Chancellor would you make with several billion pounds to spend &amp;amp; five years to the next general election? Graphic Displays, Histograms &amp;amp; a annual performance rating are all included to show how you are doing. How many years will you last?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1984 - GOVERNMENT MANAGEMENT&lt;br/&gt;How many times have you seen politicians on TV and thought &amp;quot;I could do better myself!&amp;quot;? Well 1984, the new game from Incentive Software, challenges you to do just that! Starting with the 1982/3 figures for the British economy you take the hot seat and the responsibility of guiding the nation's affairs. You will be asked to bring your judgement to bear on the complex inter-related network of factors that govern the performance of the national economy. Can you ride out three terms of office and survive into the 21st Century? Can you weather two General Elections? Will your Britain conquer Unemployment and inflation simultaneously? Or will you be forced to resign...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
