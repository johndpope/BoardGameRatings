			<description>Smash or Trash is a hilarious new game where players get to make up new lyrics to songs they love.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players get a song card with a choice of 4 popular songs from today as well as the 70s, 80s, and 90s.  Once they choose a song, they get a Subject card and the fun begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then begin rewriting the lyrics to the song they chose about the subject they receive.  There is a timer, and you can write as much or as little as you like in the allotted time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once everyone finishes writing, its time to &amp;quot;perform&amp;quot; your new song.  This is the part I love.  Everyone take a turn singing (or just reading) their new lyrics.  Needless to say, the results can be extremely funny and usually have people laughing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can write as much or as little as you want - and still win.  For example, my niece had the subject Roadkill and the song Brick House - all she wrote was &amp;quot;It was a dead, mouse!&amp;quot; and she won the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After everyone performs or reads their new song, everyone becomes a critic (think Simon Cowell).  Players secretly give Smash point cards or Trash (funny insult) cards to the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The points each player receives during the round are recorded, and after playing as many rounds as you want - the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best thing about this game is the memories it creates.  And players can take their songs home with them and share them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
