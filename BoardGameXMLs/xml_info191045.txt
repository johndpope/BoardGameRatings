			<description>The game's battle system is similar to the battle system found in Valkyria Chronicles.It features turn-based battles, with character order based on individual speed. The parties are assembled within a deck and controls in battle have been compared to those of an action game. The special attacks of the characters are unlocked based on their trust in Lux, the game's protagonist, and by defeating enemies more special moves can be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Lord of Magna: Maiden Heaven&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
