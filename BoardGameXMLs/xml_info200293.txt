							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Katanas &amp; Trenchcoats, Episode 7: Celestial Boogaloo</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Katanas &amp;amp; Trenchcoats, Episode 1: Welcome to Darkest Vancouver, you got to meet its Immortal population and get a little bit of sweetness around vampires, werebeasts, ghosts, vypers, and more. Katanas &amp;amp; Trenchcoats, Episode 7: Celestial Boogaloo adds some sweet and spicy to that sauce with the power of angels and demons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's right, welcome to Darkest Heaven and Deepest Hell. God got fed up with angels constantly being angry about the Fallen&amp;mdash;that doesn't make for a chill vibe&amp;mdash;so He left and took most of the cool angels with Him. You probably have an idea of what Heaven's like after that. Hell, on the other hand, is a con artist rave that's gotten too crowded, and demons love to get the hell out of Dodge and roam the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This completely original RPG supplement is inspired by prophetic works like Supernatural, The Prophecy (1-3 only; to hell with 4), Constantine (not as bad a movie as some make it out to be, I swear; Swinton and Stormare were amazing), and holy texts like Paradise Lost (at least the wikiquotes edition) and In Nomine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think of Celestial Boogaloo as the Book of Leviticus for the Katanas &amp;amp; Trenchcoats-verse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
