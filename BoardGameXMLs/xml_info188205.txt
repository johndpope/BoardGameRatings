							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sleeper: Orphans of the Cold War</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains all the rules and background needed to run a game of Sleeper. This includes rules for adjudicating combat and risky actions, several pre-generated characters and rules for making your own, advice for the GM, equipment and powers that can be given to players, and a system for increasing player characters&amp;rsquo; capabilities by researching and developing new weapons and gear. It also includes lots of information on the world of Sleeper and the factions who inhabit it, including Obsidian, the organisation to which the player characters are assumed to belong. It includes many enemies to throw at the PCs, both generic soldiers and other enemies to be used as required and named characters from the Sleeper background. It also has a sample mission, which can both be played straight out of the book and used as an example of the kind of action-packed military-style adventures Sleeper characters find themselves on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
