							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">UNO: WWE Card Game</name>
									
			<description>It's the fun, fast-paced card game you love now featuring iconic characters from the thrilling WWE! Players race to get rid of all their cards by matching a card in their hand with the current card shown on top of the deck. When you throw down the powerful Locked Up card, you choose another player with whom you'll lock into battle. Only one will survive! Other action cards include Skips, Reverses, Draw Twos, and Wild Cards-including a customizable Wild Card. The first player or team to 500 wins, and when you're down to one card, don't forget to yell &amp;quot;UNO!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
