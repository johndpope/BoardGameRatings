							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Thing in the Cellar</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Friendly monsters work together to solve a Halloween mystery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The guests will be playing the roles of monsters sharing a haunted house. Every year, the monsters open their home on 213 Elm Street to the public on Halloween for a fright-filled haunted house tour. They use the proceeds from the haunted house to buy household supplies for the rest of year, during which time the house stays boarded up and we stay inside. If the townspeople ever discovered the monsters in the haunted house were real, they would certainly drive them away &amp;ndash; or worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of the haunted house hinges on a climactic scene in the cellar, when The Thing is revealed. Advertised for hundreds of miles on every billboard in every direction &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;See The Thing!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;What is The Thing? See for Yourself!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; thrill-seekers and the merely curious come from distant cities to see The Thing, and it never disappoints. Those who have seen The Thing eagerly attest that it is the scariest sight they have witnessed in their entire lives. No one seems able to describe The Thing, and they all agree: you have to see it for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
