			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;Fascinating and completely different, THE GOURMET GAME takes you to fine international restaurants to dine in the grande manner. The object of the game is to win gourmet awards by composing meals from a variety of mouth-watering dishes.&lt;br/&gt;Each player has his own board, which is in the form of a menu. Dishes include classic haute cuisine and are name in English and French (you'll soon learn the French words and their correct pronunciation). Six cards are dealt to each player, and as a player takes new cards from the deck or does discarded by his opponents he gradually puts together a gourmet meal. To win, however, he must order the right dishes and beverages, and must prevent other players from ordering. Both skill and luck are required. A budget of $100 and other restrictions make the game all the more exciting. Two to six may play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
