							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mad Science Foundation</name>
									
			<description>Throughout the centuries, mad scientists have always encountered the same problem of very limited access to the dangerous resources they require. To solve this problem, the Mad Science Foundation was created. Now these &amp;quot;misunderstood geniuses&amp;quot; can finally get the access they need to the four vital building blocks of mad science: Lasers, Dark Matter, Cryptomium, and Sharks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, for each mad scientist who seeks &amp;quot;funding&amp;quot; from the Mad Science Foundation, there remains the unfortunate fact of life that mad scientists do not play well with others. In the quest for infamy, directors will be bribed, resources will be reallocated, spies will be dispatched, inventions will be sabotaged, and big, ominous buttons will be pressed with catastrophic results. Welcome to the Mad Science Foundation, where everyone is ready to stab you in the back with overly-elaborate backstabbing machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At heart, Mad Science Foundation is a drafting game. You draft resources to craft wacky inventions and dispatch minions to help with your diabolical plans. Each round, one player controls the Crooked Director for that round. They then separate the available commodities into piles to be drafted. It's up to the scientist controlling the Director to determine the value of whatever resources are available and separate them into piles. Not all piles are created equal! Players then take turns selecting which pile of goodies to grab, with the Director's controller choosing last. Sizing up your competition is key! You know what they need; don't let them have it. Or give them two choices of equal terrible-ness! But each player also has a secret side objective that you may not figure out until it's too late...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By crafting new inventions, you might be able to put together an engine of cards that eventually fuel themselves. Perpetual motion in our lifetime! Or perhaps you might stockpile valuable resources for later exploitation. It's all done with the altruistic goals of megalomania and personal glory in mind. What could go wrong?*&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Mad Science Foundation is not responsible for stock market crashes, illegal dumping, or tears in the fabric of space-time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
