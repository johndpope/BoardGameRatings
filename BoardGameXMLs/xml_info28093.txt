			<description>(Back of box):PUT THE WORLD IN YOUR HANDS with this great new educational family card game! No matter what your age or education level, no matter how little or how much you know about geography, you can be equally competitive. Parents and children can play and learn together. Prepare for an upcoming vacation or sharpen your knowledge for a business trip. Or just relax and have fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a card for each country on the Asian Realm and each body of water bounding the Asian Realm, as well as wild cards and super wild cards. Each player must play a card whose geographic location shares a boundary with the card that was last played. Bluffing and using wild cards add strategy to the play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exciting and educational for 2-8 players, ages 9 years to senior citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
