			<description>Tottoko Hamutaro: Tomodachi Daisakusen Dechu (とっとこハム太郎: ともだち大作戦でちゅ) is a Game Boy Color video game released by Nintendo. The game was the first in Nintendo's Hamtaro series, and was released exclusively in Japan (whereas future entries in the series would make their way to North America and Europe). The game is based on the books that were released in Japan under the Hamtaro name. In the game you have conversations with Hamtaro.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike its successors, this game uses a real-time internal clock that keeps track of the current time. Also the player does not control Hamtaro or follow Hamtaro on his adventure, which he take from time to time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://hamtaro.wikia.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://hamtaro.wikia.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
