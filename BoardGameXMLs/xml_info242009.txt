			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemy ships have surrounded your space station, firing deadly torpedoes in an attempt to break down your shields and destroy the station!  You've got to rotate your laser turret and fire quickly, especially when they attack from all four quadrants at once!  Then, without warning, an orbiting bomber spirals in.  Can you rotate and get him before he crashes into you?  Star Zap! is another fast arcade game from John Wilson, with color and sound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
