							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Riddle of the Sphinx</name>
									
			<description>From the Game Manual / Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pharaoh's kingdom languishes under a vile curse.  his son, Egypt's heir, travels  across the Valley of the Kings.  To lift the curse he must reach the temple of Ra with priceless treasures.  He must solve the Riddle of the Sphinx.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He barters with nomad traders.  Some give him gifts and artifacts useful to him on his journey.  Some steal.&lt;br/&gt;Armed  only with a sling and rocks, the Son of Egypt combats  marauding thieves and deadly scorpions.  His trials earn him  inner strength.  Oases refresh his thirst.  Time heals his wounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approaching sacred monuments--Pyramids, the Temples of Isis and  Anubis, the inscrutable Sphinx--Pharaoh's Prince seeks to make the correct offering. &lt;br/&gt;If he fails to do so, he may not be able to move further or receive priceless objects in exchange.  If he pleases the gods, his inner strength points grow greater and his store of treasures increases.  He advances toward the Temple of Ra, source of light and life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once there, he hopes to possess the treasure that will open the Temple to him, liberating Egypt of Anubis' fierce curse.&lt;br/&gt;These things weigh on the young Prince.  He reviews his purpose:  to lift the curse and prove himself a worthy successor to Pharaoh, he must:&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;gt; Gain as many inner strength points as possible&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;gt; Complete his quest as rapidly as he can&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;gt; Collect all the treasures he can find&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;gt; Reach the Temple of Ra&lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;The Son of Pharaoh girds his loins.  He prepares to confront his fate on the timeless sands that are Egypt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
