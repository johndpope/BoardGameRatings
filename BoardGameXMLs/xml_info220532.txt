			<description>The discovery of Pearl Lands, a galaxy with abundant resources, changed the face of the space race forever. Fleets traveled to Pearl Lands to transport new red shiny Pearl resource to our solar system, an adventure that was not possible before the use of Pearl extensively in every part of space technology. And the gift of Pearl Lands was not limited to Pearl! A green rain made of grain, discovered on a Pearl Lands&amp;rsquo; planet, created a new energy source for space technologies, and a curious little yellow flower with beautiful petals provided Mana, a seed to be cultivated with utmost care. So, with these three new resources previously unknown to mankind, space travel to the farthest points of the Pearl Lands galaxy became a reality, and with the establishment of colony after colony Pearl Lands has become a new home for mankind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, war has never ended. With the use of new technologies, it just became more sophisticated. Fights for planets turned into a fight for resources, whether by using fire power or trade channels. Prosperity was never enough for mankind. There was always more to gain, and more to develop. Now it's your turn to join the race. Trade, fight and build future technologies. Power is a beautiful thing, so make sure you have it all&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pearl Lands is a 2-5 player resource management strategy game with a sci-fi theme in which you compete to build three main resource buildings before other players. It&amp;rsquo;s a fast paced game that gets more and more intense with each passing turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has different strategy elements like attacking opponents to steal their resources, trading resources with players or the bank, and using universe cards to change the course of the game (sometimes just slightly and sometimes drastically). Its combat mechanics is similar to Risk, while trade aspect gives it more like a Catan style strategy element. However there is no tile or troop movement factor that complicate things: it&amp;rsquo;s designed to be fun and straightforward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pearl Lands is full of surprises: the game can turn even at the last round. However it&amp;rsquo;s not a game of pure luck. The player with long term winning strategy will definitely have the upper hand, and most likely will be the target of other players banding together against her. Alliances are of the utmost importance. Cunning players will find the game to their liking, but utilizing only the art of deception may not be enough to win the game. Sometimes desperate measures like a kamikaze attack to destroy five resource crystals by sacrificing an attack ship can change the balance of power. And buying universe cards can pay off greatly if you get one extra attack or defense die, or get to change the resource setup on the board to sabotage an opponent's game plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
