							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Terrax Warriors</name>
									
			<description>Terrax is a world of conflicts and magic, and while kings and lords fight for lands and power, some adventurers with their warbands are fighting for the many gold veins found all around Terrax. In this board game, players take the role of these adventurers, and fight other players with the same greedy goal. This game is about fighting tactics, wise character movements and actions, and destroying your enemy's characters. Use every warrior in your warband at their best, and you have good chances of winning some of the riches of Terrax.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a team of mercenaries from these 6 groups : Amazons, men, elves, dwarves, orcs, and goblins. Each group has a different feel and playstyle. The goal is to conquer and exploit, on a randomly placed game board, the gold veins that will make you rich. But the fight is hard to get what you want. The tension is all around the battlefield, every place where there is gold needs to be taken, and protected. Move your characters and attack, cast spells, heal the injured, move to conquer ungarded veins... When you have enough gold, hire more mercenaries to help you fight harder, and protect more gold veins. The goal of Terrax Warriors is to take out one player after the other, until only you remain in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Website :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.darvexgames.com/TerraxWarriors.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.darvexgames.com/TerraxWarriors.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is now a FREE PC version of the board game, downloadable on the website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
