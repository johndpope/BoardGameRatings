			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Level 4 Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A conflict at the end of time! On the eve of the winter solstice, long-banished giants from the frozen void strive to complete a ceremony that will cause an endless winter to envelope the world. The adventurers find themselves torn from existence, stripped of not only their equipment, but their very memories, and summoned to the far edge of the world to repair an ancient temple of time. Will you recover your abilities and solve the challenges of the world clock before the end of time itself?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An exploration-based adventure taking the characters deep into the icy depths of unknown, Twilight of the Solstice tests the player&amp;rsquo;s ability to confront the challenges of the harsh winter setting while also unraveling the singular puzzle of their own identity. Faced with limited knowledge and time, only the most crafty - and lucky - can hope to defeat the returned agents of primeval chaos and restore events to their proper course!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original print edition of this module included scratch-off character sheets! This PDF edition includes a PDF of that sheet, plus a special separate file that allows the judge to randomly generate up to 10 pregenerated characters which can be used to simulate the scratch off aspect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
