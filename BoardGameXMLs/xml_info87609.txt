			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DragonFable is Artix Entertainments second Massively-Single-Player RPG. DragonFable features a fully animated player that can move about the screen and travel from area to area instead of the static point and click of AdventureQuest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like AdventureQuest, the game is free to play and updated weekly with events, new items ot other advences. But without the server limitations. Players that upgrade gain access to more class skills and special side quests and equipment. Paying players also gain access to their dragon companion's juvenile and titan forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DragonFable differs from AdventureQuest also in that it tells an ongoing story that takes the player across the land. Player participation is again compiled to complet wars and other important events. The game retains the odd humor and parodies, though usually less off the wall than in its predecessor. Level grinding is still excessive though.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also features a new pseudo PVP arena where you may battle other players characters run by a battle AI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
