			<description>Firelord is an action-adventure game released in 1986 for ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64 by Hewson Consultants and was developed by Stephen Crow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls the knight Sir Galaheart, who must explore the opressed kingdom of Torot on a quest to recover the four charms of eternal youth.  A sorceress known as the Evil Queen has tricked a good dragon into parting with the sacred Firestone and used it to curse the kingdom with ghostly apparitions and deadly fireballs, and will only relinquish it in exchange for the four charms that would keep her long forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galaheart is initially defenceless and must quickly find an enchanted crystal in order to defend himself against the cursed apparitions the Evil Queen has flooded the kingdom with.  He must then explore the kingdom destroying apparations and looking for clues to the location of the four charms.  Galaheart can trade with various inhabitants for spells, information and items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galaheart has a constantly depleting energy level which is sapped further by contact with the apparitions and which can be restored by collecting food, &amp;quot;trading energy&amp;quot; which is depleted during trading and can be restored by collecting trading tokens and weapon energy which is depleted by firing and can be restored by collecting small crystals.  Galaheart has an initial allocation of lives which can be lost by running out of energy, colliding with a fireball or being caught attempting to steal during trading - this leads to a &amp;quot;trial&amp;quot; in which the player has to attempt to stop on &amp;quot;innocent&amp;quot; rather than &amp;quot;guilty&amp;quot; with three successively faster alternating arrows.  Extra lives can be found scattered throughout the kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the game ends (either through successfully returning the Firestone or losing all the lives) the player is ranked in a pseudo-medieaval ranking from serf through various English titles of nobility up to the ultimate accolade of &amp;quot;Firelord&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Firelord (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
