			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The PCs travel to a desert world long past its prime, with a dimly receding civilization and a diverse but strangely interconnected ecosystem. When geological surveys indicated the presence of oil and precious minerals within the mantle, human settlements began to spring up all over the planet, leaving only one large portion of untamed wilderness: a vast sea of red sand bordered on the south by occupied territory, and on the north by the Hraefnian Hills.  Here among the dessicated remains of a once-thriving world, humans met, fought, and conquered the alien race known as &amp;ldquo;Owlies&amp;rdquo;. In the years that have passed since then the aboriginals, once regarded as barely sentient and used as slaves both here and on Earth, have begun to gain their civil rights. But not all earthlings see this issue the same way.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs are inserted into a social struggle between two widely different races; which side will they support?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HUNTER/HUNTED is a DayTrippers Adventure from the GOLDEN AGE ADVENTURES anthology.  If you have that book, you don't need this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DayTrippers uses a descriptive scale which can easily be converted to other game systems.  Conversions are included for 2-12, 1-20, PbtA and percentage-based systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
