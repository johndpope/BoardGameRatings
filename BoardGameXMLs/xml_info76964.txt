			<description>Jane's F-15 is a study combat flight simulation game modeling United States all-weather strike fighter F-15E Strike Eagle. The game had two campaigns: one based on the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq, and the other focusing on fictional conflict with Iran. Jane's F/A-18 used an improved version of F-15's game engine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game supported 3Dfx graphics, and later a patch was released to support D3D graphics. The virtual cockpit was one of the first of its kind, but the game still featured a 2D cockpit which also allowed the player to switch between the pilot and WSO (Weapons Systems Officer) seat in the back of the cockpit to monitor the different multi-functional displays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Jane's F-15,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
