			<description>The title derives from a German phrase, meaning something ordinary. (Originally it came from a machine gun, used a lot in World War I, and was made popular because of a bestselling war novel and film of this title.) The game however is an abstract speed game. It consists of 108 cards in 9 colours, denoted &amp;quot;0&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;8&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;15&amp;quot;. Goal for each player is to collect the most card sets in one colour, consisting of one card of each number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decks of each number are separated. &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;15&amp;quot; are each shuffled, and put as two face up stack on the table. &amp;quot;8&amp;quot; cards are shared evenly among players, and put as face down stacks in front of them. Determined by numbers of players, a given number of &amp;quot;8&amp;quot; cards are revealed from each players deck, and everybody tries to match the two face up cards from the common decks with their tableau. If they find the &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; matching to one of their &amp;quot;8&amp;quot;, they put it below their card. A matching &amp;quot;15&amp;quot; they put on top of their &amp;quot;8&amp;quot;. Once a set is complete, it is removed into a victory point pile and another &amp;quot;8&amp;quot; from the players deck takes it place. Game ends, as soon the decks are depleted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
