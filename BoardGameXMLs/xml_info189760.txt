			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ptolus Sketchbook line is a great resource for players and DMs to &amp;quot;See&amp;quot; more of the City by the Spire. Created by the artists who set the architectural tone for the Ptolus book, every sketchbook focuses on a different district. Together they expand Ptolus with illustrations of buildings not pictured in the core book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's in a Ptolus Sketchbook?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Building illustrations inspired by Monte's descriptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Illustrations of details which could be found in the featured buildings (signs, furniture, typical items).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Blank handouts of letters, advertisements, etc. which can be easily customized to your needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every Ptolus Sketchbook from The Forge Studios consists of two parts. The first one is stylized and consists of illustrations made on a parchment background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second part is a set of black and white illustrations which can be easily printed or presented to players during a session, in order to enrich the locale's description and create a more precise presentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ptolus Sketchbook vol. 6: Nobles' Quarter is the sixth part of a series illustrating Monte Cook's City by the Spire.
