			<description>Crystal Towers 2 is a 90s-styled hub-based sort of Metroidish-Mario 64ish platform game, in which you guide Bernard the monk around a collection of varied worlds on a quest to recover the eight crystals that hold the kingdom's music. Players can choose their route through the game as levels are slowly unlocked by completing challenges. By gathering new spells and abilities as the game goes on, and occasionally being assisted by two sort of cat-things, it's Bernard's job to restore harmony to the Music Castle once more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
