							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Apocalyptia V2.0</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the second edition of Apocalyptia, an open-source tabletop roleplaying game about The End. The setting is our world in the not-too-distant future. There are 12 distinct apocalyptic Scenarios presented here, each with unique challenges and opportunities. Character development is not really about leveling up stats, but rather the characters themselves change as they grow, getting better at some things while getting rusty in others. They struggle for survival and sanity as friends and loved ones die all around them. Individual prowess is never as important as the support of your Team, your Faction, and your Settlement. Ultimately, the game is about overcoming those things that have divided humanity for so long, and coming together to build a better world out of the rubble of the old.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only die you need to play Apocalyptia is a d6. The game is designed to be a military-style simulation with the intention of balancing system crunchiness with fast-paced play. The book is written with a lot of system abbreviations to pack as much game content into this small package as possible. For best results, the Game Narrator should be experienced with common roleplaying game concepts and become comfortable with the rules since the majority of the work of running the game is placed on the Narrator. Character creation usually takes 20 minutes or less, which is good since the mortality rate is rather high in the Wasteland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy random Area and Encounter generation procedures&lt;br/&gt;    Detailed Equipment lists, mods, and vehicles for those who love to Scavenge for Loot&lt;br/&gt;    Over 100 unique non-player characters and creatures in 12 different Apocalyptic Scenarios&lt;br/&gt;    Realistic tactical combat and survival based on real-world techniques&lt;br/&gt;    Faction Bases and inter-Faction relations, including Faction Warfare&lt;br/&gt;    Rules for building Team Bases and entire Settlement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this second edition of the game, the rules have been cleaned up, balanced, and expanded to allow as many options as players and game narrators can imagine. Additional artwork, game mechanics, and setting content gives greater detail and increased possibilities for your Apocalyptic adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF is formatted to make printing easy. Each page is 8.5&amp;quot; x 5.5&amp;quot; so that two pages can be printed on each side of a standard sheet of printer paper, allowing the easy printing of Apocalyptia manuals with common printer booklet settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
