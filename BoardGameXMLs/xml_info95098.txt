							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Ages Basic Rules</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following basic rules for the Dark Ages line are intended to allow players to use any of the hardcover supplementary rulebooks (Dark Ages: Mage, Dark Ages: Werewolf, Dark Ages: Inquisitor and Dark Ages: Fae) without having to purchase Dark Ages: Vampire. These rules have been exerpted from Dark Ages: Vampire, but have had most vampire-specific information and rules removed. They contain only the basics of the game system, stripped of optional rules and much supplementary advice and material. With this in mind, those wishing to play a Dark Ages: Vampire chronicle should use that book instead, as many important vampire-specific details have been removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of this material is taken from Dark Ages: Vampire. Some of the weapons and combat systems are taken from the Spoils of War sourcebook. We'd like to thank the authors of those books for their work and dedication. Special thanks go to Matthew J. Rourke for compiling the Dark Ages rules into this document.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
