							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Droog Family Songbook</name>
									
			<description>From the text:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Droog Family Songbook is a roleplaying game inspired by the Movie Mashup game design competition, hosted by 1km1kt.net.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular game is inspired by the films A Clockwork Orange and The Sound of Music. In this game you play a member of the Von Droog family, or one of their close friends, as they attempt to survive or escape the German occupation of Austria. Each character is desperate to save their Favourite Things - without them life is pretty much not worth going on with and escape pointless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opposing the characters is the German army (mostly Evil Nazis with black leather boots, black leather gloves, sneers and loud guns), double-crossing Nazi sympathisers, and slavering, barking dogs. Leading them all is Doctor Von Keeton who has assured the F&amp;uuml;hrer that his new mind-altering Technique will not only pacify the restless population, but build an unstoppable force of brain-washed soldiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
