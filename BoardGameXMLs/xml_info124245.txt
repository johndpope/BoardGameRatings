			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you now possess is a modification of the Risus: the Anything RPG created by S. John Ross. Risus does what it was intended to do swimmingly; however, I have found myself wanting something that allows for a little more generic-ness to the rules that comprise Risus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I enjoy the freeform mayhem of character creation and combat that Risus brings to the table, but wanted to add my own contribution. I wanted something that could be used to provide the oomph to power fantasy super heroes but at the same time have the capability to be scaled back to run a gritty horror campaign. Thus, GENERIKUS was born.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consider this my attempt to grab Risus by the collars, slap it around a bit, get it to stop slouching and stand up straight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
