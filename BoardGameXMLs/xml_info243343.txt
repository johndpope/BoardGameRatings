							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dino Battle</name>
									
			<description>DinoBattle is a card game for 2-5 players, consisting of 45 dino cards, 6 survival cards, and 6 event cards. The dino cards show an image of a dinosaur or a meteorite. At the top of the cards there are one or more small icons of dino&amp;rsquo;s that can be defeated by that dino card. In DinoBattle every player receives four dino cards, and the player whose turn it is has to act on the last played dinosaur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The smallest scavengers are eaten by the medium sized hunters. Medium sized hunters are in turn eaten by the bigger dinos that also eat each other or can be defeated by smaller dinos working together well. Even the biggest dinos are not safe, because the meteorite can be fatal for them and thus mark a new beginning for the scavengers.&lt;br/&gt;After playing a card, the player replenishes his hand, unless the player failed to play a card that fitted the previous dino card. In that case the player plays on with a hand with one card less. The game ends when a player cannot play his last card, and the player with the most cards in hand wins the game. In case of a draw, the winners play a knock out round until one winner is left.&lt;br/&gt;It is also possible to play multiple rounds. In that case, each remaining hand card counts as 1 point, and the game ends when a player has 10 points or more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic game of DinoBattle is already very playable for children from 8 years, but the game contains optional cards that can make the game more challenging and interesting for older players&lt;br/&gt;and veterans.&lt;br/&gt;The survival cards offer each player a second chance and give players the possibility to survive for longer in though situations. There are three different survival cards, each with two different options that can offer salvation.&lt;br/&gt;Event cards add new tactical elements and offer players the possibility to achieve a unique advantage over the other players. These cards are face up on the table, visible for all players. Each player can use one event card during his turn. Used event cards are no longer available for other players. Which event card can be played depends on the dino card that is on top of the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;When these optional cards are used, it is no longer possible to play another card than the askes card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you cannot play a matching card, you are out of the game for this round. The last remaining player wins the round, and the player who wins the most rounds, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
