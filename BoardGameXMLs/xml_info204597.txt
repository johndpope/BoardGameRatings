							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MERCS 2.0</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the second edition of the very popular tabletop miniatures skirmish game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MERCS is designed with the idea that a miniatures combat game should look and feel, on a table, like real combat. It is logical in its associations and what it chooses to make important in terms of combat. It places a premium on good, sound tactics. This is not a game where players sit back and shoot at each other from across the table top. Victory has everything to do with the choices you make on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn to think tactically. Suppress and move. Maintain squad discipline, but control the table. Create firing lanes and punish those who move through it. Combat begins and ends with movement. Everyone can shoot; survivors know when to shoot and when to relocate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each MegaCon plays extremely different, having intrinsic strengths and weaknesses. Learn them, then create tactics and adapt in the flow of battle to take advantage of the MegaCon you play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you learn to marry solid tactics with MegaCon strengths, then perhaps you can call yourself a MERCS player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MERCS 2.0 streamlines many of the dice and modifier interactions that exist in the game. It introduces new reference cards, keywords, initiative, and medium range. It also reimagines flank, melee combat, suppression and overwatch, and dealing with elevation in combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version contains all 12 MegaCons, 9 different game modes, and an ever-changing campaign that uses the MERCS: Conflict. custom dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
