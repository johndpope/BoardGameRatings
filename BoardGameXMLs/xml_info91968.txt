							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Advanced Class: Gentleman Scientist</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From reanimating corpses to invisible men, the Gentleman Scientist is a staple of the Victorian literary genre. These reclusive inventors work tirelessly in their laboratories to unlock secrets of science that humanity has yet to discover and make practical applications with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the inventions of literary Gentleman Scientistsare ostensibly rooted in scientific principles, in truth they are often just as mysterious and unexplainable as the magical arts. For example, the process that transformed Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde is explained as an exotic drug, but in truth it is a magical potion. With that in mind, the marvellous inventions of the Gentleman Scientist advanced class are derived from the F/X abilities found in the core book. This serves two goals. First, it provides a ready reference and inspiration for new inventions. Second, it allows the Game Master to introduce F/X abilities into a campaign without including magic or psionics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
