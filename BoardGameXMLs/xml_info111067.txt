							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">One Minute to Midnight</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1947, the &amp;ldquo;Doomsday Clock&amp;rdquo; debuted on the cover of The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Set at seven minutes to midnight, the clock would track the likelihood of a nuclear exchange. Quickly, the clock became a symbol of the nuclear age: a bogeyman for the modern man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1949, the hands of the clock moved for the first time as the Soviet Union tested their first nuclear weapon. Three minutes to midnight. Four years later, as the Soviet Union and the United States each developed the thermonuclear bomb, the clock moved again. 1953 had arrived, and it was two minutes to midnight. Since then, the &amp;quot;Doomsday Clock&amp;quot; has never come closer to midnight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A madman&amp;rsquo;s plot threatens to plunge the world into a nuclear exchange, and only you can foil his scheme. In this serial taking the agents from a nuclear missile silo in the American Midwest to a hidden stronghold on a secret island in the Bermuda Triangle, a former American intelligence agent plots to spark one last battle with his old enemy, the Great Bear Russia. And he&amp;rsquo;ll force the United States to fight on his behalf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is one minute to midnight. Can you stop the clock?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
