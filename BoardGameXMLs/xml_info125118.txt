							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Abandoned Mine</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite all the changes going on this week everything you love about Toys for the Sandbox is still there. We have the all the people and all the possibilities and added more flavour text then before, we also throw in a few magic items because hey who does not like magic items. I would have them looked at before you use them though they may be cursed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This week we delve into an abandoned mine that used to be owned by a pair of second generation adventurers. We have awakened evil, strange singing, blood cults, and more precious stones then you will know what to do with. Come to the Abandoned Mines for the treasure, stay for the Dragon God.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
