			<description>PUCK! is the ultimate test of your trick shot skills in an all-out puck slamming, cup stacking melee! Race to eliminate your opponents&amp;rsquo; cups by landing wooden discs into them, before they land one in yours! Work your way up to the coveted PUCK! For added difficulty, see if you have what it takes to compete at the grandmaster level! This high-stakes game hones your hand-eye coordination and mental agility while testing your focus (and possibly friendships) as you race to win. On your mark, get set, PUCK!&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;from the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PUCK! is a fast and rowdy action/dexterity game where you bounce wooden pucks (discs) off the table and race to land them in small plastic cups also on the table. After you successfully land a puck in a cup, you stack an empty cup on top of it making your next target more difficult to hit as well as bringing the game closer to an end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PUCK! has several different game modes including head-to-head, free-for-all, and team play and is either turn-based or real-time. Each mode has different cup layouts and end-game conditions, but all utilize the same simple and fun operation of bouncing pucks and stacking cups. PUCK! comes with 40 wooden pucks and 11 plastic cups. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
