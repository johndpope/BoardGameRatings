			<description>The game consists of 4 suction-cups-on-a-stick (German: poempel), 5 cardboard chits with 5 different faces, 25 cards representing the 5 different faces (5 each), and 13 pieces sponges (wooden blocks).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player get a 'poempel', the cards are shuffled and divided among all players. The chits are laid out visibly in the middle of the board and the sponges are set aside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using only one hand all players start revealing cards from their stack simultaneously. If two or more players reveal the same face they try to grab their poempel and 'suck-up' the right cardboard chit.&lt;br/&gt;The one to get the chit first, earns one sponge. The game then resumes. If you grab a chit erroneously you have to give back a sponge. The game ends when all sponges are distributed. The player with the most sponges wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
