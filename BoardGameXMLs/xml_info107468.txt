			<description>Players have two counters which move clockwise round a board by the throw of two d6 and both start on their particular colour starting spaces. Each player starts with two counters, 10 chips, 3 strategy cards and a small number of Colour Space cards.&lt;br/&gt; You gain one chip each time one of your counters passes your home base. If a player's counter lands on another player's base they must pay them 2 chips. If you land on a trade space you may buy another strategy card for 5 chips. There are a number of special squares round the board, which if you land on them and hold the right strategy cards, you may attack other player's counters if they are on vulnerable squares. In successful attacks you may win counters, Colour Space cards or chips, depending on the sort of attack. Colour Space cards that are won are placed on the board and may augment your earnings.&lt;br/&gt; The winner is the player who ends up with most counters but the game end condition is not specified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
