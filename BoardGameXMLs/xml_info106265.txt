You can view them during and after the game on your screen or keep permanent records using the printer option.&lt;br/&gt;     Your brilliant play re-enacted by all 22 players on the screen.&lt;br/&gt;     Three modes of play: head-to-head, solitaire, and autoplay.&lt;br/&gt;     Season disks (where you can recreate an entire season) are available separately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the Avalon Hill board game Football Strategy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
