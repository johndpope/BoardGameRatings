			<description>The Holy Scriptures are written inside the cards with numbers. The Bible Knows cards are in order from Double 7 to Double 0.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 8 sets in the deck of 36 cards. The Double sets have &amp;quot;Bonus&amp;quot; points. When a player scores with a double, and connects the numbers, the player gets the regular points plus the bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play 150 to 1,000 points. Each player is dealt 7 cards. Whoever has the Double 7 plays first, or, if a double 5 is played first, player receives points plus bonus. The highest double goes first. If a player scores with a double you get the points plus the bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players must quote the scripture out loud before connecting the numbers. The first player to run out of cards must say, &amp;quot;Bible Knows&amp;quot;. The one who wins the hand receives all points in the other players hand except the bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
