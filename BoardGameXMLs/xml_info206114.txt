			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Truckin': There's always war somewhere, and there's always First World nations lining up to sell arms to one side or the other. Or both. However, certain nations can't be &amp;ldquo;seen&amp;rdquo; to be trading with the aggressive, despotic, belligerent, and mass-grave-producing country of Pinquay. Which is why mercenary companies get hired to make the deliveries. The thing is, the corporation acting as go-between has already been paid, and the First-World government supplying the weapons has already been paid. So, it's only the merc company who hasn't been paid. If something goes wrong, they're the only ones who are out-of-luck. ...But, such is the life of a merc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
