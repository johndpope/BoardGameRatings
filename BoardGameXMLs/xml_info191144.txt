			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 2nd level Encounter for Gangbusters RPG&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don Cole had been working this case for three weeks, and now he just wanted to be off of it. His feet hurt and he needed a drink. He liked the job and he was good at it. There were times, however, when he didn't enjoy the things he had to do.  This looked to be one of those times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all this time he had found the kidnappers, Holed up in a house at the edge of town. He stopped to call for help and moved in to keep an eye on them.  He could make out three of them sitting calm as you please on a car that had more holes in it than a piece of swiss cheese.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He pulled out his trusty .38, but on one side of the house stood a Tough with a tommy gun and on the other a pretty girl with a derringer in her hand. Using the trees for cover, he got as close as he dared and called to them to drop their weapons. This was going to be one of those days . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
