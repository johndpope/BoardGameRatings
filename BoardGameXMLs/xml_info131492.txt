			<description>Designer Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Face of Angels is a fiction game. In it, you'll get to play characters in a story about inhuman powers and human relationships. That sounds all high-brow and literary, but it's not so much. It's more like a cross between superhero comics and teen drama movies.&lt;br/&gt; Everyone playing will tell the story. The story that will be told, though, already has a structure; there is a fixed beginning, a structure for the climax, and guidelines for the end. In addition to that structure, there's a card game that will be played whenever anyone wants their character to do something that would be more fun if the results were uncertain. Because of the structure and the uncertainty, this isn't just sitting around making up a story with friends. This is as fun as storytelling, with all the excitement and suspense of watching a good movie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
