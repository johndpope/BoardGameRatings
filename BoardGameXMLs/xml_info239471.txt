							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Broken Axles</name>
									
			<description>Broken Axles is a 15mm vehicle combat game set in a retro sci-fi, post apocalyptic world. Warbands of raiders roam the Endless Desert, vying with each other for dominance over vital supplies of Crude Oil and refined Cruel with which to sustain their ever-thirsty warmachines. Such prizes are no easy prey, however, as often times these resources are carried in the armoured bellies of massive Battle Rigs, bristling with weaponry and surrounded by escort vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are fast and bloody, where every dice roll can range from triumphant execution to disastrous mishap, conveying the nature of the ramshackle vehicles each player utilizes. Crush your opponents with bouts of metal-crunching road rage, explosive Boomsticks and potent mounted weapons, or die trying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
