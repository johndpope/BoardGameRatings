			<description>An abstract two-player strategy game, CENTRE (formally SPOOLS) has only a few basic rules of play that combine neatly with the unique design of the board to produce a new and different game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By positioning and relocating pieces, players attempt to maneuver their own Emperor to the center circle of the board -- aided by their four Defenders and four Marauders, each of which possesses specific movement and attack capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another unique aspect of the game is the one-way interaction between pieces: Defenders may attack only Marauders, Marauders may attack only Emperors, and Emperors may attack only Defenders and Marauders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
