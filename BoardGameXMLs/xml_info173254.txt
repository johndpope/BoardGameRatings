			<description>Hold my hand is a party card game for 4-8 players. Players are children lost in fairy forest, trying to get out without becoming fairies. Children are scared, and unaware that one of them might be a fairy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played drafting cards. In each turn players look at the cards in their hands, put one card either in front of themselves(1) or in between themselves and player next to them(2 or 3).  (look at the picture).  These cards are put face down.&lt;br/&gt;Then pass rest of the cards to the left.&lt;br/&gt;Then players decide which card that is in between will they look at...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have the game and the rules in the files section, so just take a look ;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
