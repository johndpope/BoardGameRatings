							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Transports</name>
									
			<description>The gameboard shows 3 islands, 6 ships and two opposing fortified harbours with their areas marked off with blacklines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was published shortly before the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. It requires the Red Fleet to move its transports from one safe harbour to another while under the protection of battleships, destroyers and cruisers. Its enemy, the Black Fleet, attempts to capture the red side's transports. Rules govern the movement of each vessel, and there are a number of islands that have to be avoided. The Black Fleet is not allowed to enter the harbours. The game is won or lost if the transports are successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment: 13 triangular cards each with a picture of a ship and a letter, these represents two fleets (red and black) and various ships: transports, battleships, destroyers and cruisers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in London.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
