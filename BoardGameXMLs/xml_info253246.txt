							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sorrow of the Sand Lord</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wanderers emerge out of the desert in the dead of night, bending low against the driving sandstorm. They are adventurers, heroes whose tale has yet to begin. And they are in trouble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the last three days, a raging sandstorm has harried you. Your faces and hands are rubbed raw by the driving sand. Worse, not once has the sun risen in that time: 3 days worth of unbroken night. Finally, something rises out of the yellow-black haze. A massive structure, outlined in moonlight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heroes are TRAPPED in a cursed land, harried by sandstorms. They stumble upon a ruined city and a DARK TOMB that lies beneath. Can they find a way to escape this land? Or are they doomed to be drowned in the SORROW OF THE SAND LORD?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An intro adventure for level 1 characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
