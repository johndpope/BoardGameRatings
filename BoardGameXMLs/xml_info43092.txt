			<description>A print-and play game for the BGG &amp;quot;Make a Dice Game!&amp;quot; competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is given a set of d6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each face is a picture representing a story element. Each player in turn secretly rolls the dice, then tells a short story which must contain all of the story elements rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other players then secretly vote on which story elements they thought the teller had rolled by selecting them on their dice; they each score points equal to the number of elements they guess correctly, with the teller scoring points equal to the highest guesser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until each player has had a turn; after which, players (in turn order) vote for the best story by placing their dice in front of one or more other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each die scores one point; the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
