			<description>A Compleate Encounter Under the Surface of the Old World&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Johann's story is simple. He is the mayor of Karstenberg, and the sole source of the income for the villagers is a small silver-mine. The yield is meagre, but it is just enough to get by on. However, two men have recently disappeared in the mine. Axel Muller vanished 19 days before the Characters meet Johann, and Kurt Zondervan vanished 8 days ago. They were alone, doing maintenance work, when they vanished. No trace of their bodies has been found, but some of their equipment was recovered, littered over some distance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
