			<description>This game is endorsed by the former world champion John Parrot.&lt;br/&gt;The Game can be played by all ages and you need luck and knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;First of all you set a winning points target or a time limit and then the first player to reach the target or scores the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;To score points you must land on a red block on the Board of which you score as in snooker 1 point, you then spin the dial to see what colour question you must answer (As in snooker you get 2 points for yellow,3 for Green,4 for Brown,5 for Blue,6 for pink and 7 for black) but, depending on the colour, &lt;br/&gt;the questions you must answer get harder).&lt;br/&gt;If you are correct you get another turn if not then it is up to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;John Parrott (1964 - ), pictured on the box. He won the World Snooker Championship in 1991.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
