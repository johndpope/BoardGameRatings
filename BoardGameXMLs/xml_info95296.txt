			<description>Powerplay was published in spielbox 1991 #6.&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 4x4 game board. Each player has 4 round-shaped and 4 square-shaped tokens numbered from 1 to 4. The tokens have two sides, one of them with a black frame. Each player, alternately, should put one of his tokens on a free field on the game board. When all fields are occupied, it's time to check the effects of each token on the opponent's neighboring tokens. The square pieces work horizontally and vertically whereas the round tokens work diagonally. A token is considered conquered, if the score of the pieces surrounding it is higher than its own value, and it is turned onto its black framed side. The winner is the player whit the most points, i. e., a higher difference between the points of the pieces he conquests and the points of your pieces conquered by the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
