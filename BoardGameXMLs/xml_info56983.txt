			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the second major version of the Game Engine Manual. It&amp;iexcl;-s been an interesting road so far Response to the game has been great, much more than I expected. I want to start off by thanking everyone who wrote to me about the game, and thank them again for their kind words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the two years since GEM was first put together, I've been making a number of small and subtle changes. There've been some requests that were put in, and some streamlining of things that were a bit clunky before.  Most of these things were subtle and minor, but they started to build up. After so long, it became obvious that a slight revamp of the&lt;br/&gt;system was needed.&lt;br/&gt;[...]&lt;br/&gt;The Game Engine Manual is, and isn't, a complete role-playing game. In this book are the basic rules for a role-playing system, including character generation, training, combat, and improving characters. Don't worry if these terms aren't familiar they soon will be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
