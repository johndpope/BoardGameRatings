			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KLP-2 is back! This smart little droid has teleported into one of the satellites in an attempt to shut down the reactors which power the massive destructor beam weapons of the planet Quartech and which are now trained on Earth. &lt;br/&gt;With his improved grappling system, KLP-2 must&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     battle with enemy droids&lt;br/&gt;     try to crack the logic sequences of hostile inhabitants&lt;br/&gt;     utilise spare parts to re-build clones of himself&lt;br/&gt;     improve his weaponry and systems&lt;br/&gt;     recharge his power cells&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If any droid can do it, KLP-2 can!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a follow-up in concept to Quazatron which in turn lends some ideas from Paradroid. However, the game has improved over those in a number of points. View is 3D god mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
