			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you remember the scandal when Congress members had huge overdrafts in their checking accounts and were not paying it back?  Well this game lets you do it, too!  The goal of the game is to overdraw your checking amount by more than your opponent(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set up the game by placing the numbered cards in 11 face down stacks according to the numbers printed on them (2-12).  The numbers corresponds to the following political job titles: 2 Vice President, 3  President for a Day, 4  Retiring Politician, 5  Cabinet Member, 6  Incumbent Politician, 7  House of Representatives, 8  Politician's Aid, 9  Diplomat, 10  Senator, 11  Political Appointee, and 12 White House Chief of Staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During their turn, players roll the dice and take a card matching the number.  The cards instruct the player to record a debit (subtraction) or a credit (addition) in their check register.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has a full check register page - 20 items.  The winner with the highest overdraft wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
