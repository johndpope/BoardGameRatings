			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An action game in which you dogfight unending streams of enemy aircraft for a set time limit of four minutes or less.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on fighter combat during the Arab-Israeli Wars (1948 to 1982 in the game). Unlike the earlier Strike Fighters Android, which solely featured jet aircraft, you start this game with three propeller driven piston engine fighters. The 1948 aircraft are an unlocked Israeli Spitfire Mk.IX, a locked Egyptian Spitfire and a locked Israeli P-51D Mustang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with the prior game in the Strike Fighters series, the capabilities of your aircraft will improve as you progress through the Israel 1948-82 campaign. Starting with aircraft armed with guns, you will soon transition to jets equipped with early (and unreliable) heat seeking air-to-air missiles. That is followed by the addition of radar guided missiles, and later defensive countermeasures. In addition, during the 1960s, some jets are only armed with a small number of missiles and no gun. This accurately reflects the time period during which some &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot; theorized that the combination of high speeds and guided missiles would negate the need for guns and dogfighting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every time you kill 5 planes, time advances 1 year and you get keys to unlock one or more new planes which may offer more advanced technology, longer play times or different weapons loadouts. Strike Fighters Israel also provides additional unlock keys in the years 1956, 1967, 1973, and 1982. While you can purchase more modern aircraft before playing through to the year that they are unlocked in the campaign, all planes can be unlocked for free through continued successful play. In addition, missions flown with aircraft that are later than the current campaign year do not count towards your advancement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
