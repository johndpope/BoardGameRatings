			<description>Mowgli is a cooperative tile game based on the characters of the immortal novel The Jungle Book of Rudyard Kipling. It has a cooperative playing mode and a competitive mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes different scenarios, inspired of different episodes of the tale. Every player represents one of the main characters of the tale: Baloo, Bagueraa, Kaa or Akela and will try to help Mowgli to hunt, to escape from the Lost City or to fulfill his destiny, banishing the fearsome Shere Khan from the jungle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on the principles of the tile games. We will create a template of tiles on the table, which simulate to be the jungle. The players will move their animals by turns, trying to avoid the dangers of the wilderness, to obtain enough food or to move Mowgli to a safe location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But every turn Shere Khan will be stalking and getting closer to his prey, Mowgli.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
