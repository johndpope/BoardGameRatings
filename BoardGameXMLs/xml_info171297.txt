							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brood of the Spider Queen: Spider Bloodlines</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, What Tangled Webs You&amp;rsquo;ll Weave!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spiders have an ancient and primordial hold on the human mind. These tiny, often harmless creatures are nonetheless incredibly frightening to many, and are at least vaguely unsettling and alien to most. It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise, then, that spiders have a long and storied tradition in fantasy media and roleplaying games, including an entire race of elves whose entire lives seem to revolve around arachnids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents two spider-themed bloodlines, one for bloodragers, introduced in the Advanced Class Guide, and one for sorcerers. Each of these bloodlines grants access to a variety of iconic spidery powers, including poison, draining blood from victims, climbing walls, and, of course, numerous ways to use sticky, silky webs. Sorcerers with the spider bloodline focus more on controlling and manipulating their victims, and while bloodragers can also impede their foes, they focus more heavily on using their arachnid heritage to empower their own abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
