							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Diamond in the Rough: The Battle for Fort Driant, October 1944</name>
									
			<description>The Battle for Fort Driant marked the end of Patton&amp;rsquo;s campaign in the Lorraine. Following the breakout of the US Third Army from Normandy and its drive across France, Patton&amp;rsquo;s forces had fought hard and victoriously. However, by the end of September shortages of fuel and ammunition forced General Dwight D. Eisenhower to order a halt. Those supplies that did get through were diverted to British General Bernard Montgomery&amp;rsquo;s forces to the north for the upcoming Market-Garden offensive. Frustrated, Patton ordered a &amp;ldquo;reconnaissance in force&amp;rdquo; to take Fort Driant, the last German-held position barring Third Army&amp;rsquo;s way to Metz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Believing the fortress to be held only by rear echelon personnel and demoralized remnants of units that had retreated into its works, Patton felt the position could be easily taken by a reinforced battalion of the 11th Regiment of the 5th US Infantry Division (nicknamed the &amp;ldquo;Red Diamonds&amp;rdquo;), the only unit he could provide sufficient fuel and ammo to continue offensive operations. However, the German garrison was well prepared to resist, with elements of the 17th SS (Kiss My Ass) division nearby for support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In actuality the US forces attacking Fort Driant would be outnumbered and outgunned. The ten day battle that raged at Fort Driant was marked by bloody and fierce fighting that at times was waged hand-to-hand and both sides calling in &amp;ldquo;final protective fire&amp;rdquo; upon their own positions. In the end the 5th Infantry&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;blood and guts&amp;rdquo; would not be enough, and Patton would order his only retreat of the war from Fort Driant. Can you do better?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
