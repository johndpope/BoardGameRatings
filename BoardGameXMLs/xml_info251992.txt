			<description>Where's Baby Jesus? is a simple children's game where players spin the spinner and move the indicated number of spaces. When they land on a space that shows a picture with a missing object, they can then immediately move to the space that shows that missing object. The first player to reach the final space on the board wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As described on the back of the board, this game is supposed to stimulate conversation with children about the birth of Jesus, as depicted in Luke 2 and Matthew 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summmary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
