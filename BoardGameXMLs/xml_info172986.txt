							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Medieval Watchtower</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a One Page, 4 level, full color battlemap of a Medieval Watchtower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps (VTT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;You must sneak up to the watchtower under the cover of darkness and deal swift blows to its guards so that they cannot warn the keep of our impending attack. Do this quietly and quickly to receive your gold, mercenaries.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medieval Watchtower is a small four page map of a tower with four levels depicting the grounds outside and the tower interior. This tower can support up to four watchmen inside comfortably.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medieval Watchtower is intended for fantasy or medieval era historical games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map and possibly our Western Keep map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Clock Strikes Midnight: The group is hired to waylay the four soldiers in the medieval watchtower before an invasion of the nearby keep. With the medieval watchtower captured, the invading army hopes to catch the keep with its guard down for an easy night ambush. The group must capture or kill the four soldiers and prevent them from warning the castle. The group must then escape the watchtower and meet up with their employer leading them to the keep as their employer is leading the force assaulting the castle. If they succeeded in time, their employer pays them in the courtyard and asks them to help in the final assault against the inner keep for more pay. If they did not succeed in time, he refuses to pay them on the outskirts of the keep and bids them adieu as he reconsiders his attack after losing the element of surprise and meeting stiff resistance. This may anger the group. They might attack their former employer or even attempt to convince the besieged castle defenders to allow them to switch sides and join in the defense of the keep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A reverse of this scenario could be the group is hired as night watchmen to protect the keep when the enemy sends assassins to kill them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
