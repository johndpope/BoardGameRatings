							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fiasco in New Crobuzon</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secret lovers make out furtively in the shadow of The Ribs, while sordid drug deals that could bring the City to its knees take place in the hovel behind them.  A bitter-faced cactacae cocks his rivebow in a back alley before rampaging against the militiamen who killed his comrade in cold blood.  That smell emanating from Salacus Fields has been there a week, and rumors have begun to spread about its terrifying origin.  Better find a way to keep your head down, though that only works so long...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
