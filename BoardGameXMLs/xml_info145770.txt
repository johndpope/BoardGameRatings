							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wayward Manor</name>
									
			<description>There&amp;rsquo;s something to be said for shrouding endeavors in mystery, but some of you might desire proper context for what you&amp;rsquo;re looking at. Based on an original tale by Neil Gaiman, Wayward Manor is a new game for PC, Mac and tablets, due to be released Fall 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in a 1920s Victorian Gothic pastoral estate, Wayward Manor focuses on the plight of a ghost whose hope of a peaceful after-life is interrupted by a remarkable cast of intruders. Awoken from his post-mortem slumbers, our ghost must find ever-more inventive and brilliant ways to scare them away. As the ghost learns more about the living characters, he also learns more about his own death and after-life, and the danger they are all facing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
