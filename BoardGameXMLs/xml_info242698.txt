			<description>Brace for Impact! The raging war between the Antillians and the Morkolytes has reached its highest peak.  In a final ferocious siege, the rival aliens battle for control of the star system.  Each species gathers their forces, planet by planet, as tensions grow. In the end, command of the star system can fall under only one dominion, but whose?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stellar Siege is a 2-player tactical card game in which you play as one of the rival alien species.  You will deploy aliens from your hand into your siege forces at each planet.  Hand management is the key to victory, because the number of cards in your hand dictates to which planet you will deploy your alien that turn.  Outnumbering your opponent at a planet means you conquer it.  At the end of the game, the player who has conquered the most planets wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
