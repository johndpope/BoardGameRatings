			<description>In 楽園の方舟 (&amp;quot;Ark of Paradise&amp;quot;), players are escaping a sinking island, and compete to collect the most resources before the end of the sixth round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players place two workers each round, one at the lowest numbered position of a line of their choice, then one at the highest numbered position of a line of their choice, which are then moved in order to the available resource spots for that line. Points are scored for resources and majority of resources, for contributing to the arks that take them off the island, and for completing a secret goal by the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
