			<description>You are a guild leader in the hottest new massively multiplayer online role-playing game: Dimensions of Discord Online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since you're just starting out, you will recruit players to your guild as you earn reputation, then send those players to slay monstrous foes in the world, clear perilous raids, and compete with each other in a PvP format &amp;mdash; all to earn that sweet, sweet loot and reputation. Each turn, you can choose to recruit players to your guild, purchase items from the auction house, challenge a raid, hunt a monstrous foe, participate in a PvP contest, or upgrade your guild hall. Your players are online only during certain times of day, and you have to balance when and how to use them together!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raids include a press-your-luck element in which you have the chance to accrue a large amount of loot, reputation, and potentially, equipment, but only if you exit the raid before your party wipes! Monstrous foes are singular fights against powerful enemies that appear randomly. PvP allows you to wager on 2-on-2 battles between your guild members, and upgrading your guild hall provides various bonuses, not the least of which is increasing your maximum number of guild members!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after a certain number of turns. Can you accrue the most reputation to become the best guild on your server?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
