							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dominant Clan</name>
									
			<description>The objective of Dominant Clan is to be part of the largest clan with the highest rank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses Action cards in manipulating the gameplay. Some action cards allow players to swap identities, stumble players, nullify effects and even changing the scenario of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each game which is the revealing phase, each player is dealt with 3 Item cards which work as identities. Similar matched identities creates clan which introduce the leader system. Dominant leaders have higher abilities than any player in the game where they have the ability to use their member's cards which is the key to securing the outcasts. Ranks of each player plays the role of power and defence. Ranks are given to those who are worthy of becoming a leader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game there is the Item Deck and the Action Deck. When the game starts, each player is given a choice to choose either drawing an Item card or an Action card. Then the player can either keep those cards or use the Action cards. For every player can only hold up to 3 cards in-hand, it forces players to a good challenge of planning and execution among members. This also leads to multiple strategic ways of winning the game. Backstabbing betrays can happen and so does denouncing friendships for a game! As much as sabotaging is a prominent factor of the game, it is also a heavy cooperative game that fosters communication among players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a number of clan members is reached, the game ends with a rank comparison with the outcasts and the dominant leader. The highest rank holder wins the game. With a draw as a result, the dominant team takes the victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dominant Clan is currently in the process of publishing and is estimated to be released in late 2015.&lt;br/&gt;One of the first modern European card games designed by a Malaysian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
