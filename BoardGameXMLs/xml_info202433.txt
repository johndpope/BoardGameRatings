							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Security Theater</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You had six weeks to plan, prepare, and execute the biggest caper of your career. You were up against one of the most technologically advanced security systems ever built. It was called Security Theater, named after the company who built it, and the play on words was intentional. Security Theater wanted to lull potential thieves into believing the company was just for show, and that reputation seemed to bear itself out. There were few, if any, reports of successful arrests. Indeed, the rumors among the larceny community indicated that collections protected by Security Theater were easy marks. But that was just as the company intended&amp;mdash;in every previous attempt, the thieves involved actually died or were severely maimed in the process, but Security Theater somehow managed to keep the violence out of the press.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
