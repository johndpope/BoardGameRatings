							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Burntime</name>
									
			<description>Burntime is a strategy/RPG game for DOS and Amiga produced by Max Design  in 1993. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic future, based on the three stages of every civilized society &amp;ndash; its ascent, heyday and downfall. Burntime starts at the end of a flourishing civilization. The main goal of the game is to conquer the remaining habitable areas, as well as to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To progress through this game the player must establish sources of food and water. The player must then clear out hostiles and hire mercenaries to guard the location. Armor can be found in the form of protective suits, and all elements of a suit must be collected for full protection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three classes of mercenaries: doctors, technicians, and fighters. Fighters are good at defending areas and killing monsters. Technicians are needed to combine scrap items to produce working items (for example, wire, plus screws, plus a woodpile will produce a rat trap, a great source of food and income). Finally, doctors will heal you and your men if you keep them with you over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Burntime , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
