							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Princess Maker: Legend of Another World</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Princess Maker: Legend of Another World is a game that is similar in many aspects to Princess Maker 2, however it has drastically different adventuring and combat modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the rest of the Princess Maker Series, you are responsible for raising a girl until she is old enough to make her own life.  You decide what she studies, where she travels, and how she makes money.  Each of these tasks alters her stats, usually raising some and lowering others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game depending on what experiences she has had, you'll receive one of many different endings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
