			<description>The Finders Keepers game from Schaper is described as a grade school game for two or more players.&lt;br/&gt;Pick a card then hit the switch which releases the ball and the objects. Pick the object that was on the card before the ball hits the bottom of the ramp and locks the objects back into place, keep what objects you retreive. &lt;br/&gt;There are two sets of objects and two sets of cards, one simple with recognizable shapes, the other much harder with abstract shapes.&lt;br/&gt;If the game gets too easy you can put the ball at the lower peg which gives you even less time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
