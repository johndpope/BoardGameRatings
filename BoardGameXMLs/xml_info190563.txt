							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Order of Invention</name>
									
			<description>A deck of Invention cards have a picture and the name of the invention on one side and the year it was invented on the other. Four Invention cards are placed on the table with the year face down. Each player has four player chips with first, second, third and fourth in them. Players place their chips face down next to the Invention cards to indicate the order they think those 4 cards were invented. For each chip placed next to the correct invention card, players receive a point. These points can be wagered in future rounds. Whoever has the highest score after 5 rounds, wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Invention Deck has one Invention per year with no duplicate years. They include a wide variety of inventions in consecutive years spanning from the late 1890's to the 1970's. Inventions are easily recognizable but just obscure enough that each game will be a challenge!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
