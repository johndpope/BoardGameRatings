			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A well known trail winds its way through the highlands near the Gorgoth Mountains. Travellers along this well known trail have recently reported being accosted by a trio of very large ogres, large creatures known for their cruel torture they inflict upon their prey before eating them. The guilds in the town of Fjinfjord are looking for a few adventurers to travel along the trail and remove the problem. The sizable sum of four hundred gold pieces are offered to those willing to brave the danger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed or use with all old school styled games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
