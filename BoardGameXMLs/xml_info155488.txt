			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ninth volume in our Mythic Monsters series, Mythic Monsters: Undead brings you a dozen and TWO deathless and deadly monsters come back from beyond the grave, their eternal rest shattered by the weight of their sin or the burden of their curse. Here you will find undead that hunger for flesh like ghouls and ghasts, to those that hunger for the life force of their victims, like wights and spectres. Such commonplace and familiar undead take on an entirely new and terrifying texture in the hands of the Legendary team, and so do more exotic undead like the soul-craving devourer and demilich , the devastating witchfire, and the headless horsemen of the graveyard, the dullahan, along with the brand-new jigsaw man that is forever coming apart at the seams and wants you to join him in a dismembered demise. As if these mythic undead were not enough, Mythic Monsters: Undead also delves into the secrets of mythic necromancy, dealing with the corpse-flesh of the dead and undead alike. The 14 undead contained herein, ranging in CR from 3 to 17, are updated for the mythic rules, and when we say updated we mean complete stat blocks, yes, but more than that every one of these walking dead and restless spirits has its own unique and exciting new mythic abilities, from a mythic totenmaske's fleshdrink and insufferable ennui to the devour spell and obliterating wail of a mythic demilich!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
