							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Unquenchable Will of Wolves Encounter Book 1</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players entering the North via the Will of Wolves campaign will need people &amp;amp; creatures to interact with &amp;ndash; that&amp;rsquo;s what this book does. Because the campaign setting itself is rather big the sections have been broken up into more digestible pieces and these run more or less from the southernmost edge of the map to the northernmost edge of the campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book &amp;amp; the accompanying adventures are presented to get players started in the setting.  It includes all of the monsters &amp;amp; NPCs mentioned in the text of Adventure 51.51-A &amp;ndash; Unquenchable Will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It also stands on its own somewhat, as a resource for creating encounters &amp;amp; as a list for monsters.  Some parts of this book require a few resources from the main Game of the North manual &amp;ndash; the conditions tables, the treasure generation rules &amp;amp; so on &amp;ndash; though certainly an inventive Referee will be able to easily make up their own rules on these subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entries for monsters &amp;amp; for NPCs are, it is hoped, easy enough to understand and close enough to system agnostic so as to be useful to a Referee running any sort of system, although the creatures themselves are better served in a tropical &amp;amp; coastal environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
