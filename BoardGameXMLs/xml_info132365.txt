			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A small river meanders leisurely through the forest, its bottom covered with sand and rocks it carried along for many miles. Although the river is not very deep it is in most places too deep to allow easy crossing, especially with wagons. At this out of the way place though it widens slightly and its flow slows even more. Enough so, to deposit more sand at the rocks covering much of its ground. Thus a ford developed over the years. Still travellers crossing the river with their wagons should take care not to break a wheel or an axle. And although using this ford instead of a bridge further down stream might save some tolls and fees travelling through the forest is not without risks either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
