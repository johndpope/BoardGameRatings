			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;50 years ago the classic holiday film Santa Claus Conquers the Martians premiered on the big screen! In an alternate universe somewhere, it was wildly successful and spun off into a television series the following year. It took its place among other popular and beloved shows of the day that combined fantasy, reality, and campy theatrics. Shows  like My Favorite Martian, Bewitched, I Dream of Jeannie, Batman, Lost in Space, The Addams Family, and The Munsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This roleplaying game is based on the expanded universe of that television series! Powered by the Fate Accelerated Edition rules, you can play a human, an elf, a Martian, a robot, or even Santa Claus himself! Battle the forces of Voldar's rebellion! Opposes the secret agents of NYET, who think Santa has the key to winning the Space Race! Spread joy and good cheer to all of the good girls and boys, on Earth and Mars!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains the setting, the complete rules including character creation and gamemaster advice, pregenerated characters for players and a supporting cast, villains, equiment, and a starting adventure based on the television series pilot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
