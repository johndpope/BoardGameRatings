			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2461, mankind has expanded beyond Earth and colonized Venus, Mars and Titan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For over 200 years, all communication and commerce between our four worlds has been conducted through the SysNet, a completely secure information and communication network.  That is until yesterday&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our sun erupted into activity, volatile solar storms raged across our star&amp;rsquo;s surface while massive solar flares bombard our system, causing havoc with our technologies and knocking down the security protocols of the SysNet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the SysNet&amp;rsquo;s defenses down,hackers and government agencies  alike descend upon the vulnerable data files like Locusts, stealing everything they can before the security protocols engage and once again locks the system down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is yours for the taking&amp;hellip; Zero Day War has begun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zero Day War is a 2-4 player card game. Players take the roles of hackers from different planets who are taking advantage of a security malfunction in the SysNet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use Exploit cards to program future actions and Hack files.  A unique count down mechanic is used to activate all the programs at once at the end of the round. Players steal files, complete contracts and cause havoc for other players in the game.  The hacker with the most files &amp;amp; contracts filled wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
