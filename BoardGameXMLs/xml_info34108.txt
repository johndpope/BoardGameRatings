			<description>This game is available in English and in French&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A terrific card game involving strategy and the letters of the alphabet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The highest card wins the hand, but watch out for the wild card that can play tricks on you. The player with the most hands wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the game: &lt;br/&gt;The players choose at random who deals first. This player deals the cards based on the number of players and places the deck of remaining cards face down on the table. The player cuts the deck to determine the trump colour which is the highest ranking suit. The player then places the trump reminder card face up on the table for all to see. The player to the dealer&amp;rsquo;s left goes first. The first player lays one card face up on the table. Each player takes turns playing a card of the same colour as the colour requested. If a player does not have a card of the colour requested, he or she may play a trump colour, a card of a different colour or a Lettro TM card. The player with the highest card wins the hand. Then the winner of the hand plays the first card, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If more than one Lettro card is played in a round, the last player to play a Lettro card wins the hand. When a player plays a Lettro card, he or she can change the trump immediately, but players who have not yet completed&lt;br/&gt;the round must play cards of the colour originally requested. After all the cards have been played, enter each player&amp;rsquo;s number of hands won. Then change dealers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: &lt;br/&gt;26 red cards from A to Z, 26 blue cards from A to Z, 26 yellow cards from A to Z, 26 green cards from A to Z, 4 Lettro cards, 2 trump, reminder cards, Game rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
