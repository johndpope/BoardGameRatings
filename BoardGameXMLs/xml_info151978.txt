			<description>In Ampel (German for &amp;quot;traffic signal&amp;quot;), two players compete to make as many &amp;quot;traffic signals&amp;quot; as possible.  A traffic signal is three consecutive discs in a line, in the formation red-yellow-green.  The catch is that one player plays red, and the other plays green; the yellow discs are neutral, and never move &amp;mdash; other than being removed upon formation of a traffic signal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you must perform the following three steps in order:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Move one of your discs.&lt;br/&gt;     Move one of your opponent's discs (except the one she just put into play).&lt;br/&gt;     Add one of your discs, but not in such a way as to directly create any traffic signals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The movement rules on the triangular grid are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The disc moves in a straight line along the lines of the grid.&lt;br/&gt;     The number of spaces it moves is equal to the total number of discs in that line.&lt;br/&gt;     Each time the disc reaches an obstruction, it must change direction, as you wish (but not 180&amp;deg;).&lt;br/&gt;     It must be able to move its full movement, or it can't be move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time a player forms a traffic signal, she removes the discs from the board, keeps the yellow as a prize, and gives the red and green back their respective owners.  As soon as one of the players has captured half or more of the yellow discs, she wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
