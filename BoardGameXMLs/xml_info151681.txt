			<description>From the beginning of the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;THIS is an attempt to devise a game based on the principles of war&amp;mdash;a game, mind you, not a study. There must not be a single umpire about. The rules must cover all questions on what may or may not be done, and decide losses; and yet they must not be too long or too complicated. And the paraphernalia used in the game must be simple.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Simplified Wargame is an operational level wargame with specific historic theme. Published in Field Artillery Journal (Sept.-Oct. 1922), the game is played on a point-to-point map, drawn up at random by the players, representing a road network. Units secretly allocate military units to a number of forces represented by pins on the map. The contents of each force is hidden from the opponent. Turns are plotted and carried out simultaneously with any battles resolved using bidding mechanics. The goal is to capture the enemy capital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
