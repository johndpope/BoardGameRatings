			<description>In this abstract board game, players alternate placing white and black pawns on a 4x4 grid. After each player has placed 7 pawns, a red pawn is placed on one of the two remaining spaces. The players then move their pawns, trying to get four pawns in a row across the board. The first person to get four pawns in a row wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is one of two original board games published as part of a &amp;quot;Free Printable Board Games&amp;quot; article by the Love2Know website in July 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
