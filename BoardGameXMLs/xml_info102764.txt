							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">John Madden Football &#039;93</name>
									
			<description>John Madden Football '93 featured 28 updated teams from the '91-'92 season, as well as 10 new teams: 2 All-Madden teams and 8 Greatest ever teams. The teams featured in the game were represented by city names. There were no player names, logos, or stadium names used, due to those rights being held by the NFL and the NFLPA. John Madden Football '93 was the first in the Madden series to incorporate &amp;quot;split-play calling&amp;quot;, overturning of certain calls by referees, the use of the No-Huddle Offense, and player taunting. The coin toss was finally added in this version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was a &amp;quot;Championship Edition&amp;quot; later released for Genesis, replacing the 1992 season teams with teams taken from the 1966-1991 seasons as well as introducing two &amp;quot;All Madden&amp;quot; teams (one made of players from the 1966-1991 time period and one made of then-current players). It was a rental exclusive game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was also a John Madden Duo CD Football for the TurboGrafx-CD (primarily, the TurboDuo) related to this game, which took features from both the original and the Championship Edition, and featured CD audio (menu music and audience cheering) and video (coin flips, etc) clips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;John Madden Football '93&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
