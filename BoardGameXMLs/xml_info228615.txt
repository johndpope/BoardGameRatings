			<description>TopATop Family is a family party game for 3-6 players, aged 4 and above. The gameplay time depends on the number of players and takes between 15 and 30 minutes. It is a simple and very dynamic game in which you will have a chance to use your dexterity, observation and quickness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, you take turns placing cards in the middle of the table and reacting appropriately to the pictures on the cards played. A player who does that better &amp;mdash; either quicker, more accurately, or without making a mistake &amp;mdash; than others wins that challenge and collects that card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
