							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Griff Oberwald</name>
									
			<description>From Forgeworld's webstore:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Oberwald&amp;rsquo;s qualities are those of the classic Blood Bowl hero. He&amp;rsquo;s tall, superfit and strong, with a grace and co-ordination that can leave most other players standing. Instantly recognisable across a murky Blood Bowl field by the splattering of gore across his kit, Oberwald cuts a very dashing figure and it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise the girls go wild when he has the ball in his capable hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The very peak of square-jawed, sculpted manliness, the world-famous Griff Oberwald and his excellent quiff can be added to any Human Blood Bowl team. He&amp;rsquo;s clad in just enough armour to protect his vitals, while leaving him free to run as quickly as possible, and his sneering face (covered with a helmet or not; your choice) and knuckledusters show he definitely means business on the pitch. Rules for fielding Griff Oberwald are found as a Star Player card in the Blood Bowl boxed games, as well as in Blood Bowl Death Zone Season One.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This resin kit comprises 6 components, and includes 2 32mm round bases, one featuring a hole to slot a ball into, indicating possession of the ball in your games of Blood Bowl.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
