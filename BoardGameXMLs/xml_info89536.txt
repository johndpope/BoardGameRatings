			<description>In Archer Maclean's Mercury, the player tilts a level in order to get a drop of mercury to its appointed destination, in a similar fashion to Marble Madness. Differences include newer obstacles and the ability for the mercury to morph, split and transform around the levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sequel to Mercury has been released, entitled Mercury Meltdown. The game features new puzzles and modes, as well as a more vibrant and cartoony style of graphics. Another sequel was released only for the Wii called Mercury Meltdown Revolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mercury (game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
