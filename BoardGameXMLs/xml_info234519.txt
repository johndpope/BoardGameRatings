							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Crypt of Khaab&#039;r</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Torchbearer adventure for 3-5 players of 1st-3rd levels&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High in the steppes of Barbaria, the epics tell of Khaab&amp;rsquo;r, a brave and fearsome wanderer who rose to become King of his tribe. His dagger, Tiger&amp;rsquo;s Tooth, was his constant companion throughout his legendary exploits. During his daring moonlight raid of High Hollow, it was Tiger&amp;rsquo;s Tooth that silenced the lookouts. When he was captured by the army of Sanction, it was Tiger&amp;rsquo;s Tooth that cut the rope binding his wrists. Throughout the rest of his life, Tiger&amp;rsquo;s Tooth was there, hanging at his hip or gripped in his fist&amp;mdash;a symbol of his strength and cunning. When Khaab&amp;rsquo;r died, Tiger&amp;rsquo;s Tooth was placed in his crypt to serve him in the afterlife.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Centuries have passed. Khaab&amp;rsquo;r&amp;rsquo;s tribe has settled down, building a town on the shores of the great Khor&amp;rsquo;aat lake. Now foreigners arrive daily in Shaa Khor&amp;rsquo;aat&amp;mdash;merchants and mercenaries alike&amp;mdash;seeking their fortunes in this once remote trading post.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ka&amp;rsquo;mara, the elderly King of the Khor&amp;rsquo;aat tribe and descendant of Khaab&amp;rsquo;r himself, has sent out a call to all willing adventurers in the town: retrieve Tiger&amp;rsquo;s Tooth and bring it to him, so that it may aid him as it did his storied ancestor. The locals believe Khaab&amp;rsquo;r&amp;rsquo;s tomb is cursed, and they fear the goblins that reside in the Canyon of Spirits. But outsiders, handy with wit and steel, may be right for the job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
