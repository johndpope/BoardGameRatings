							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle of the Dinosaurs</name>
									
			<description>This is a simple childrens track game with a 3-D cliff inserted into the board. The cliff has 3 ledge spaces. Each player takes a plant-eating dinosaur pawn and places them on the Start space. On a turn, you spin the spinner and advance along the board path to the color indicated. If you land on a space with a bone, you pick it up and save it. If you land on a meat-eating dinosaur space, you may either feed it a bone counter (if you have one) and move ahead 1 space, or else be sent back a number of spaces depending on what type of meat-eater you landed on. The winner is the first player to reach the end of the path on the highest cliff space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
