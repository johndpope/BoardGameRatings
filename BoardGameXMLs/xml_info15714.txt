							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Barbie: Guess the Look!</name>
									
			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Guess your friends new look! Makeovers are hot, and you and your friend just got one! Can you guess what she looks like now? Hmmmm. Maybe she has green eyes ...or red hair ...or maybe she's wearing a hat! The first player to guess the others look wins. Be the first to guess each others new look by asking questions and recreating faces in compact mirrors.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;mirrors&amp;quot; mentioned are actually easels with blank faces on them. The game comes with facial parts (not unlike a police sketch artist kit). So if your friend answers that she has green eyes, you'd place the &amp;quot;green eyes&amp;quot; piece onto the blank face etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
