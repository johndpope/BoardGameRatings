							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Molly&#039;s  Mystery Party Game A Spy on the Home Front</name>
									
			<description>From the box:  Solve a mystery with Molly.  It's Halloween night - but something mysterious has happened to the candy Molly and her friends collected!  Everyone seems to have a motive, so everyone's a suspect.  It's up to you and your friends to find the clues, crack the secret code, and unscramble the mystery!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How the Game Works:  The mystery features characters from the popular Molly stories. The invitations you send out will tell your friends which character they'll play.  On the party day, you and your guests can dress up and &amp;quot;get in character&amp;quot;.  Together, you'll read the script, search for clues - and solve the mystery!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.pleasantcopublications.com/characters/molly/SpyOnTheHomeFront.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.pleasantcopublications.com/characters/molly/SpyOn...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
