			<description>Heart Family trick-taking using double-six dominoes played by 3-4 players. There are eight suits (0-6 and &amp;quot;doubles&amp;quot;) and each domino belongs to two suits. The highest is always the double, followed by high number to low number (for example, the suit of 4s has the order 4-4, 4-6, 4-5, 4-3, 4-2, 4-1, 4-0). The suit of doubles has the order from 6-6 down to 0-0. Leader can decide which suit and other player must follow the suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 11 points in the game. Seven dominoes of the suit of 3s worth 1 point and 0-0 worth 4 points. The goal is to avoid them and keep your score low. There is &amp;quot;shoot the moon&amp;quot; option and you make all other player score 22 points if you are successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
