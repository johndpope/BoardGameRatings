			<description>Metal Slader Glory (メタルスレイダーグローリー?) is a science-fiction-themed graphic adventure game developed by HAL Laboratory that was released for the Family Computer exclusively in Japan on August 30, 1991. It was the final game released by HAL Laboratory as an independent third-party developer before their buy-out by Nintendo. The game's story and character designs were done by manga artist Yoshimiru Hoshi, who loosely based the game on his 1984 manga Ak&amp;ucirc;tens&amp;ocirc; Fixallia​ (亜空転騒フィクサリア, Akūtensō Fikusaria?).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's development took more than four years to complete, with graphics and sounds that pushed the Family Computer's hardware to its limit, requiring the need for an 8-megabit cartridge (the largest for any Family Computer game) and the use of a specialized chip known as the MMC5 to render its graphics. However, by the time the game was released, the Super Famicom was already on the market and sales for the game were not enough to cover its advertising budget, which ended Hal Laboratory's business as an independent game publisher. It has since become a sought-after collector's item in the secondhand market due to its quality and its rarity.[1] The game was remade for the Super Famicom on November 29, 2000 under the title of Metal Slader Glory: Director's Cut, which featured improved graphics and sounds, as well as new scenes. The original Family Computer version was released for the Virtual Console in Japan on December 18, 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Metal Slader Glory&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
