			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It never was the same after the Earl died. The Mansion lay empty and abandoned... except for strange sounds and lights in the night&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Haunted Mansion is a printable dungeon floorplan compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl game. It can be used as a standalone gameboard, or combined with any same-scale tileset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Haunted Mansion is a multiple level set, comprising 4 battlemaps. The main map features a large stone mansion, with dusty and cobwebbed furniture. Stairs lead down to the cellar where a you are as likely to find a coffin as you are barrels.

If you're planning a Halloween or Horror story, your adventurers can see if the stories of a Haunting are true.
