							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Table Top Football</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Although table top football is a game universally played in schools across the land, there has been a distinct lack of uniformity in rule interpretation between districts. Until now. We humbly present the definitive word on the subject, illustrated with a potpourri of wild graphics and packaged with a hand-stitched cowhide finger football.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 30-page booklet with rules for at least three different variants of the old student staple, flicking a miniature football across a table.  The miniature leather football provided is excellent.  (We used to use matchbooks when I was young: open the matchbook and stand it up for field goal attempts.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
