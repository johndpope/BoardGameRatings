							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Money Go Round</name>
									
			<description>Family business game which reuses many of the ideas from Monopoly. The theme is a trip to the fairground, and players travel around a figure of eight shaped track landing on various spaces, which include actions such as finding 10p on a park bench, or missing a bus, as well as the various attractions which can be bought and will then earn admission fees from other players landing on them.  If a set of related stalls are bought then the admission goes up, and advertising chips can be bought to further increase admission costs.  The Fair Manager's Office replaces Jail and so on.  All the money is in small numbers of &amp;pound; and p with realistic card coins and paper notes, making it a useful game to teach children to deal with money too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
