			<description>Subtitle: The Tempted and Ill-Fortuned; a Blackguard for Every Class&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You screwed things up. In fact, you made things worse. You did something so unbelievably bad that you will never, ever, get a chance to try again. It&amp;rsquo;s over. The case is closed on you. You can not retire and train people on the subject, not even simply what they should avoid that you did. People do not want to hear about your good old days before things went wrong. They don&amp;rsquo;t want you around at all. You are a pariah and an outcast, doomed never to walk the path you once trod. You are Fallen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once this ignominious road was thought to be travelled only by the most honourable of people turned bad, the ex-Paladin. That is not the case. In nearly every profession it is possible to fall from grace. Where do you go then? That is what this book is about. For the Paladin there is the path of the blackguard, a road of unthinkable evil and cruelty but there are many other options for those who fall. After the unhappy ending, without thought of redemption, there is still a chance to move forward and find a life of significance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second Look: Fallen introduces 13 new prestige classes in this 31 page book. Many of these prestige classes can be taken by a variety of classes, including paladin. These classes typically start at level 4, instead of level 6. This allows the Player to invest fewer levels in a class they are going to lose in order to take one of these prestige classes. Second Look: Fallen also includes 7 new feats to help the transition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
