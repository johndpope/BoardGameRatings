							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flappy48</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;Flappy48 is a game that combines the concepts of both Flappy Bird and 2048.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flappy48 can be played in a browser (with the Unity web player installed) or downloaded via the Google Play store, and has your little 2 tile leaping between pipes and bumping into other numbers, which will combine if it's a multiple of two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to reach 2048, but the game can be played continuously after.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
