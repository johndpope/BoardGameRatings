							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Secrets of the Taskshaper (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wanted: Players who wish to choose the feat, skill, or ability they want when they need it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new base class is designed for use by player characters at every level of play, allowing the character to emulate skills, feats, class abilities, and monstrous abilities. The taskshaper can also change shape from alter self to form of the dragon. The taskshaper can curse shapeshifters, trapping them in forms of the PC's choice, or with but a touch turn a foe into a music box playing the PC's theme song. This class can also be easily introduced into any new campaign with a simple plug-and-play first-person introduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Secrets of the Taskshaper is brought to you by the same designer who crafted the hugely successful Book of Monster Templates and the best-selling Feats 101. In addition, the product is the third book in &amp;quot;The Secrets of&amp;quot; series, following The Secrets of Martial Mastery and The Secrets of Divine Channeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
