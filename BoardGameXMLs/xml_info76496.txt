			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shadow of Fane - a 3.5 OGL fantasy adventure for 3rd Level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tower of Fane has stood as a brooding monument overlooking the old mountain path between the village of Mazula and Olthorn for a thousand years. Once home to Fane, a powerful wizard who made war on the people of south and wreaked his terror upon them, he was eventually defeated and trapped in his tower. A terrible curse was put upon that place - that he should never again walk upon the lands of Arrasia and would remain locked in his tower for all eternity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So the journey to the Tower of Fane continues, as rumors of kobolds attacking merchants on the old mountain path, and tales of the rise of Fane, remain as yet uninvestigated. Are these two events linked? Has Fane broken free of the ancient curse that binds him to his tower and prepares to make war once again on the people of the South? The truth yet awaits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shadow of Fane is part 2 in The Last Mage of Mount Fane trilogy, though can be played as an independent, stand alone adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- a 3.5 OGL fantasy adventure for 3rd level characters by Keith Robinson&lt;br/&gt;- illustrated by Gillian Pearce and Danilo Moretti&lt;br/&gt;- cover art by Anne Stokes&lt;br/&gt;- cartography by Keith Robinson&lt;br/&gt;- 41 pages, including 11 illustrations, 4 maps, and a bonus trilogy map!&lt;br/&gt;- fully bookmarked PDF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
