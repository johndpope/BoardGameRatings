							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Working Bee</name>
									
			<description>Players each control a hive and the worker bees within.  Each turn players must choose between expanding their hive, creating new workers, collecting pollen and attacking other hives.  Opportunities and choices exist on every turn, but timing and luck are critical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must decide which workers to deploy, whilst trying to out-think your opponents.  Take risks by gambling for extra actions, and play the odds for Events that can both help and hinder all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player whose hive and workforce is the largest after 12 turns is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working Bee is a luck-driven strategy game for 2-4 players aged 10 and up that plays in around 45 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
