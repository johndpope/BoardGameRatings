							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">High Seas Gadgeteering: Maritime Accessories for the Gadgeteer Base Class</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ahoy, lubber! This is how it be done on the high seas!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They say that a man is defined by his surroundings and that he cannot make that which he cannot imagine. Take gadgeteering to the high seas and beyond with this collection of nautical-themed accessories for the gadgeteer base class!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Emergency Skiff - Going down with the ship? With a pull of a string, the prepared gadgeteer has a fully-functional rowboat ready to go. Can be upgraded to include a sail, light ballista, improved hit points, increased acceleration, and an improved cargo capacity. (5 addons)&lt;br/&gt;     The Gizmocast Fishing Pole - Don't make the mistake of thinking that the gizmocast is just an ordinary fishing pole. This option for ranged combat specialists allows the gadgeteer to cast various &amp;quot;gizmobobbers&amp;quot;, which do everything from heal in a small radius to trigger conical bursts of whalesong in a remote location. The number of bobbers that can be cast in a round is limited only by the gadgeteer's base attack bonus and reload speed, so those who normally use a crossbow will find a fishing pole to be their &amp;quot;extreme prejudice&amp;quot; weapon of choice. (9 addons)&lt;br/&gt;     The Parrot Producer - Edward Hugh succeeded in creating any living creature he could desire, so long as what he desired was a parrot. Create horribly mutated birds, from tonight's supper and guard birds to flying grapeshot and salty sailors extraordinaire. Just try not to feel too badly when their genetic defects finally do them in. Or when they explode. It happens. (11 addons)&lt;br/&gt;     The Spermaceti Launcher - Picture flaming oil slicks that burn when you walk in, burn when you fall down, and burn when you try to stand back up. Couple that with a flamethrower and a fine spray of ultra-flammable wax that can be ignited FOR MASSIVE DAMAGE and you have the shootiest gadgeteer accessory yet. (6 addons)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
