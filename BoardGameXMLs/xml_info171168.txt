			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was the last days of Heaven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of Heaven used to shine with the light of God, but as you poshed deeper and deeper into the Fallen Lands, all you saw was darkness and horror and rot. The Light of God did not enter these lands. It wasn't that it couldn't, but the God Himself had denied his most treacherous children the light. In the lack of light, the crops withered and faded, and the topsoil eroded. Winds whipped stinging sand across most of the land, all except those few fields where the Fallen Angels created enough light for plants to struggle into something resembling life. A treacherous, half existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There you walk, mile after mile of desolation around you. Few mortals live this far into the Fallen Lands. this is a place of the foul betrayers of God, the Fallen Angels. Around you, endless stretches of bitterness, hate and fury. The fate of those who'd risen against their Fallen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the fourth adventure in the Moving Shadow campaign. This adventure, On Corrupted Ground, is the third of a ten part series that will take a group of characters through the Mortal Realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
