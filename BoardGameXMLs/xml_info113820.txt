							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legend Table Top Roleplaying Game System (Beta)</name>
									
			<description>From website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About Legend&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legend is a tabletop RPG developed by an independent team of gamers over the course of two years. Building on the foundations of the Open Gaming License, Legend has created a new and novel system dedicated to cinematic combat and a smoother gameplay experience. Legend takes familiar core mechanics and incorporates them into a new system emphasizing versatility, balance and fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legend was designed, as our name suggests, with the &amp;ldquo;Rule of Cool&amp;rdquo; in mind. We have a strong core game where abilities matter, classes are designed for broad appeal and customization is key. When you take a feat, you&amp;rsquo;re investing in a significant and valuable ability. Our system allows you to &amp;ldquo;multiclass&amp;rdquo; vertically rather than horizontally, exchanging part of your class for part of another wholesale rather than having to choose between concept and playability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eight Core Classes covering a wide variety of archetypes, with supplementary material ready to customize them further.&lt;br/&gt;All-new Feats represent significant expansions of your character&amp;rsquo;s abilities &amp;ndash; no more feat chain filler!&lt;br/&gt;Rewritten spellcasting puts a check on &amp;ldquo;linear warriors, quadratic wizards&amp;rdquo; while still giving casters a breadth of options.&lt;br/&gt;The Track system allows you to tailor your character to your concept, multiclassing without trading away power or utility.&lt;br/&gt;Twelve months of free downloadable content.&lt;br/&gt;As part of the Child&amp;rsquo;s Play charity initiative, all proceeds from the core product will be donated to Child&amp;rsquo;s Play &amp;ndash; not just on launch day but forever!&lt;br/&gt;Optional Legendary rules allow you to tailor the scope of individual encounters or even the entire game!&lt;br/&gt;Still unconvinced? Read a review and take a look at some sample pages! Then, get the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
