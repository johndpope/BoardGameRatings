							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frozen Depths</name>
									
			<description>Frozen Depths is a roguelike game with a cold theme and ASCII graphics.&lt;br/&gt;Frozen Depths has only one dungeon and no outer world. You can freeze to death if you can't keep yourself warm and it gets colder when you travel deeper into the dungeon. You can find clothes and wear them so that the cold air doesn't get into your bones as fast. Like in other roguelike games, you have only one life and then it's over. There are different level themes, four different dungeon generators and a large pool of handcrafted special floors to explore, five of these will be randomly picked every time you play. You'll get to face five cunning bosses before your ultimate victory. There are also different kinds of randomly generated superior monsters, slightly adjusted and better than normal ones but often easier than bosses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
