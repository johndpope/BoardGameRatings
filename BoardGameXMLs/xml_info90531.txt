			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MotoGP is a PSP game, and the series&amp;rsquo; first foray into the portable platforms market. The game is based on the 2005 racing season, and features most of the aspects that have become standard in the series. The title is a mix of arcade and simulation style motocross.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can choose from any of the riders from the &amp;rsquo;05 season and race on 8 of the tracks from the championship. There are two modes in the game: Season and Arcade. Season mode allows the player to control a racer from the championship for a season or have a generic character that participates in multiple seasons. Seasons last for eight races, and earned points are dependent on how well a racer places on each track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arcade mode has players choose a racetrack and participate in a single race. It is possible to link up with up to 7 friends for a multiplayer race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
