							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Damn the Torpedoes!</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;On August 5, 1864, Admiral Farragut led a flotilla of 14 wooden ships, four ironclads, and numerous gunboats into Mobile Bay to seal off the city of Mobile, one of the two remaining Confederate ports.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;While entering the bay, the Union monitor USS Tecumseh struck a submerged torpedo and sank. Under fire from both the Confederate fleet and Fort Morgan, Farragut had to choose between retreating or risking the minefield. He then issued his famous order, 'Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead!'&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Though both ironclad and wooden ships fought at Mobile Bay, this game gives players the opportunity to see how an all ironclad engagement may have been fought with ships of varying designs, and consider the trade offs naval engineers must make when designing a warship.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This &amp;quot;build your own ironclad&amp;quot; game is a miniatures wargame intended for use with students. The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table which recreates characteristics of Mobile Bay, including islands, forts, water depth, pilings, and mines. Components necessary for play are available for free download at the Junior General website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
