							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">REBUKE: My People</name>
									
			<description>OVERVIEW:&lt;br/&gt;While playing the original REBUKE, do you often times enjoy when a Talk About It card is discussed? Well, have I got some good news for you. This deck is filled to the brim with nothing but Talk About It cards. You have 2 options. Do you shuffle a few of these cards into the original REBUKE game to create a new experience or do you treat this expansion as its own game and solely play and discuss Talk About It cards as a group? Enjoy the game either way you choose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EXPANSION FOR THE ORIGINAL REBUKE:&lt;br/&gt;The My People expansion can be used in conjunction with the original REBUKE. In order to play a game with this expansion first locate the 12 Talk About It cards in the original REBUKE. Remove these Talk About It cards from the Deck and replace them with 12 Talk About It cards from this expansion. Or you can mix and match these cards together as long as there is 12 in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All expansion cards are identified by an &amp;quot;E:2&amp;quot; at the top right hand corner. This shows the difference between the cards of the expansion and cards of the game. Now you are all set to play REBUKE. Follow the original REBUKE Rules because they are still played the same way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REBUKE: MY People GAMEPLAY:&lt;br/&gt;When treating REBUKE: My People as a stand-alone game, the amount of maximum players can be 7. Shuffle all the cards together and place them in the middle of the playing field. This will be the Deck. Pick a player, that player will be the Drawer for the rest of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turns consists of the Drawer drawing the top card of the Deck and reading aloud the card topic. The Drawer will voice his/her opinion of the topic first. Once he/she has finished speaking that player will pass the card to the player on the right. The player on the right will now be able to voice their opinion of the topic and like-wise pass the card down in the same manner. This continues until all players have had a chance to speak. Once all players have spoken, then the Talk About It card is placed into the Discard Pile. The Discard Pile is located next to the Draw stack. That turn is now over and a new turn begins with the Drawer drawing from the Deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this version of the game there is no winners or losers its purely about discussion. Make sure not to interrupt while a player is speaking. The game ends once all the cards have been discussed. The Talk About It cards can be pulled from both the original REBUKE and the Heavy Burdens expansion to add even more topics to My People gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
