							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dem Gems</name>
									
			<description>Dem Gems is a quick play micro game and the theme of Dem Gems is rather abstract, you're collecting gems in a stoney looking labyrinth as a small coloured cylinder.... Basically you are there to collect as many gems as possible in an ever changing maze while you try to avoid holes, bombs and other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are narrow domino cards which are first shuffled and then 8 of them are laid out face up to make a 4 x 4 square board. The remaining cards are then dealt out equally face down to the players, any remaining cards are put to one side. Each player puts their piece at a corner (not on the board yet) and rolls the die to determine who goes first. &lt;br/&gt;You roll the die and you MUST move your piece that number of spaces even if it means losing gems! After you have moved you then place one of your cards from your hand onto the board to change the layout. This can be to your advantage or to sabotage another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep track of your scores with a notepad and pen to make it easier and once all players have played their cards and had an equal number of turns you count up the scores. The player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
