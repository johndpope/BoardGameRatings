			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following on the commercial success of Soccer, in 1979 Mattel produced Soccer 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player is represented by a bright LED.  The player always plays against a computer-controlled defense, indicated by several less-bright LEDs.  The player has four directional controls and may move around a play grid representing the play field.  The player may strike with a control button - strikes are more likely to score the closer the player is to the goal (indicated by a printed icon).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In two-player mode, the unit is handed back and forth with each player playing against the computer-controlled defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game differs from its predecessor by the addition of a full play field and offering numerous minor refinements including passing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
