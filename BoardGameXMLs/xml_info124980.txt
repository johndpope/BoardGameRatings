			<description>Once upon a time, there were three little piggybanks who lived together in a big, brick house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One night, while the piggies were fast asleep, a pack of wolves broke into their home and stole their precious stash of hard-earned coins from right under their little piggy noses! The piggybanks awoke to find their window broken and all their coins gone... The piggybanks hurried outside to find the fiendish wolves running off with their loot, leaving a trail of stolen coins as they fled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Get back here!&amp;quot; one of the piggies cried.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And so, the three little piggybanks set off on a madcap chase to retrieve their stolen coins from the wicked wolves...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
