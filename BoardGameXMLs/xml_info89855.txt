							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Airport Terminal</name>
									
			<description>Meridian, who previously launched 3 classic Time Management titles, has brought you the brand new Airport Terminal. Being the first title in the genre to use airports as main theme, you will be able run ones from different countries, making sure everything flows as smoothly as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like most Time Management games, your objective is to satisfy your customers with fast and efficient service. From check-in to boarding, passengers will require a lot of attention from you.  It's your job to make sure they pass through various stages without becoming stressed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will be able to take on the roles of ground staff checking in your passengers, a shopkeeper selling souvenirs, and even the custom officers who make sure that little girl with a pistol doesn't get on the flight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the unique features in this new title is that game flow is divided into two parts: Check-in lobby and Restricted area. You will be able to play two distinctive scenes in each stage and follow the real procedure of boarding an aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
