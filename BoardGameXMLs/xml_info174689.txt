			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt; The object of Fishing Camp - To be the first person to travel from the docks, catch a fish or multiple fish, and get back to the docks with their catch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fishing Camp is a roll-and-move fishing trivia game in which player move along a track trying to catch a fish before reaching the home space.  All player start out at the dock with a fishing boat playing piece.  They choose a level of difficulty from 1 to 4 for their questions.  This is a way to handicap the game.  Older or more experienced fishermen should choose a higher number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player in turn rolls the die and moves along a track marked with lily pads.  Green lily pads are safe spots.  On a yellow (or orange) lily pad, the player must choose a question card and answer a fishing trivia question at their level.  A decoder (transparent red plastic) is used to reveal the answer.  If the answer is correct, the player rolls and moves again.  If the card depicts a fish, the player keeps it and has now made a catch.  If the card says so, the player may take the GPS card (of which there is only one), which may allow him or her to take a shortcut along the path.  Purple cards may move the player to &amp;quot;Shore Lunch Island&amp;quot; or other locations, possibly delaying him or her.  The first player to move completely around the track and reach a &amp;quot;Home&amp;quot; space with at least one caught fish wins the game.  However, if a player finished without a fish, he or she may move immediately to &amp;quot;Last Chance Launch&amp;quot; and move toward the home space from there, attempting to catch a fish along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
