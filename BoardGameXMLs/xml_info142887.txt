							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Book Bug Game</name>
									
			<description>An instructional game, designed to increase familiarity with books and interest in reading them.  Intended for teachers and librarians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns drawing Question cards, which have trivia questions based on children's literature.  Depending on their answer, they may advance or retreat on a track, and may draw another card.  If questions and answers are not read aloud, the player retreats one space.  The first player to reach the 'finish' space wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are of several types, some which send the player back spaces, some which send the player forward, and some with open-ended questions intended to inspire further interest in reading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The named 'special' spaces on the board do not appear to have any game effect, but the characters depicted are given write-ups, as are the Book Bugs themselves, in the 'activity pamphlet'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
