							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Metamorphica, Revised Edition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Random Mutation Tables&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your game has a need for random mutation tables and procedures for creating all sorts of mutant abominations or unnatural things, whether they are corrupt demons and unique monsters or strange aliens and new superheroes, The Metamorphica is the book for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a collection of biological, psychic, and supernatural mutations, all grouped into tables so results can be randomly selected using dice, this book is a system-agnostic resource for campaigns of such diverse genres as dark fantasy, four-colour comic book, post-apocalypse, modern horror, science fiction, transhumanism, and weird high fantasy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Metamorphica contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Over 700 individual mutations, all with their own descriptions.&lt;br/&gt;    Physical and mental mutations, as well as psychic and supernatural powers.&lt;br/&gt;    Several different types of mutation-generating tables, from mad-libs to genre-specialized lists of specific details.&lt;br/&gt;    Lengthy random creature tables.&lt;br/&gt;    Procedures for using mutations in post-apocalyptic, sci-fi, superhero, and fantasy campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;    Procedures for creating aliens, demons, and monsters.&lt;br/&gt;    Procedures for creating mutant animals, humans, and plants.&lt;br/&gt;    New procedures and extensive tables for generating scientific devices and magic items, exactly the kind of equipment strange, mutated creatures might be carrying around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This revised edition has also been re-organized for easier use, numerous mutations have been revised, new mutations have been added, and there are more tables for generating specific details for aliens, demons, monsters, mutant animals, and the various campaign settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The classic edition of The Metamorphica is still available and still free, but hopefully you will prefer this revised edition, which is more than 100 pages longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
