			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A graphical adventure game from Infogrames, with a point-and-click interface and cartoony graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1960'. New Haven. Connecticut.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his sordid room, Peter, lying dejectedly on his bed, contemplated the wall with a mournful eye.&lt;br/&gt;Debts were mounting up and there was no glimmer of hope on the horizon.&lt;br/&gt;He hardly dared move outside his room for fear of meeting one of his many creditors. Things were looking desperate when there was a knock at the door.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A letter for you&amp;quot;, cried the caretaker's voice.&lt;br/&gt;To his surprise he found an airline ticket to Las Vegas together with $200. A short note accompanied these welcome gifts.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Your aunt has just died making you sole heir to her fortune. However, there is one condition, you have to repeat her achievement of the thirties to win a million dollars in one night in Las Vegas.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;There wasn't a moment to lose if he wanted to avoid his creditors.&lt;br/&gt;He got out of the building and a race across town ensued. And all for the sake of an eccentric old woman. &amp;quot;How can I shake off my pursuer&amp;quot;, he mused.&lt;br/&gt;So get to where the action is and set off now for the depraved city that's known as LAS VEGAS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
