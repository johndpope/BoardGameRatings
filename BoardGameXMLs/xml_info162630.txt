			<description>This is a car racing game. The start of the cars is determined by dice. Further movement happens according to speed markers (10, 20, 30 and 40 km/h)at the choice of the players. At higher speeds there is also a higher risk to get in an accident at the more dangerous spaces of the race track or through events on the obstacle cards. There are 22 obstacle cards and 8 luck cards wich are dealt to the players at the beginning of the race. The players can play the cards to hinder other players or to press their own advantage. The first player to complete 4 laps on the race track wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
