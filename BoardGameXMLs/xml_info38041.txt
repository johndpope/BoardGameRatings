			<description>A fun game of bluff for 2-4 players Ages 7 and up, using 33 fact-filled cards on Marvel Super Heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game play is similar to a card-based version of Liar's Dice.  Each player selects a number of cards from their hand, passes to the player on the left and announces e.g. &amp;quot;3 Blue&amp;quot;. The receiving player can then accept the statement as truth and take the cards or challenge it as a bluff. If they're right, the active player has to reduce their score by the announced value. If they're right, they must reduce their score. First one to lose 15 points is the loser.  Bids must increase until a challenge is made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game box has an integrated scoring track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several other versions of this game.  The first set consists of Marvel Heroes, Ben 10, Baby Animals, Horses, Monster Jam, and Dinos.  Other than the card art the games appear to be identical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
