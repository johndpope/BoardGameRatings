			<description>website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;This is a game set in a medieval world where the gods have either fled or have withdrawn their blessings and protection from the majority of the population. As a result it is coming under increasing attack from Diabolic forces. A number of Diabolic Princes are competing to convert or conquer the nations of men and all that stands between them and victory are a few bands of heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These travel from land to land on quests to drive back the forces of the Diabolic Princes. Sometimes they are successful, oftimes they are not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspiration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some readers will quickly recognise that these rules owe a considerable debt to the Diablo series of computer rpg&amp;rsquo;s, especially Diablo II. Unlike the previous D&amp;amp;D version though, these rules and the setting have not slavishly copied the computer game, but transferred its core ideas to a simpler format and similar setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
