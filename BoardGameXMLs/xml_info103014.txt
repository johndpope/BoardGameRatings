			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Higher Education Alias is yet another new version of the classic game Alias. &lt;br/&gt;This version takes all the words from previous versions and puts them together into groups. While in other games the goal was simply explain the words to other people without using anything from the word explained, then in this one you have 8 words on a card and when you the red words and use other words on that card to explain that word (in a way that makes sense) you score extra points.&lt;br/&gt;Also this version is now a shorter game as well, since the scoring track is now lot shorter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
