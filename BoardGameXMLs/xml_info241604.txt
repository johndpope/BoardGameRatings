			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A notice posted in New Sarshel reads:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Barony of Timbertown welcomes adventurers! There is plenty of scope for bold and hardy souls to reap rich rewards, carving a reputation &amp;ndash; and perhaps a fortune &amp;ndash; out of the Barony's wilderness. If you are lucky, you may find yourself with titles and lands of your own. Baron Ferrand Galadhor has the authority to bestow titles on whomsoever he deems worthy, and all lands in his demesne are his to grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;From slaying foul fiends to thwarting goblin invasions, Timbertown has need of those of stout heart and cunning mind. In short, of heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Take your place among them and stamp your name on history! Come to Timbertown today!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
