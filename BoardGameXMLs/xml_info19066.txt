							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cuban Missile Crisis: 1962</name>
									
			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Thirteen days in October 1962 nearly brought the world to the brink of thermonuclear war. Fortunately, with a combination of political maneuvering and luck, President Kennedy resisted his advisor's  insistence for invasion and finally convinced Nikita Khrushchev to remove the Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba in exchange for removal of US &amp;quot;Jupiter&amp;quot; missiles in Turkey. What would have happened if no agreement had been reached? What form would the US invasion of Cuba have taken if Kennedy had listened to his advisor's? What would the Soviet response be? Time to find out!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this, you'll be provided with the game's mapsheets, rules, charts, etc., while you will utilize the components from Axis &amp;amp; Allies or related games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
