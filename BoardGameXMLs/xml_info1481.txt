			<description>On your forehead you have a card that names you as a famous person, dead or alive. Everybody can see it and knows who you are - except you! You have to discover your mystery identity by interrogating the other players: Am I dead? Am I fat? Can I sing? Am I a bore? Personalities range from cartoon characters, to politicians, to movie stars. There's a limit to how many questions you can ask - so choose carefully. The more questions it takes, the lower the player's score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;100 famous names on cards, 1 headband, instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
