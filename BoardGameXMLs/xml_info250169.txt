							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">50 Motivators for Wasteland Survivors</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Living in a ruined world after the collapse of society can take its toll on someone. Survivors need more than just physical ability and a supply of resources. They also need a desire to keep going. So what makes a particular survivor tick? What&amp;rsquo;s their goals, desires, or reason to keep going? This list provides 50 different possible motivators for the GM to roll up for non-player characters as needed. The list is also good for a player who hasn&amp;rsquo;t quite decided on the angle or driving urge for their own character. The list is also perfectly fine for a zombie apocalypse game as well as any campaign world where folks are wandering about in an effort to stay alive and have needs met.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
