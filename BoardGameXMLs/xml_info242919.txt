			<description>The game represents the struggle between four major empires of the ancient world. Each side consists of two empires working together, players taking the part of either one or two empires depending on the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;  The board consists of a map of the Med with a number of routes marked on it along which certain pieces may move. The rest of the components consist of 7 playing pieces for each empire, a standard pack of cards and 2 pairs of special cards. Each set of 7 consists of 1 elephant, 1 knight, 3 soldiers and 2 ships. Each empire starts with all the even cards in their suit and will later draw the odd cards one by one.&lt;br/&gt;  The pieces have different movement abilities and battles occur when one piece attempts to move to a town occupied by an enemy piece.&lt;br/&gt; Battles are decided by the opposing players each taking two cards from their hand and placing them face down on the table and then the cards are revealed simultaneously, with some clever subtleties.&lt;br/&gt; The object of the game is to either eliminate all opposing pieces or occupy both opposing capitals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
