							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aeryandris</name>
									
			<description>From deity &amp;quot;Description:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aeryandris is commonly depicted as a middleaged, bearded man wearing scholarly robes and a multitude of priceless rings, necklaces, and other jewelry. This god epitomizes the fruits of a civilized and orderly society: commerce and wealth, craftsmanship, knowledge, diplomacy, and law. His priests, the Acolytes of Order, seek to emulate Aeryandris and work toward filling their temples&amp;rsquo; coffers and libraries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aeryandris dwells in the city of Myrias, in a huge, sprawling, seaside castle called Tartessys. The walls of Tartessys are covered with precious metals and gems, and they are surrounded by shops and bazaars. Inside are a number of workshops, manned by the spirits of those who were master craftsmen in life. The center of Tartessys contains a huge library, miles across in size. It is said to contain all the knowledge about every topic imaginable in the Material, Near, or Far Realms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
