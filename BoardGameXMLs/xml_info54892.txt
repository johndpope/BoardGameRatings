			<description>[Introduction]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waterworld  is  a  campaign  setting designed  to  work  with  the  Fallout Pencil  and  Paper  Roleplaying  Game system  by  Jason  Mical,  adapted  from  the computer-based  SPECIAL  system  designed  by Interplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although it uses the same system (with  some  slight  modifications),  the setting  isn't  anywhere  near  the  familiar, Interplay-created  &amp;quot;retro-future&amp;quot;  of  the computer games, or the original core rules - so  forget  places  like  Vault  City  and  the Great  Wastes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In  fact,  the  Waterworld &amp;quot;world&amp;quot; is a different Earth altogether; if you  have  to  rationalize  it  and  work  it  in with  &amp;quot;canon&amp;quot;  Fallout  locations,  just  think &lt;br/&gt;that Waterworld is on an Earth in one of an infinite number of parallel dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waterworld  takes  place  in  the  distant future:  at  least  the  year  3100  AD,  if  not farther.  Global warming, and  perhaps other factors like a nuclear war, have melted the Earth's  icecaps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The  entire  planet  is  one vast  ocean,  unending  and  harsh.    Humanity managed  to  survive,  but  exists  in  small, isolated communities that dot the surface of the  planet.    The  oceans  are populated with strange,  new  creatures,  the  product  of evolution's  encouraging  hand  -  natural  or otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
