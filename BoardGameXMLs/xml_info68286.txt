			<description>PentaKribb is billed as &amp;quot;Boardless Cribbage&amp;quot;. Instead of the traditional board, players are provided a scoring sheet to post their hands and scores. Players are not dealt their own, individual hands. Instead, the dealer turns a single card face up. The players enter that card onto their own score sheet, placing it into the square of their choice in a 4 x 5 grid. This is repeated until all 20 spaces are filled in. The dealer then turns over a single cut card. The result is 5 hands of 5 cards for each player. The scores are added up for all the hands. This is repeated for five deals. The highest score at the end of the five deals wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From published rules on the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
