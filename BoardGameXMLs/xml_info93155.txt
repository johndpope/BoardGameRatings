			<description>The box contains a number of parts that allow you to play one of two games; Tiny Clangers Party or Tunnels and Trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiny Clangers Party involves going around the board trying to visit 3 planets to collect 3 different presents and be the first to arrive at the Party in the middle of the board.  Movement is by rolling dice, although you can collect and use pennies to add 1 to your move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flip the board over and you're ready to play Tunnels and Trees, which is just Snakes and Ladders in Space.  Players roll dice to move along the board-track, with some spaces shuttling them ahead, and some sending them back to previous spaces.  There's nothing original about Tunnels and Trees, but it does let you pretend that you're a Clanger inside their planet trying to get out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
