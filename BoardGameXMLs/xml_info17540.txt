			<description>From the Invisible City Productions website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A race game with a twist for two to four players, played with a printable board and 6 nickels, dimes, quarters, and pennies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: To get your pieces from the corners of the board to the exit at the center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, select a square with one or more of your coins in it. Flip all of those coins, counting heads as one point and tails as two points. Take the sum of your flips and move your coins in the chosen square that many spaces away from it. You must use your full movement on each coin. If your coins land on a square occupied by an opponent&amp;rsquo;s coin, take another turn to move those same coins. If your coins land on a vacant square, your turn ends. If your coins land on the center diamond, remove them from the board. This ends your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning: The first player with no pieces left on the board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
