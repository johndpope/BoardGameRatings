			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On September 1st, 2010, Purple Duck Games released its most successful product, Legendary Blades. This inexpensive tome provided gamemasters and players access to 16 legendary swords that  grow with a character without requiring the player to make huge sacrifices to maintain the weapon or causing the weapon and its legends to become the driving force for a whole campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great weapons that scale easier was the goal and players, game masters and reviewers agreed that it was a hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stefen Styrsky and Mark Gedak have returned to write the second volume in this series Legendary Weapons. Building on the strong foundation laid down in the initial release they have crafted another 14 legendary weapons from the Apocalypse Hammer designed to hasten the end of the world to the Woodman's Axe designed to tear the heart out of malevolent plants and their ilk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every true hero needs a legendary weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
