							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">RuneQuest Star Wars</name>
									
			<description>From the &amp;quot;Introduction&amp;quot; section:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most owners of RuneQuest 6th Edition will probably have purchased it with the intent to run games set in traditional fantasy settings. As it stands the book can pretty much cover anything from historical Neolithic hunter-gatherers to Arabian Nights Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery. Yet the underlying mechanics of RuneQuest are flexible enough to represent any genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course a Game Master needs to invest a little more work if planning to run a game in an atypical setting. Whilst the Design Mechanism intends to publish some more modern setting books in the future, this article is the first of an informal series to show just how easy it is to make your own conversions (commonly known as &amp;lsquo;hacks&amp;rsquo;) to play in the more infamous Sci-Fi and Fantasy worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start the ball rolling we&amp;rsquo;ll show how you can use RQ6 to run a Star Wars based game, which is about as far removed from S&amp;amp;S as can be imagined. Although you could use this document to support an entire campaign, its true purpose is to stimulate creativity and show what key areas you need to change in order to fully support the setting within the rules. Enjoy! And may the force be with you...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
