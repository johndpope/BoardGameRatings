			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;$7000 Dollar Movie is a story roleplaying game about passionate people making the sequel to a dreadful B-Movie. That original “film” languished for years before finally being released to a limited number of screens. Portions of the film were damaged from years of neglect. That, along with production problems, delays, illness, and actor changes, meant the final piece played out like a glitter-stained collage of leftover jigsaw pieces. All the while, the characters appeared as nothing more than random bits of nonsense drawn from the imagination of a confused screenwriter. Needless to say it became a cult classic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encouraged by these surprising results, the director used the profits to pay back investors (parents) and fund a sequel. But can he duplicate the previous madness on purpose or will it be the bomb critics are anticipating?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protocol is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters together into dramatic situations. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
