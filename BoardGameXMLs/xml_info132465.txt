			<description>&amp;quot;Color Cube 81&amp;quot; is a set of wooden blocks for board games that were designed for educational purposes by DALA Edutainment's representative Professor Julian. Various games can be enjoyed with 81 of these pastel-colored wooden blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first board game created with &amp;quot;Color Cube 81&amp;quot; was &amp;quot;Color Match&amp;quot;, followed by &amp;quot;High Tower&amp;quot;, and new games are constantly being created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a game played with blocks that was developed by Professor Julian and his students through JACC (julian's Arts Creation Class), focusing on fields of Art and Education to flourish everyday lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Color Match: you gather as many cubes as possible through matching same colored cubes, which is made more fun by 'drawing'.  The important point is to gather the variety of all 6 colors; red, orange, yellow, green, blue and wooden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Tower: a game which the player with the highest stack of cubes of a color at the end of game wins. You select a cube of your color and stack it on the top of another of your cubes.  The cubes that were between those 2 cubes can all be taken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
