			<description>With magical pyramids Tic-tac-toe changes into a three-dimensional challenge. The situation on the board is moving fast and simple rule forces the starting player to activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playrs place their pyramids on 3x3 grid board to form a Troika.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TROIKA is any combination of your own pyramids in which the two basic parameters (color and size) occur either in the ratio 3:0:0 or 1:1:1 (either all the same or all different).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Draw is not possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preparation of the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need one trio each of white, yellow, red, blue, green and black pyramids.&lt;br/&gt;Players divide pyramids. One of the players has all nine pyramids of lighter colors (white, yellow, red), the second has all nine pyramids of darker colors (green, blue, black).&lt;br/&gt;Start of the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The younger player rolls the die. The player with the color on the die starts. Players consecutively place one of their pyramids on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Placing of Pyramids&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have to place one pyramid per turn. Once laid pyramids can not be moved during the rest of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pyramids can be placed on free fields, yours or your opponent's pyramids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attention! Pyramids can not be placed on pyramids of the same size nor on pyramids two size bigger/smaller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When laying pyramids may therefore occur following four options. You can lay down:&lt;br/&gt;any pyramid on a free field&lt;br/&gt;small pyramid on any middle pyramid&lt;br/&gt;middle pyramid on any small or large pyramid&lt;br/&gt;large pyramid on any middle pyramid&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only top pyramid counts for the goal!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to create a TROIKA of pyramids lying in one row or one column, or the two main diagonals on the 3x3 board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TROIKA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TROIKA is any combination of your own pyramids in which the two basic parameters (color and size) occur either in the ratio 3:0:0 or 1:1:1 (either all the same or all different).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Examples:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large red, medium red and small red do form a TROIKA, because their color scheme is 3:0:0 (three red, no white, no yellow) and size scheme is 1:1:1 (one large, one medium and one small pyramid).&lt;br/&gt;Medium blue, medium green and medium black do form a TROIKA, because their color scheme is 1:1:1 (one blue, one green, one black) and size structure is 3:0:0 (three medium, no large and no small pyramid).&lt;br/&gt;Large blue, medium blue and small green do not form a TROIKA, because their color scheme is 2:1:0 (two blue, one green and no black pyramid)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Troika Training&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To explain the rules it always helps when you form several TROIKAS, especially if you play with school children. Take any two pyramids and challenge players to find the third pyramid required to form a Troika. Practice this several times.&lt;br/&gt;End Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the first player creates TROIKA in a row or column or one of two main diagonals on the board. This player is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player has at least one of his pyramids, but cannot place any of them, he loses the game.&lt;br/&gt;If both players run out of all their pyramids and no player created TROIKA, the player who did NOT start the game, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(For this reason it is good to keep the die next to the game board.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules of 5 games: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.mwe.cz/images/gettingstartedwithpyramids.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.mwe.cz/images/gettingstartedwithpyramids.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To buy: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://mwe.cz/cart/index.php?route=product/product&amp;amp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://mwe.cz/cart/index.php?route=product/product&amp;amp&lt;/a&gt;;product_id=73&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
