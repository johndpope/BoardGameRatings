			<description>ChoroQ (known as Choro Q HG 4 in Japan)  is marketed as a hybrid of driving and role-playing video games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using events from the movie ChoroQ, #5 must prepare for and enter the 2004 Grand Prix and beat Otto of Team Getra at his grand prix.  The game opens with Norahike dreaming about a race. It includes him, his friend Norkia and Otto, the emperor of the races. Norkia dies after a fateful crash into the wall and when Norahike wakes up he realises that it is all true and that Otto may not be emperor for very long. #5 enters shortly after. A smart blue car called Barat tells him that he must join a team to race at the Grand Prix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;ChoroQ (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The role-playing side of the game has the player wander around a town and talk to others. There are many ways to modify the car for the races. The actual races are typical driving games with braking and acceleration, although you cannot crash with other cars. These races provide income for new modifications, making it easier to win other races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
