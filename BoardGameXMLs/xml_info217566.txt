			<description>From European cover&lt;br/&gt;Here is the entire Pinball Arcade purely for YOU - with full sound effects and four greatr playing fields to choose from - the robotic CYBER field, DOG FIGHT where you're a World Wae I fighter pilot, SPRING BREAK where you ride the waves and MELTDOWN is pure nuclear!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From French cover (Flipper Interactif)&lt;br/&gt;* See an entire pinball arcade with flashinglights, full digital sound effects and challenging playing fields materialize before your eyes. * The robotic CYBER combines fast action with a complicating factor: A magnet pops up from the robot's chest. Try to launch the ball from the magnet for higher scores.* Enter the fray of World War I in DOG FIGHT. Your mission is to shoot down Fokkers and other planes as you traverse the war-tone countryside. Your flippers have gas tanks on them so don't use them carelessly! * SPRING BREAK is filled with beach babes, surfer dudes and major wave action. Try to spell the words &amp;quot;spring break&amp;quot; by hitting the beach balls. Once you do, take a trip into the local cafe for bonus scores.&lt;br/&gt;* MELTDOWN is totally nuclear! It's your mission to set the control rids so you can get into the reactor core for full linear acceleration. * Are you adept enough to do it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
