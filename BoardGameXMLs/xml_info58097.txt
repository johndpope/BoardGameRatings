			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wedding Game, originally published in 1880, is a card game chronicling a Bride and Groom's trip to the altar. As in any wedding, players pay and receive according to directions, along the way picking up assorted bridesmaids, groomsmen, the Parson and a clerk while avoiding the Lawyer, the Bride's Aunt and a rejected suitor. During the game, if the lawyer is encountered, the wedding is postponed. Amazingly, little has changed in over 100 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of twenty-four charmingly illustrated character cards, twenty-five pay cards and complete instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
