The fielding can either be set manually or automatically. There are three difficulty settings to play at, Amateur, Professional and World Class. The game has pseudo-3D graphics with details such as the shadows of players moving as the sun moves. All test sides (in 1993) are included including a World XI team to play as. Batting averages and other statistics are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graham Gooch World Class Cricket has many different versions available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Allan Border cricket: The Australian release of the game.&lt;br/&gt;Battle for the Ashes: A cut down version made specifically for the 1993 Ashes Test series.&lt;br/&gt;Jonty Rhodes II - World Class Cricket: The South African release of the game.&lt;br/&gt;Brian Lara Cricket: An edition that was initially only available from the Game chain of stores in the UK.&lt;br/&gt;Shane Warne '97: An updated version with substantially the same gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were also two updates for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graham Gooch's Second Innings: This update disk required the original game to work, it contained all the updated statistics from 1994. The expansion also added the ability to play &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; matches such as the 1990 test where Graham Gooch scored his highest score, 333. The ability to play as an English county team is added.&lt;br/&gt;Graham Gooch World Class Cricket - Test Match Special Edition: This version of the game combines the original game with the 2nd Innings update.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After Graham Gooch's World Class Cricket, Audiogenic developed Brian Lara Cricket for the Sega Mega Drive which was licensed to Codemasters. In 1996 Codemasters took over the Audiogenic development team and then went on to release a series of cricket games under the Brian Lara and Shane Warne brands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Graham Gooch's World Class Cricket,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
