							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sesame Street Mother Goose Audio Card Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a simple card game for preschool children with a cute gimmick... the package includes a cassette tape of the Sesame Street characters reading classic nursery rhymes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards representing these nursery rhymes are distributed among the players. When the matching fairy tale (Humpty Dumpty, Jack Sprat, Old Mother Hubbard, etc.) is read by a character the kid holding that card tosses it away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The children gain and lose cards during a session because the spinner is twirled when the stories appear on the tape. The player holding the Mother Goose card at the end of the game is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no decisions to be made and there is no strategy. This is a basic introduction to card games for three year old kids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes 12 cards, spinner, cassette tape, plastic card holder, &lt;br/&gt;and the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
