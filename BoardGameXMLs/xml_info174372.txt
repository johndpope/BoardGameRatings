			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HMS Zealous was an Edgar class ship of the line. Similarly to the Bellona class, the Edgar class was one of the designs by Thomas Slade, using a slightly modified version of the original Arrogant design. Launched on June, 25th 1785, HMS Zealous served in a number of battles of the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars - notably the Battle of the Nile, where she engaged the French ship Guerriere, helping to force her surrender. This ship pack can also be used to represent the British Bellona Class ship-of-the-line &amp;quot;HMS Superb 1760&amp;quot;. Each Sails of Glory Ship Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other Sails of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the ship: a special base with gaming stats, a ship log and a specific deck of maneuver cards. The ship base, ship card and ship log are printed on two sides - The game data of a second ship is printed on the back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
