			<description>Are you a wizard who has taken on one too many apprentices? Maybe their skills aren't yet up to snuff. Well, here at Lucidorn's Academy for Gifted Magicians, we believe in giving a whole and holistic education. Your apprentices will be safe and content in a tower of likeminded peers as they learn the basics of spellcraft and wizardry, with a fatality rate of only 10% and a Dragon Star Rating of 4 out of 5!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Six-sided Spellbooks, you play as a wizard apprentice, casting spells, learning arcane runes, and fighting for the favour of your professors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, you will draw dice from a bag, roll them, and then use them as currency to create runes and collect points, or to gain the favour of your professors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the apprentice with the most points, the most runes, or the only one left alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game utilises a unique twist on worker placement mechanics, using rolled dice as different 'types' of workers, to pattern-match and puzzle-solve your way to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
