			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1989. As the civilized countries of the world exchange gifts of nuclear missiles, the small volunteer population of the Morrow Project sleep far away from the blossoming nuclear fireballs in a deep dreamless winter. These few people, long prepared for the holocaust which rages around them, await the time when their ever-watchful machines will awaken them. They expect the time of their cold sleep to be a mere three or four years but everything had gone well right up to the war and it was now that the infamous gremlin Murphy shifted the gears. The &amp;quot;cryonauts&amp;quot; sleep on for one hundred and fifty years before their delinquent machines finally restore them. One hundred and fifty years of eroding culture and technology; one hundred and fifty years of fall-out boosted mutations; one hundred and fifty years of dog-eat-dog survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Morrow Project you will take the role of one of these &amp;quot;cryonauts&amp;quot;, and by doing so place yourself in a situation of forced survival. You know nothing of the changeling world around you and find dangers around every turn. You will find yourself face-to-face with the conditions created after a nuclear war. Genetic mutations in almost every form of affected wildlife constantly surprise and endanger you; radioactive &amp;quot;hot spots&amp;quot; are an always present peril; and you find that the most dangerous animal left on Earth continues to be Mankind itself. Survival is the only rule left to a chaotic society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Somehow the separated Morrow Teams must contact one another, find their main base, and again bring civilization to the human race. They are Man's last hope for a future beyond survival, but mankind and the blasted forces of nature seem to unite in the task of destroying that last hope. Can the Morrow Teams survive in the world of 2139?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAN YOU SURVIVE???&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE MORROW PROJECT - 1989&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cult status game was originally set in 1989 - so what better year to try the Special Limited Edition Boxed Set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Morrow Project Rules - Normal Price &amp;pound;5.95 &lt;br/&gt;Liberation at Riverton - Normal Price &amp;pound;5.50 &lt;br/&gt;G.M.'s Screen - Normal Price &amp;pound;3.50&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All for &amp;pound;9.95&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
