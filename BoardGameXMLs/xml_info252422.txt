			<description>Each player gets a number of helpers in their color at the start of the game. Every time a player chooses to take money as their action, they may also roll 3 six sided dice. With these dice the player forms a result by adding and/or subtracting each die to the result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the result corresponds to a building number in his Alhambra, he can place a helper with the victory point side up on that building. Only one helper is allowed per building. With each scoring the player gets as many victory points as the biggest area of orthogonal adjacent helpers in his Alhambra. The helpers stay till the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the result matches a building number on the building market the player places a helper next to one of the 4 building spaces with the +1/-1 side up. Next time the player wants to buy a building from that space he can adjust the purchase price by +1 or -1 to make it easier to match the exact prize. Once he buys a building of that space he returns his helper to his supply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use your helpers to get the most points during scoring while also making it easier to get your desires buildings from the building market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 48 handymen tokens and 3 dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
