							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">50 Motivators for Fantasy Characters</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fantasy/sword and sorcery flavored edition of Fishwife Games&amp;rsquo; 50 motivators lists. From simple peasant to mighty hero to ruler of the land, all folks are motivated by some sense of gain, goal, or purpose. Is the individual in search of wealth and power or they in fact hiding from someone or some dark past. Do they seek to discover the hidden or gain knowledge about the unknown? Are they simply driven by baser aspects, such as bloodlust, lecherous cravings, or jealousy? Is the individual just simply trying to stay alive and get enough food in their gut to see another day? Use the percentile dice to quickly roll up the motivations of the non-player characters that the heroes may run into on their campaign quests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
