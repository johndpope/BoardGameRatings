			<description>Football related card game. Two decks of cards are provided. One is used for a Match number and the other is used for generating the results of the matches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an incredibly basic game considering the expense of producing a game with 127 cards in total. Each player is dealt an even number of Match cards. Then the match results are found, not by subtle, clever play. No, you draw a card and the result will be ticked in the card, either a Home Win (1 point scored), an Away Win (2 points scored) or a Draw (3 points scored). And that's it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three variations are provided but still the same game except for the solitaire patience-type game, but that is also dreary. The last rules relate to no game at all. The publishers suggest that you might like to fill in your Football Pools entry form by drawing cards randomly and applying the result to match 1 on the coupon, then match 2, and so on. I would imagine that this use of the cards was the main intention of the publisher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
