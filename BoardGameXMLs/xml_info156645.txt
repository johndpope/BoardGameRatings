							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Historical Folks: Conversion for use with GURPS Fourth Edition</name>
									
			<description>from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Collecting templates from over a dozen authors, Historical Folks was originally slated to be an official GURPS supplement. After its compilation, Steve Jackson Games decided not to go forward with the book and the rights reverted back to Brian C. Smithson. Brian decided to make this supplement freely available to the gaming community and spent many hour s turning the rough draft into a professional quality sourcebook, which has been downloaded and used by countless GURPS players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book updates the templates from Historical Folks to make them compatible for use with GURPS Fourth Edition. It is not a standalone product, as none of the design notes, customization notes, or sample characters have been copied over. Rather, think of this as an appendix to the original, updating it to the newest edition of GURPS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
