							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spare Parts: The Game of Undead Army Building</name>
									
			<description>In Spare Parts, players take on the role of mad scientists in the tradition of Dr. Frankenstein, racing to reanimate an army of undead creations and conqueror the world. The player with the most diabolical laugh gets to be the first to raid graveyards with the help of Igor and collect Spare Parts such as brains, lungs, and hearts. This loose collection of organs is brought back to the players lab where, with the help of a little electricity,  they attempt to reanimate the undead creations currently on their lab tables. As zombies are completed their uniquely engineered characteristics can be used to interfere with the competition, or speed up your race to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 11 different types of zombies each of which has an appropriate and unique cost to go with their ability. Lawyer zombies for instance only need lungs and brains- after all they only need to think and talk. The undead's special abilities are designed to keep competition close and give everyone a chance at victory- a careful mix of luck and strategy. The first player to amass an army of 6 undead creations wins the game and has permission to laugh and cackle manically for as long as they are able.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start the game with hand of five spare parts and two zombies recipes. At the beginning of each turn players draw two spare parts cards, and bring in fresh corpses to fill any empty lab tables. Players then play spare parts from their hand to match the costs of zombies they are building. Players can trade spare parts with other players on their turn to try to get the parts they need. When a zombie is completed it's special ability triggers, and it goes into the player's Army Pile. At the end of your turn you discard until your under your maximum had size. Play continues until a player has amassed an army of six zombies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
