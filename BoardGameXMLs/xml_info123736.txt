			<description>Greyhound racing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are suits matching the six greyhounds in each race. The deck is shuffled and some cards are dealt out and revealed. The number of cards removed can be chosen by the Bookie for the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards revealed mean that any greyhound, relating to the cards, has less cards in the deck than others. Each race one player is the Bookie. His job is to offer odds on the dogs, taking into account the number of cards revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players bet and the race is simple. Turn over a card and that dog moves one space forward. First dog to cross the finish line wins the race. Bookie pays out winning bets. Next player on his left becomes the Bookie for the next race. When the game ends, the one with the most money, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The same mechanism can be used with the alternative set of horse tokens that are supplied to yield a horse racing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
