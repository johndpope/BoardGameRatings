							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beavis and Butt-Head Do U</name>
									
			<description>For their second full-blown adventure game, the dimwitted duo heads out with the class on a field trip to Highland State College. At first they're not too revved on the idea, but when they remember that college is home to &amp;quot;college sluts&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;beer,&amp;quot; they're out of the classroom door and onto the Highland State campus faster than you can say &amp;quot;Fire! Fire!&amp;quot; Once there, Mr. Van Driessen tells them they've got to get the signatures of eight staff members to prove they spent the day learning about the benefits of a Highland State education - and if they do, they'll be rewarded by being allowed to attend a party at the end of the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beavis_and_Butt-Head_Do_U.
