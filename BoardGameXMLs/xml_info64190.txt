			<description>The game board is a 3D mountain (actually, it is pyramid-shaped). Each side is for one player and contains holes in which a rock climber can be inserted. &lt;br/&gt;The game iteself is a &amp;quot;roll and climb&amp;quot; with the players trying to reach the summit first. Dice determine the own movement and possible obstructions or support for one of the other players (whose game board side one cannot see!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
