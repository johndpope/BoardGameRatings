			<description>&lt;b&gt;From the publisher:[b/]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The North American B-25 Mitchell was an American twin engined medium bomber. It was used by many Allied air forces, in every theater of World War II, and saw service across four decades. It first gained fame for its use in the 18 April 1942 Tokyo Raid, in which 16 B-25Bs led by Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle attacked mainland Japan, four months after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW2 Wings of Glory&amp;trade; Special Pack is a ready-to-play large size model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW2 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards, as well as specific rules and components necessary to use the airplane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
