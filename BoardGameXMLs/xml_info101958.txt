							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cyber-Cafe</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob taps the desk impatiently as he waits for his e-mail client to finish logging in. He considers another cup of coffee to ward off the night chill, but his nerves already have him on edge. ...His nerves, and the people who ransacked his office and have been trying to kill him. He hopes they haven't cracked into his e-mail account yet. The friendly chime of his e-mail client is echoed by the door chime as a new customer enters the cyber-cafe. Jacob watches with a sinking feeling as the man surveys the room. Their eyes meet, and the stranger's eyes momentarily widen. In an explosion of movement, both men reach for their weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where do you go from here? To the battle map, of course! If you need a map of a modern structure, you need Modern Floorplans. The Modern Floorplans series from Fabled Environments and 12 to Midnight offers gamers high quality maps in a variety of configurations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Want to draw it out yourself? Use the 8.5&amp;times;11 map as a guide.&lt;br/&gt;     Want to simply drop the map on the table and play? Use either the 24&amp;times;36 full map (if you have access to a plotter printer) or print the tiled version on regular paper and assemble a full-size version yourself in a matter of minutes. Both versions are scaled at 1 inch equals 5 feet.&lt;br/&gt;     In addition, each floorplan also comes in versions without room labels and without furniture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: All floorplans are rendered in black and white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All maps are created by an architectural drafter using AutoCAD. This gives all of the maps the realistic feel that your players crave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Average Cyber-Cafe&lt;br/&gt;This floorplan works well as both a cyber-cafe or a coffee house. The floorplan includes spaces for computer terminals, a lounge, coffee bar, kitchen, computer server/storage, delivery area, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The maps in this title can also be found in Modern Floorplans Volume 2: Goin' Out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
