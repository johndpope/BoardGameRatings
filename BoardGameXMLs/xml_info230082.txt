			<description>A solitaire game for the decktet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kingdom is facing the biggest threat ever! Dark, ancient forces have returned and are unleashing their evil and terror causing destruction and mayhem. You are Jacynth's most famous adventurer given an important task - you must retrieve 6 pieces of an ancient artifact and bring it to the place where the ritual will be performed in order to destroy the source of this evil. Its minions will try to stop you along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you roll five six-sided dice in order to defeat enemies or overcome dificult terrain ahead of you. Every turn there are three cards in your path that can be one of three types: enemy, location or event. When you roll the dice you can assign pairs of dice with total value that matches exactly the rank of the card in order to overcome it. Undefeated enemies deal you damage and so do the locations that are in your path more then one turn due to fatigue. Unresolved events make you lose resources that you can gain when defeating enemies. You can also spend your resources to travel easier through locations. When you make it through the whole deck (there are no more cards in your path) and you have one of each type of resource you win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
