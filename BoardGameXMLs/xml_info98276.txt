			<description>From publisher's website :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Spring, 1876&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most formidable army ever assembled on the Great Plains begins to move. The army is comprised of three columns commanded by George Crook, John Gibbon, and Alfred H. Terry. The most renowned American officer of the era, George A. Custer, commands the 7th Cavalry Regiment, its 12 companies organized in 24 sections, its pack of mules and its Arikara scouts. Also on the move are the units of the 2nd and 3rd Cavalry regiments, Crow and Shoshone scouts, riflemen, volunteers, wagons, machine-guns, 19 superior officers and important figures, 108 combat sections, and 30 support units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of this is represented by more than 250 original illustrations in Hoka Hey!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a story of the Great Plains that takes a decisive turn. The great Indian tribes are included: Hunkpapas, Oglalas, Minneconjous, Sans Arc, Br&amp;ucirc;l&amp;eacute;s, Santee, Two Kettle, Yanktonnais, Cheyennes, Arapahos, Blackfeet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the call of Sitting Bull, a great charismatic chief, 24 tribal chiefs and heroes, including Gall, Crazy Horse, and Lame White Man, assembled 76 groups of warriors. To defend their tipis, their families and their ponies, their way of life and their freedom, they will fight! It&amp;rsquo;s a good day to die!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than 200 original drawings represent these Indian tribes who marched against the forces of the United States: Hoka Hey!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At Honsinger Bluff, on the banks of the Yellowstone River, the first engagement between Sitting Bull and Custer took place on 4 August 1873. A first meeting of the swords that foreshadowed the fighting to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On 9 June 1876, on the banks of the Tongue River, a skirmish showed Crook that the Indians were there and ready to fight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On 17 June 1876, the Indians won the first round by repulsing Crook&amp;rsquo;s column at the Rosebud River.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, near the Little Big Horn from 25-27 June 1876, the Sioux won their greatest victory. Yes, truly, for Custer and 263 of his men, this was a good day to die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This first module includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prelude to the Tragedy: The Battle of Honsinger Bluff, an A2 map and a historical scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crook is Repulsed: The Battle of Rosebud, two A2 maps and two scenarios (one of them historical).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Custer&amp;rsquo;s End: The Battle of the Little Big Horn, one to three A2 maps and 11 scenarios (three of them historical).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;June&amp;rsquo;s Victories: The June 1876 campaign, rules to link the battles of the Rosebud and Little Big Horn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last Warning: The Battle of the Tongue River, an A2 map and two scenarios. (This battle will be sent as a bonus for the first 500 orders.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Good Day to Die: three battles, 15 scenarios.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
