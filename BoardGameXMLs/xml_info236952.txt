			<description>In the same tradition of Apples to Apples and Cards Against Humanity there is a card game for the church generation. If you are a fan of satire, hyperbole, church cultural or making fun of things that take themselves too seriously you will find this game hilarious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's easy! 3-5 players can play at one time. One of them puts down a dilemma/question card and the other players have to answer it with their most sassy answer. The judge picks the funniest answer and everyone laughs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is written and created by a Jesus loving educational minister who wondered why his church friends couldn't have more irreverent fun at church culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
