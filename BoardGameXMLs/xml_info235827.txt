			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Herbs from on High!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you wish that alchemy in your game had a little more &amp;ldquo;oomph?&amp;rdquo; Have you ever been disappointed that no matter what it is that you&amp;rsquo;re trying to craft, all it takes is gold, time, and a skill check, with no concern as to what ingredients you&amp;rsquo;re using or how they&amp;rsquo;re prepared? Have you ever GM&amp;rsquo;d for a player who always seemed to want to wander off into the woods (or the merchant district) in search of rare and exotic reagents and compounds for his next magical experiment, and struggled to come up with an exciting and suitably fantastic material for him to find?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then this is the book for you. Successor to the critically-acclaimed A Necromancer&amp;rsquo;s Grimoire: The Secret of Herbs, Weekly Wonders: Mountain Herbs is a stand-alone product that continues its predecessors' unique approach to the sorts of low-cost special substances that can be created with the Craft (alchemy) skill. Presented herein are four new mountain-themed herbs with very special properties, as well as everything you need to know about how to use them in your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included are the hearty  grey moss, a plant which can both be used to combat altitude sickness and be made into a light glue ideal for aiding in climbing and balancing, the high spruce, a mountain tree whose needles can be brewed into teas that enhance a warrior&amp;rsquo;s abilities, or burned to create a wispy smoke that purifies the air, river shoots, thin, pointed reeds that can be fashioned into acidic darts, or consumed to grant the ability to breath water, and the sky flower, a mountain meadow blossom that can produce various effects making the user lighter than air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
