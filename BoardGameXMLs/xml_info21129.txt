							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Walt Disney&#039;s Disneyland Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The 1964 version has two different games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Disney character cards are numbered 1 to 10 with four cards of each suit.  However, the suits are red hearts, yellow sunbursts, blue five-pointed stars, and white daisy flowers.  There are also four Donald Duck cards of a &amp;quot;wild&amp;quot; shamrock suit.  The #1 cards are Mickey Mouse, the #2 cards are Minnie Mouse, the #3 cards are Pluto, the #4 cards are Thumper, the #5 cards are Goofy, the #6 cards are Dumbo, the #7 cards are Clarabelle, the #8 cards are Flower, the #9 cards are Daisy Duck, and the #10 cards are Chip 'n' Dale.  The last card is an instruction card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 1:  The four #1 cards are placed face-up on the table.  The remaining cards are shuffled and dealt to each player.  The player to the left of the dealer begins by playing a #2 card on a #1 card of the same color; this player can discard a second card by playing a #3 card of the same suit or any other #2 card.  A player can only discard up to two cards per turn. A Donald Duck card is to be played as an #11 card to complete a pile.  The first player to discard all his or her cards gains 10 points.  A player must gain 50 points to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 2:  The second game is similar to a version of Crazy Eights or Uno.  Each player is dealt five cards.  The remaining cards are placed in a face down stack with one card turn upright.  Players discard cards by matching either the suit or number or by playing a wild Donald Duck card.  When a wild Donald Duck card is discarded, it is played sideways so that the next player will have to match the card underneath by suit or number or with another wild Donald Duck card.  The winner is the first player to discard all of his cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
