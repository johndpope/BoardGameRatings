			<description>In Alien Entity: Mutated, you play as a group of astronauts trying to escape a sabotaged medical ship. An unknown member of the team has been mutated by an alien entity and will sabotage and mutate the researchers as they try and repair the satellite array to contact mission control. Will you survive? Are your friends mutated by an alien entity? Can you contact mission control before it&amp;rsquo;s too late? Grab some friends and join the paranoia!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alien Entity is meant to be played multiple times. Players are passed cards face down to determine who is playing as a human or an alien. The humans win if the satellite array is built, they escape on the escape pod or the alien gets shot. The alien wins if it passes out mutation cards to all of the humans. After each game ends players may be eligible to open up legacy style expansion packs depending on the outcome of each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player draws cards from a central pile and takes turns playing and passing cards. Choose wisely because you will only be able to play one action and one battery card per turn. You may pass cards face down to other players to either help them or hurt their progress. If you are a human you may want to pass parts of the satellite array to another human. If you are an alien you can pass mutation cards to other players to get them on your side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games usually last between ten to twenty minutes. Once certain requirements are met new card packs are opened and introduced into the game altering the game play. The new cards give players alternate weapons and equipment to make every play through unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
