			<description>Snitch is a standalone card game with social deduction and semi co-operative mechanics where players try to win the most money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round one player selects the number of cards (characters) that must then be matched from the groups' cards (characters)- these are drawn from the deck and the players negotiate which cards (characters) they will contribute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player contributes one card towards the pattern. If the players collectively complete the required pattern, everyone wins - if not, the group loses. Winners gain loot, the losers gain nothing - with the amount of loot determined by the number of cards matched. After 8 rounds, the winner is the player with the most loot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's always a chance though that one player was the Snitch - trying to make the group fail in order to win by themselves! The Snitch causes others to miss out on the loot, and steals some of their existing loot. Being the snitch at the right time is key to winning the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have a limited number of Snitch cards - when will you Snitch on your friends? When will they Snitch on you?! Everyone has to Snitch at some point...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
