			<description>Talismanoj is a 2-player card game (with cards and rules in Esperanto) in which each player draws from their own deck and plays cards to create two sets of 3 cards (each set must share a common attribute but have different colors) and a legend card, while surviving attacks by the opponent which can remove their previously played cards. Combat is resolved by playing cards from one's battle reserve (where the cards must have been previously placed in anticipation).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2 player decks have different themes and art: one deck has a &amp;quot;Don Quixote&amp;quot; theme (with Gustave Dor&amp;eacute; art) and the other deck has various Esperanto authors (&amp;quot;Verdaj Donkiĥotoj&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With multiple sets, it is possible to play with more than 2 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
