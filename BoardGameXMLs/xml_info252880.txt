			<description>Embargo is a 2-6 player competitive game where players run their own logistics company and are in competition to complete as many contracts as possible while sabotaging each other's operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is represented with a player board, there they can hold freight at their warehouse, accept and fulfill contracts and hold a contract or sabotage card of their choice in reserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the middle of the table is the Transport Hub containing red, blue, black, green, yellow and white cubes. This represents freight for the different industries and contracts available in the contract deck. There is a contracts deck of cards and a sabotage deck of cards. Players use an action-checklist to take pick up contracts, sabotage cards, and move freight from the hub to the warehouse and contracts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To fulfill a contract, players must place that much of the required freight colour onto the corresponding contract on their control board. Each contract has a certain number of victory points attached to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player that reaches 25 victory points first wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
