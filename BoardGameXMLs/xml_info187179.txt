			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Primal Edge Quick Start is a substantial simplification of the D20 system, stripping the system of almost everything except the core mechanic.  Characters have Hit Points as the only actual numeric statistic.  Characters may also have abilities or skills but these appear abstracted (some examples assume they have a numeric value).  Everything else in D20 is removed.  Action Resolution (including combat) compared a D20 roll to a Difficulty target.  The Game Master may sometimes (but need not) provide a modifier to the die roll if the character has a relevant ability or skill.  The Game Master sets the Difficulty numeric range based on a narrative description of the difficulty of the action (Trivial, Mediocre, Below Average, Average, Above Average, Extraordinary, and God-like).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is abstracted into &amp;quot;pseudo-chronologically&amp;quot; rounds (e.g., it supports initiative order) but otherwise works like any other action resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generally speaking, the game is not complete enough for actual use without an experienced Game Master.  A planned rules expansion was never released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
