							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mahjong Titans</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mahjong Titans is a computer solitaire of mahjong which was included in Windows Vista and later Windows releases as part of their games suite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player may choose between 6 layouts - Cat, Turtle, Crab, Dragon, Fortress and Spider. There are various graphic choices, to fit individual preferences.  The game is useful as a simple puzzle, but has been made not totally random to prevent complete shutouts.  The game gives some of the enjoyment of classic Mahjong without the need to own the game, however, it cannot be played competitively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
