			<description>This game was in The Children's Book of Games, Puzzles and Pastimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules:&lt;br/&gt;This is an exciting game played with one pack of cards and a piece of paper with the &amp;ldquo;pitch&amp;rdquo; as shown. You can use a coin, counter or button for the ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place the ball in the centre and the pack face downwards at the side of the table. One player begins by turning the top card face up on to the table, and then moves the ball according to the following rules, with the object of moving it into the opposite goal.&lt;br/&gt;If the card is a red one, then the red player moves, and the black player moves if the card is a black one. For odd numbers move the ball one square in any direction; for even numbers move the ball two squares in any direction, including a &amp;ldquo;bent&amp;rdquo; move, which is one sideways and one forward. If it is a court card, move the ball one square sideways, either way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a goal is scored, replace the ball in the centre and continue play until the end of the pack is reached, when you can shuffle them and replace face down&amp;not;wards on the table and continue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first to score a number of goals previously decided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
