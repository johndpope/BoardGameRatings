							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Orator</name>
									
			<description>The object of Orator is to deliver the best orations on a variety of topics without making any blunders within a two minute time limit. Players attempt to avoid blunders commonly made in spoken English today, such as, 'umm', 'aah', 'err' etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may resort to bluffing to complete their talk however successful detection of bluffing and making of blunders incurs penalties. The player who is given the highest score by the other players (the audience) wins the round. The winner of Orator is the player with the best overall score for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
