			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 40 x 40 inch, full color battlemap of a Medieval Camp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps (VTT) and include a 360 degree view of the inside of the Medieval Camp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well let&amp;rsquo;s see if this batch of pages has what it takes to be squires or knights someday.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Knight Training Instructor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medieval Camp is a single map of a small training camp surrounded by a wooden palisade with four corner towers. Medieval Camp includes a 360-degree panoramic view from the center of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medieval Camp is intended for use in fantasy or medieval games. Medieval Camp can be an excellent training base for starting Player Characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trial by Fire: By day the pages train in the courtyard with weapon, armor, and shield training and horse riding. At night they stay up and guard the towers with the night watch, learning how to remain awake even when exhausted after a long day of combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A rival noble sends his knights to attack the medieval camp as part of an all-out attack on his rival&amp;rsquo;s fiefdom in a takeover bid. They set fire to the palisade and the young pages are forced to fight in real combat for the first time. Adult Players can take the part of the Knight Training Instructors with Kid Players taking the part of the young pages. Goals are to put out the fires and to defeat the rival knights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
