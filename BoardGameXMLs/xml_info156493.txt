			<description>From the back of the English/European PS2 case:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the semi-final of the championships, you're facing match point against a formidable opponent ranked 42 places higher than you. You've already faulted on your first serve and you are staring defeat in the face. You've got to conjure up a big serve from somewhere to put your opponent on the back foot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In screams the serve, it's very wide, it kicks off the hard surface and is causing your opponent to stretch to make up the ground.&lt;br/&gt;Off balance, your opponent returns a weak topspin shot right in to your path as you scream towards the net to close the angle.&lt;br/&gt;You meet the return with a sweet backhand volley that heads towards the base line as your opponent scurries across to make up the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The volley is a good one as the ball bounces a few inches inside the base line as your opponent tries in vain to make up the ground.&lt;br/&gt;Match point saved and the pressure's off, but for how long? Have you got what it takes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     32 photo realistic players each with their own style and skills&lt;br/&gt;     16 stunningly detailed tennis stadiums in locations across the globe featuring grass, clay, hard and carpet courts&lt;br/&gt;     Tournament mode - team with a partner and compete against 14 of the world's greatest tennis playing countries&lt;br/&gt;     Multiplayer mode - fast and furious tennis with up to 4 game players in single match mode and 2 players can compete together in tournament mode&lt;br/&gt;     Player editor - become a character in the game and create your own dream partner&lt;br/&gt;     Motion captured animation provides lifelike movement and an ultra real tennis experience&lt;br/&gt;     Tennis consultancy provided coaches to Jennifer Capriati, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario and Tim Henman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
