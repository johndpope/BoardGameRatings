			<description>the WEIGHTing GAME is a two-player strategy game where players move plastic pieces (weights) inside slots on a bar that resembles a see-saw. The game begins with 7 weights in 4 different colors with each colored weight having a specific placement location. &lt;br/&gt;Each player has 4 options during their turn:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Move black to any position&lt;br/&gt;     Move one colored weight to a matching color location&lt;br/&gt;     Remove and hold a weight (except black)&lt;br/&gt;     Replace any number of colored weights to their matching start positions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal is to have the bar balance while holding no weights at the end of your turn. &lt;br/&gt;The game is a blend of light strategy and physics, but an experienced player might be able to memorize enough moves/counter-moves to game the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
