							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Peppa Pig Fairground Game</name>
									
			<description>Peppa Pig Fairground Ride Game is fun and exciting 3D game of musical air-swings &amp;ndash; but with a fun and exciting twist for young children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins when each player chooses their Peppa Pig character to play with, and places it on a seat on the fairground ride. The youngest player begins by pressing down on the red button top and everyone watches the air swings spin round and around and listening to the fun musical tune that will be playing. The aim of the game is to be the last player sat on the air swings &amp;ndash; but if you Peppa Pig figurine lands next to a red &amp;lsquo;Hop Off&amp;rsquo; space, then they must hop off the ride and try to guess where the empty seat will land next. Did you guess it right? If not, don&amp;rsquo;t worry, you have until the winner is left on the swings to hop back on the ride.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
