			<description>[From the manual.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Heroine is back and this time she's not alone, in a new arcade-action game.&lt;br/&gt;Caught once more in the strange, unfathomable games of the gods, Athena has been whisked through time and space to a bizarre alternative reality where humanity is in thrall to a race of demons, each more fearsome than the last. The few survivors who resist their unearthly over-lords look to her for guidance and redemption and once again the mantle of saviour has been placed upon of her.&lt;br/&gt;Steeling herself against the unknown terrors that await she seeks an answer within herself and then a voice, cold and clear like a bell tells her that all power is hers. The force of truth and justice a weapon in her hands to smite her assailants and crush their evil hearts.&lt;br/&gt;Awaking as if from dream, she arises and steps out into the war-torn world into which she has been thrust. Her eyes grow hard as somewhere a scream tears the silence and strikes a cold hard echo in her warrior's heart.&lt;br/&gt;Her stride, long and languid carries her into the shadows, there her fate is awaiting; perhaps her death.&lt;br/&gt;Join Athena in her quest as she cuts a bloody swathe down through the demon-infested hell of an oppressed world to her ultimate confrontation with the vile despot at the worlds dark core.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
