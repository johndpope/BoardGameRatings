			<description>Elemental Clash HEX gives you the &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; Elemental Clash CCG experience - gone HEX!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elemental Clash HEX is a hex-tile-based, fully customizable fantasy game for 2 - 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to run your opponent out of tiles in their magical bag of hex tiles (this serves as the equivalent of a deck in a regular, card based CCG) before they can do so to you. For each damage a player takes, that player discards a random hex from their magical bag. If a player is required to draw a hex from the bag and cannot do so, they lose immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While emulating many key mechanics of the original Elemental Clash Customizable Card Game, such as deck depletion as the win condition and the beloved-by-many &amp;quot;Boon&amp;quot; mechanic, Elemental Clash HEX is a whole new experience and twist on the original game, as many mechanics are new, fresh and unique, taking advantage of what the medium hex-tiles can offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, the game features stunning artwork by a talented cast of international artists, elevating the game on state-of-the-art level when it comes to visuals as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
