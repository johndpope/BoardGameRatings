			<description>designer's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;With description of 50 gemstones and the many reasons to start including them on your equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book allows for a new level of customisation of items for high fantasy games. The mechanics are straightforward and fit perfectly into your dungeon crawling, dragon slaying Saturday evenings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;For many years, players have sought after varied and unique treasure. Their characters have ventured through numerous tunnels, fought all variety of beasts , and overcame every challenge. Sometimes, they found riches. Occasionally, they found greater and more powerful weapons, armor, and tomes. Often, they were left with the option to leave trinkets behind and sell what they could carry. This guide to socketing weapons, armor, and gear provides a new option for characters that fall under the OSRIC series of games. Within this work, we will provide the basic rules to enhance existing gear with the gems characters may find in their travels, if the GM permits it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
