			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since their inception, Scott Adams' Adventures have been a mainstay in the libraries of computer owners. Now, the company that brought you these great programs brings you the fantasy-adventure games of other authors in this NEW series. Each program reflects many months and sometimes years of development by their respective authors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Jyym Pearson, author of Zossed in Space and Curse of Crowley Manor, now comes a poweful new contender in the popular Other Venture Series: Escape From Traam!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your small space cruiser is in trouble - and even though you survived the initial crash on a bizarre distant world, you may soon wish that you hadn't! The alien environment of Traam is replete with incredible wonders and sights which no human eyes have ever beheld. You must escape this dangerous world; but be forewarned that if your decisions are not tempered with intellegence and caution, you may not see home again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Escape From Traam, as in the rest of the Other Venture series, you manipulate your alter-ego through your computer using brief sentances. Through your micro, you are able to journey through awesome worlds armed only with your wits and wisdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
