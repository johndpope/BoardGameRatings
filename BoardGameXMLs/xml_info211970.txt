			<description>Orwell is a new governmental security program that has the power to survey the online presence of citizens and access their personal communication and technology devices. But to successfully profile suspects and protect the privacy of citizens, Orwell needs an impartial human researcher&amp;mdash;someone operating outside of the Nation who can interpret relevant chunks of data and make decisions when conflicts arise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Selected from thousands of candidates, you have been chosen as Orwell&amp;rsquo;s first human researcher. And when a terror attack rocks the Nation&amp;rsquo;s capital city of Bonton, Orwell is immediately put to the test.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Required to investigate the web pages, blog posts, chat messages, files and private information that Orwell retrieves and serves up, you will help the Nation create personal profiles of suspects and uncover the perpetrators. But are these people really terrorists? What does the information you reveal to Orwell say about them? What if you find out things about them that not even their loved ones know? What is the real price of maintaining the security that the Nation is yearning for?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer's Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
