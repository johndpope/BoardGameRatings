			<description>In Tiny Cloud, players are faeries who try to control a cloud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fast dexterity game is quite simple:&lt;br/&gt;-The cloud is in the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;-Each player has 10 tokens (faeries).&lt;br/&gt;-They will try to control the cloud by throwing their tokens on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game (when all the tokens have been thrown), each faerie on the cloud will give one point to his owner. The player with most points is the winner of the game. If there is a draw, the two players win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
