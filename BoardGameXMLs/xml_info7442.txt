			<description>Following a violent storm, certain marine birds became lost and disorientated: the aim of the game is to find the lost birds and re-group them. The game aims to improve children&amp;rsquo;s awareness of marine wildlife preservation, while keeping children surprised and amused by the original and innovative idea of the game, including an element of co-operation between players. Information cards are included for each of the eight marine birds used in the game, these have been made with the help of the LPO (Ligue Protectrice des Oiseaux). Three imaginary birds are also included in the game, leaving room for imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
