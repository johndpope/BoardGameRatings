			<description>A Little Card Game for 2-5 Players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a particularly thorough round of assassinations in the capitol, the Monarch and the entire royal family are dead. &lt;br/&gt;You are one of several despotic aristocrats in the tiny village of Lionsgate. You've heard some troubling rumors that the person next in line for the throne is a commoner from your village. This could prove problematic, since you've never been much of a friend of commoners. You lose sleep at night imagining your comeuppance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of a round of Village Royalty, one card is hidden away. This is the Monarch. At the end of the round, any villagers from the same guild as the Monarch are worth twice as many points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each player's turn, they first add a villager card from their hand to the Market in the middle of the table. They then have a chance to bribe a villager, either from the market, or from another player, for one more coin than the villager already holds. After bribing a villager, the player can use the villager's action, which might earn them more coins, points, or some other advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until a player either has no cards or no coins. The Monarch is revealed, and points are counted. Continue playing rounds until someone reaches 20 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
