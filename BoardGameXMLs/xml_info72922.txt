			<description>&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adventurer presents an optional character class for Labyrinth Lord and Swords &amp; Wizardry. The basic idea is to have a class for players who rolled low attributes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Not again! The best attribute you have rolled at character creation is a 13 in charisma and your Labyrinth Lord won't let you change the order of your ability scores! And with this 7 in strength the char won't survive long.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement presents the ultimate answer. The adventurer class is THE class for all your characters with low ability scores. Probably the adventurer is the only class in the Labyrinth Lord game with no minimum attribute scores required. No, there are maximum scores for the most important scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To compensate for these low scores, the adventurer class has access to some magic spells, some healing powers and even some thieving skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At level 9 the adventurer can build his or her own inn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
