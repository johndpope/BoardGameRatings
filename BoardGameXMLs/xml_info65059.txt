			<description>The game contains&lt;br/&gt;  1 main board&lt;br/&gt;  81 black cardboard pieces (digits from 1 to 9)&lt;br/&gt;  4 sets of 81 cardboard pieces (each set in different&lt;br/&gt;    colour red, green, yellow and blue)&lt;br/&gt;  1 booklet with tasks&lt;br/&gt;  1 hourglass&lt;br/&gt;  1 instruction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Payers choose the task they are going to solve from the task booklet. They place black cardboard pieces according to the model from the booklet. Next each player chooses the colour of the cardboards pieces he is going to use on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The oldest player starts the game. then other player follow clockwise. The player whose turn this is places the cardboard piece he is holding in his hand on an empty square. He/she must apply to the SUDOKU rule that inat inside each row, each column and each block a digit may appear only once. When the first player made his/her move, the next player places his/her cardboard piece on the board - of course, remembering about sudoku rule. The hourglass limits the length of turn. If the hourglass becomes empty and the player has not placed his/her cardboard piece yet, he/she misses his/her chance and it is the next [;ayer's turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game stops when no player can place a cardboard piece on the board.&lt;br/&gt;then the players check the position of the cardboard pieces on the board in the answer booklet. If on the board there is misplaced cardboard piece, we put them aside and each player counts his/her cardboard pieces that are on the board. The winner is the person who scores the biggest number of points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
