							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grand Fleets: Third Edition Rulebook</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grand Fleets is a tabletop game of naval warfare during the age of the battleship. From the ironclads of the late 1800s to the floating fortresses of World War II, players can take command of the ships that altered the course of history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the basic rules for surface actions between 1890 and 1950, Grand Fleets includes rules for using submarines and aircraft alongside your battlewagons. Advanced rules are also provided for things like RADAR, smoke screens, critical hits, fleet morale, night fighting, and destroyer flotillas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All distances in Grand Fleets are given in thousands of yards (kyds), giving you the flexibility to adapt the tabletop scale to whatever size miniatures you have on hand. The rules are also written to accommodate hex-based play, if desired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook contains 160 ship data cards representing over 50 different classes. Best of all, you'll never have to wait for official publication of your favorite ships: comprehensive, step by step guidelines are provided to generate game stats for any vessel that put to sea during the battleship era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, raise the battle ensign, sound general quarters, and damn the torpedoes &amp;mdash; your destiny awaits!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grand Fleets: Third Edition Rulebook is a set of naval miniatures rules that can be used for ships from 1:1800 to 1:6000 scale.  The system can be played on a tabletop or hexes.  Certain aspects of the system have been streamlined for the third edition, such as separate gun mount arcs have been combined and armor piercing values have been reduced from three to one.  The rules can be used to simulate naval battles from the Spanish-American War era to WWII.  The main rulebook includes scenarios from the Russo-Japanese War, WWI, the Spanish Civil War, and WWII,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
