			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traverse the vast continents of Asia and Oceania!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel down the ancient Silk Road and visit the many cities in Asia and Oceania.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives one Destination card to determine their starting position, or hometown. Another 15 Destination cards are then dealt to each player. The goal is to plan a round trip from your hometown via the 15 destinations. The first person to complete a round trip wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To aid the traveler, airports and harbors are available as a quick travel option if a player has a corresponding Compass card. The Compass cards can help or stall your trip in a number of ways, including changing the outcome of the game. A comfortable lead can change into a frenzied contest!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for 2-4 players and takes you on a different path around the continents each round!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
