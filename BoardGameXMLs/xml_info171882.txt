							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">47 Villainous Cults, Orders and Guilds to Thwart Your Heroes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weary from their long journey back home, our heroes stopped at the threshold of Old Hogge&amp;rsquo;s Tavern at the edge of town. Climbing the rickety old porch, they spotted the now-too familiar sigil of the Cult of the Eternal Flame carved deeply upon the tavern&amp;rsquo;s door. Though it was not the first time they had seen the red sigil, it was its presence here on the door of their beloved old stomping ground &amp;ndash; the very tavern that brought them together those many years ago &amp;ndash; that gave them pause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cult had only grown in number since the end of the war, and now it seemed to be everywhere. Its temples were growing in number, and everywhere the great, ever-burning fires could be seen towering above the city walls...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this guide you will find 47 Cults, Secret Orders, Thieves' Guilds, Trades Guilds, and Other organizations to use in your campaign worlds. Each order is described in detail, from its history to its aims and relative strength. Feel free to use these villainous groups in your next - or even current - campaign, and as always, enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
