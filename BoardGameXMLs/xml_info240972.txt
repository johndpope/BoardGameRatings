			<description>World Champion Counter Europe Champion: Each player has 1 pawn (boxer) which he moves about the board. Movement is determined by a die. The World Champion begins casting, and then dicing is alternately done. The pips mark the steps that the boxers coming from their respective ring corners, take on the marked way towards each other to come to blows. If the attacker lands on the space occupied by his opponent, it means that he landed him an effective blow and scores a point. The fight lasts 3 rounds or til one boxer is knocked out. Winner of a round will be who has first scored 5 hits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
