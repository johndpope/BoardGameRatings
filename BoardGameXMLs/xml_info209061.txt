							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Discovery of the Tomb of Mogrelden</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mogrelden was once an evil priestess; several hundred years ago, she was buried in a tomb and anyone that knew of her tombs whereabouts was slaughtered.  Those that did the killing knew not where the tomb was; all they knew was that they were to kill all the workmen and leave none alive. In this adventure it so happens that the characters accidentally stumble across her tomb without knowing it at first. The characters are caught in a violent thunderstorm and are drenched almost immediately and seeking shelter see a small cave and this is were the adventure begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 1st - 2nd level characters.  This scenario typically is distributed in a ZIP archive including the 5-page RTF scenario, and 1-page RTF monster supplement, and a single GIF file (map).  The author uses... unusual... grammar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
