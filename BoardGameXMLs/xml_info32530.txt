							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bugs Bunny Adventure Game</name>
									
			<description>Bugs Bunny has invited his some of his friends to go with him to his Carrot Castle. Along the path he has stationed more of his friends to show the way. Some of them help while others turn mischievous and try to hinder the players as they go along.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bugs Bunny Adventure Game is a classic 50s Role and Move Game with various locations that send you forward/back or gain/lose you a turn. The interesting twist was that each player had to get both of their 'Warner Brothers' Cartoon Characters home to win and that meant that a player could think carefully move their characters in order to increase the chance of hitting good spots and limit the risk of bad spots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Game Box Insert &amp;amp; User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Listed in American Games, #4531a/4532.  1950s/1961, Cartoons, Board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
