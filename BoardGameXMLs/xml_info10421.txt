			<description>Players race to be the first to New City while simultaneously trying to run their opponents off of the road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player initially receives a hand of five cards. On their turn, players play a card then draw a card from either the draw pile or the top of the discard pile. They move on the track by playing mileage cards on their play pile. Mileage cards are numbered from one to four and come in four colors but may only be added to the play pile if they match the previous mileage card in either number or color. Players must put a card on the discard pile if they are unable to play but they they also have the option of playing obstacle cards on other players' play piles. These can be avoided by playing ambulance cards, green lights, and tow trucks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to reach the tenth space at the end of the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
