			<description>This is the First in the Pages of War Series of Card Games: M.O.D.E (Men, Orcs, Dragkins, Elves)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pages of War: M.O.D.E is a richly strategic game with simple mechanics and a unique flavour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You take on the role of a bard of 1 of the 4 races in the western lands of the continent of Murghingale: MEN of the Blue Mountain, ORCS of the Black Hills, DRAGKINS of the Cloudy Peaks, and ELVES of the Verdant-Wood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a bard of one of these races your goal is to tell the greatest tale of its glory and strength by reciting the rhymes and songs of history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BASICS:&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a deck (Historia) of 30 cards containing 22 heroes of 3 of the 5 suits (Axe, Bow, Sword, Lance, and Winged), 3 Jacks (generals of their 3 suits), 3 Aces (special tactics) and 2 monarchs (King and Queen).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Goal is to create chapters (groups of heroes) that are strong enough to find the other players' Kings and Queens and destroy them - defeating other players' chapters and collecting their cards as spoils of war as you battle to achieve victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player's King and Queen are destroyed they are eliminated from the battle to win but can turn the tide of combat with their remaining cards by adding their heroes to the chapters of other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
