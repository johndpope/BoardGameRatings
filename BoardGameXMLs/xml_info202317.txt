							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Haunted Cave</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a cave at the base of a tall cliff several hours inland from the shore lies the treasure of a once famous pirate, Martyn Whiteskull. The exact location of the treasure is unknown but whenever a piece washes down the river to the village of Frokow, Martyn&amp;rsquo;s ghost appears to torment those in possession of it. In addition to being haunted by Martyn&amp;rsquo;s ghost, the cave is now the den of a pack of wolves that have lived there for decades and don&amp;rsquo;t like intruders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Born the son of a successful merchant family, Martyn Karnak suffered from partial albinism that left the skin on his face and neck a pale white and his eyes read. This combined with the lack of hair on his body gave him an appearance that did not work well in the merchant community. Leaving that life, he eventually ended up a pirate where he was known as Martyn Whiteskull. Moderately successful, he lost his life in the process of hiding a portion of his treasure and his ghost haunts the treasure to this day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
