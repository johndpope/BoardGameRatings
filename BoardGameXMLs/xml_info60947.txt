			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It doesn't take a lot of skill to recognize that a gold statue or a gem encrusted vest has value.  But to the keen eye, that pile of bones and pottery in the corner may be worth even more.  Unseen Treasures offers you twenty mundane items to add to treasure collections or launch adventures.  This non-system specific product will provide plenty of ideas and story seeds for your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each item is presented with its raw (untrained evaluation) value and true value.  Many of the items also include background legends and lore than can add an element of mystery.  Does a God Skull really let you converse with the dead, or is it just a creepy relic from a forgotten culture?  What really happens when all of the Fighting Ducks of Pactua are gathered in one place?  Can you really brew a love potion in a Kissing Fish Teapot?  That is entirely up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the items, this product also includes brief background information on five organizations that could serve as patrons, customers, or enemies for treasure hunters.  Plus, five tools of the trade no self-respecting treasure hunter would want to be without.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
