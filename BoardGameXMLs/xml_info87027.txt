							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Walkers in the Witchery Way</name>
									
			<description>User Summary: Game Chef 2010 Design Competition Submission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;You are a Skinwalker. Why is up to you- maybe you were raised by Skinwalkers out in the desert, say by a small tribe or a lone Skinwalker. Maybe you were born into an ordinary family in the City and you discovered the secret in the catacomb-libraries there, or have known instinctually since birth, or were taught the art by a Skinwalker you once knew. Whatever the reason, you have the ability to steal the shape from others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What the journey is should be up to its players and GM, but there are three main stories. One, the story of those who adhere to the City going out into the desert to hunt the demons there. Two, the story of those who adhere to the desert, sneaking into the City in an attempt to sabotage their efforts and to destroy them if they can. Three, the story of the journey outward to escape both places and to discover the Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
