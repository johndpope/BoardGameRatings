She is the perfect companion to characters relying upon sneak attack and cooperative tactics!  Add this charismatic warrior with her razor wit and even keener blades to your party today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is Pathfinder&amp;reg; Roleplaying Game compatible and gives you twenty ready-to-play stat blocks for a stalwart companion at all levels, 1 thru 20!  Use these stat blocks to add companions or assistants to the party when players are absent, extra muscle is needed, or mercenaries are hired.  This also gives the GM the ability to have potential cohorts on hand built at any level needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you find the character&amp;rsquo;s history and other story elements not to your liking, you still have twenty NPC stat blocks you can use as standalone characters of your own naming and developing or as minions and other rabble.

Each release provides numerous stat blocks that can be used immediately along a specific theme.  Locate a specific kind of foe to introduce into your campaign or collect them all to build a toolbox of NPCs to unleash at any time.  Give your players a new ally today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
