			<description>Numa is an abstract strategy game in which players use simultaneous movement to try to get pieces adjacent to each other on an 8x8 board. The pieces are in four shapes (triangle, square, circle, and pentagon) and have an Arabic number on one side and a Roman numeral on the other. Movement is done by revealing a colored stone that indicates the direction that the chosen piece will move in. If the adjacent pieces are showing the same number style on their face-up side, they score the total value of the showing numbers. One player scores points for Arabic number matches and the other for the Roman Numeral matches. The first player to 30 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
