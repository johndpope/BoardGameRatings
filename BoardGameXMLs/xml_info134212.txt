			<description>Lizzy Rockwell&amp;rsquo;s charming fairy tale characters, locations, and iconic objects can be arranged and rearranged to create logical and/or hilarious tales. Kids will build critical thinking skills when they devise a way to incorporate a fire-breathing dragon and a flask of magic potion into their tale of a clever boot-wearing cat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck of cards consist of cards of 3 categories: characters, settings, and objects. Instructions with the game offer a variety of gameplay options. One of these is that the players start with exactly 4 cards in their hand. In turn, they choose from the face-down stack. Keep one and discard one they do not want... play continues until someone has 2 characters, a setting and an object. This player is &amp;quot;winner&amp;quot; and for reward gets to tell a story using the cards in hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: Be the first with the correct combination of cards in hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
