							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The NC Combat System</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NC Combat System is intended to be a modular replacement for the combat system utilized in the standard Advanced Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons rules.  The system is completely different and novel.  Characters have additional Attributes to support the system, including Offense Ability, Defense Ability, Armor Value, and Damage Reduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hit Points are not much improved by Class and Level, but represent size and toughness.  They also are &amp;quot;scaled up&amp;quot; so that a human character will have around 60 (average) to 100 (robust) hit points.  Weapons cause ten times the damage as previously (e.g., a longsword does 10-80 points of damage).  Rest and recovery are much, much slower than previously.  Combat supports critical hits and saving rolls.  The amount of time in a combat round is adjusted and various actions are specified in terms of segments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generally speaking, the combat in The NC Combat System is more complex than that in the AD&amp;amp;D system but also is much more consistent in approach.  The intent of the system was to simplify operation, shorten play time, and present a more &amp;quot;realistic&amp;quot; combat action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
