			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who IS Lady Wonderra?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She seems to exist in three different times, and in each of them, she offers Victory for a price.  In the Fantasy Era, she is known as Lady Wonderra.  In the Near-Modern Era, she is Cindy Wonderra, Miss Wonderra or &amp;quot;The Hookup.&amp;quot;  In the Space Era, she is Phane Wonderra.  She has the best equipment that can be found, and always seems to know what an adventurer needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who is she?  Are there three Wonderras or, more amazingly, merely one?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've asked these questions through twelve issues of Victory's Vault.  Now, it's time for some answers.  Meet the true Lady Wonderra, discover how she does what she does where and when she does, and dare to ask if she can help out YOUR Victory System Campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
