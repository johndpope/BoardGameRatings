			<description>A collection of three abstract strategy games that all play on the same board.  The board and pieces are designed to stay put, so that the games can be played while traveling.  The three games are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tandu - Each player places their opponent's numbered tiles (1 - 14) face-down on the board.  They then take turns turning over one tile at a time.  If it is the correct tile in sequence (starting with 1), it is placed on the outside edge of the board.  The first player to place all 14 of their tiles wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hannibal - Each player tries to capture their opponent's king by placing blocks around it.  The first to succeed wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nile - Try to be the first player to place four of their pyramids in a row, while blocking the other player from doing so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
