							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ad-Man! a Game of Advertising Mascots</name>
									
			<description>Ad-Man! is a card game about advertising mascots. Playing the role of an advertising executive, players use original mascots to win product accounts to sell things like soda pop, baseball teams, and fabric detergent. The winner of the game has collected the most products. Different mascot types (like a dog, a cowboy, or silverware) are not restricted to selling just one thing. A snowman, for example, has been used to sell apples, dishwashing soap flakes, and the city of North Saint Paul, Minnesota.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 60 core mascot cards, 20 expansion mascot cards, 31 product cards, 8 trump cards, rules, and 4 blank cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(The following is an abbreviated rules set. The full set of rules can be found on my website)&lt;br/&gt;Product cards have a symbol, and only mascots with that same symbol are of use in winning the account for that product. Mascot cards have three symbols, each with a numerical value. Players take turns playing mascots with the appropriate symbol, vying to have the highest accumulated number value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player has put any card into play during the round, at the conclusion they draw 1 fresh Mascot card. Players have the option to pass play at the beginning of a round, and may draw 2 Mascot cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information can be found at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.steverobbinsgames.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.steverobbinsgames.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
