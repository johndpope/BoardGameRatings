			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After leaving a successful venture on Xodus Island you find yourselves being pursued by Captain Gabriel Angel and his pirates! Your escape sends both ships into a hurricane causing you to become lost at sea with waves threatening your ship. Choking on water the next morning you and your fellow adventurers find yourselves at Shipwreck Cove!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 5th Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for mid-level adventurers and DM.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was offered at Gen Con 2015 and seemed to be a big hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
