			<description>K&amp;ouml;bes is a board game for two to four players from 12 years of age. The game is played in the dining room of a typical Cologne brewery/pub. Players assume the role of K&amp;ouml;bes, a waiter who serves K&amp;ouml;lsch (name used to describe beer in Cologne and Bonn). Each K&amp;ouml;bes is his own entrepreneur. He must bring as many K&amp;ouml;lsch as possible to the tables of his guests, that he previously purchased at the bar from the host brewer. But it's not as simple as it sounds, as there are always many obstacles in the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game bases its mechanics on the well known and loved game Mensch &amp;Auml;rger Dich Nicht, which uses dice to move around the board. In K&amp;ouml;bes, players also use dice rolls to advance their K&amp;ouml;bes around the brewery/pub, but are not limited to just the rolled dice numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
