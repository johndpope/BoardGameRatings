							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Pair: An Official Fellowship Expansion</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Listen, we heard you needed experts. The best of the best. Top o' the line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And that's why they sent me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's why they sent us, you clod. Just leave the talkin' to me, okay?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sure sure. So long as you leave the fightin', the cookin', the liftin', the explorin', and pretty much everything else to me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Okay okay, cool it. Where was I? Ah right. So there's this Overlord bothering you, yeah? So long as we get paid, we'll help take care of 'em.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yeah, no sweat. So what if they've got a massive army? So what if they're all unstoppable and stuff? We'll handle it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You bet we will. We're quite the Pair, don'tcha think? So, do we gotta deal?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pair is the sixth Fellowship expansion pack, and the second Powerful Playbook, after The Giant. The Pair are not champions of a people, but of the concept of teamwork. They  come from a clan of heroes, bounty hunters, or mercenaries, making their own way in the world regardless of where they came from. They can accomplish more together than anyone could ever accomplish alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the Pair comes with an immediate and obvious benefit - you can be in two places at once, and playing as two (or three) characters lets you set up and get away with things that single characters never could on their own. You bring your own teamwork, all by yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
