							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Duck Pins</name>
									
			<description>Duck Pins is a bowling game that was created by J Pressman early in the 1900's. Duck pin bowling is a game that is played in the state of Rhode Island and is somewhat similar to the Candlepin Bowling that is done in the Northeast, especially Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Each frame consists of 3 balls and not just two. Unlike Candlepin bowling where the fallen pins stay on the lane as &amp;quot;deadwood&amp;quot; which can be used to help or hinder a second or third shot, in Duck Pins the pins are cleared from the lane before the next shot is taken. One can score a STRIKE, a SPARE or a TEN (3 balls to knock all the pins down!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
