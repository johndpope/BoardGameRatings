							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Texas Hold&#039;em StrataCards</name>
									
			<description>StrataCards is a unique set of playing cards that let you play poker like a game of solitaire or with a group. Each deck contains 52 cards and 2 &amp;quot;jokers&amp;quot;, but instead of typical front and back faces, each side has multiple card faces printed on it. For this Texas Hold'em deck, the fronts show 2 card faces, and the backs show 3 card faces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The front of each card represents your two hole cards, and their value relative to other starting hands. There are also example flops labeled &amp;quot;Weak&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Good&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Great&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;The Nuts&amp;quot;, and their value relative to other possible flops. Text descriptions include a standard name and a popular nickname for the hole cards, and the common slang for your made hands and draws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The back of each card represents three cards that would be a great flop for the starting hand on the front. The idea is that without looking at the front of the card, you can deduce a range of hole cards that might be on the front just by looking at the flop cards on the back. Turn and River cards are displayed by placing one card under another so that only one new card face is showing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This connection between the cards on the front and back lets you play and learn the game by yourself, or practice your hand reading skills in a game with others. Key points of the system are: starting hands and their values before and after the flop, learning the lingo that the professionals use to describe their hands, and good practice spotting bad beats, missed draws, pure bluffs, and the stone cold nuts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game variations you can play with this deck include: Texas Holdem, Greek Holdem, Heads-Up Holdem Solitaire, Multi-Way Holdem Solitaire, Holdem Flash Cards, and Blind Man's Bluff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
