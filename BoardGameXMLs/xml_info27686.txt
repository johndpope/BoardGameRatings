			<description>Each player starts with a pawn, $5000 and a loan of $10,000. Then, each player must buy his or her first car. In turn, a player rolls the dice and advances one&amp;rsquo;s own pawn on the track and react to where ever the pawn lands. During the course of play a player may buy and use service stations and garages, purchase insurance, get involved in accidents, collect income and get stars, which represent safe driving awards. When a player buys a second car, that player takes two consecutive turns even though one still has only one pawn on the gameboard. A player who buys a third car may take three consecutive turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The path the players travel on the gameboard crosses itself twice. There is a traffic light at one intersection that regulates movement as players approach it. The traffic light changes when a player lands on one of four &amp;ldquo;red dot&amp;rdquo; spaces. This allows players approaching from the other direction to advance while stopping traffic from the first direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to accumulate seven red stars and purchase the Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham for $10,500 is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
