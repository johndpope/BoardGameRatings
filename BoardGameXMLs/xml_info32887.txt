			<description>A unique game full of sports trivia. Produced in cooperation with the national federation Finnish Athletics. The game contains hundreds of questions regarding Finnish sports heroes and events since the beginning of the Finnish independence in 1917. Includes also fabulous picture cards, in which the players try to recognise athletes and glorious moments from the history and present-day of Finnish sports.  Do you know... How tall is a hurdle in men&amp;rsquo;s 110 m hurdles? And how many Olympic bronze medals did Paavo Nurmi achieve? Find out all this and much more in the awesome Sports Trivia game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
