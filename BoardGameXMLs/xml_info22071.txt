			<description>Pendoka is a set of small wooden spheres and plastic connectors. The spheres have four holes each, so you can build dodecahedrons and different three-dimensional structures with penta- and hexagons, varying the possible forms, twisted and shrinked ... the fact you can turn the connectors even if it is already sticking in a hole, offers many ways for construction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are different kinds of games you can play with Pendoka, from easy to difficult:&lt;br/&gt;At &amp;quot;Master of Pentagon&amp;quot; the players get a certain number of colored spheres and connectors, each player his own color. The goal is to build after a couple of rules and hinder the others from building. Winner is the first player who built all his parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At &amp;quot;F&amp;uuml;nferkette&amp;quot; (five-in-a-row) the winner is, who built the first five of his parts in a row, at &amp;quot;Your Turn&amp;quot; you have to enclose a sphere of the contrary player ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are even more Games in it, so Pendoka is not a single game of its own, but more a system, like Spiel (with hundreds of dice) - you can create your own rules, build as you want or have a look on the website for new ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.pendoka.de&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.pendoka.de&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
