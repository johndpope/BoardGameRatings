			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For nearly a decade, Goodman Games has been publishing adventure  modules generally considered to be among the best in the industry. With more than 100 adventures in print and the single longest-running adventure module brand on the market, Goodman Games has established a track record for writing adventures that don&amp;rsquo;t suck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At Gen Con 2007 we ran a seminar called &amp;ldquo;How To Write Adventure Modules That Don&amp;rsquo;t Suck,&amp;rdquo; which was packed to standing room only. This has quickly become one of our most popular Gen Con events. This year, we&amp;rsquo;ve expanded our offerings to include this book of essays. Compiled from experienced adventure writers with multiple published adventure credits, these essays should provide tips to improve your adventure writing skills. We hope you benefit from improved home games and perhaps drive some quality submissions in our direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regardless of the advice offered here or elsewhere, remember that the primary definition of an adventure that doesn&amp;rsquo;t suck is one that your players enjoy. If your gaming group walks away happy and has stories to tell for years to come, it was a great adventure. I hope this booklet provides you with some more of those adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
