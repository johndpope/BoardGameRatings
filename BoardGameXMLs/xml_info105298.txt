Each location consists of 20 levels filled with treasure to grab, enemies to avoid and puzzles to solve. Snowy's only tools are his wits, his agility and his trusty pick axe, so he needs all the help you can give him.&lt;br/&gt;One of your tasks will be grabbing bonuses that can help Snowy survive.
