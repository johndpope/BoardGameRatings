			<description>Bandits of the Crab Nebula is a game set in a chaotic universes where cunning rogues search for contraband  to sell, all while avoiding the wrath of the Space Cops. Players pick from one of ten different ships, all with their own unique ability, and try and avoid asteroid belts, mine fields, and even police barricades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control their ships speed, manage what is in their various hulls, install upgrades to better their chances of winning, and even play special cards to sabotage others. But they must also be careful to not be too greedy, because hidden in the deck where they find their items and cargo are special events that rarely end up good for anyone. These events can be as simple as one player discarding one piece of cargo, and as complex enough to warp everyone to a new location, have two players swap minds, or even put a ship swallowing black hole into play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aforementioned Space Cops are also a hassle, but also what sets the game apart from its peers. Players must manage how much cargo they are carrying and where they store it, because they might end up being accosted by the Space Cops when passing through a Police Barricade or when a rival player blows the whistle on them. If a Space Cop searches the Players ship and finds contraband, they must then deal with the consequences!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
