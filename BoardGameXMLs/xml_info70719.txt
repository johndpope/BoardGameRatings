							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Warcraft II is a fantasy-themed real-time strategy game published by Blizzard Entertainment. The first version, Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness, was released for MS-DOS in 1995 and 1996 for Mac OS, and was followed by the expansion pack Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal later in 1996. In the same year, Blizzard released for the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn Warcraft II: The Dark Saga, which provide the campaigns of Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness and Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal, but are the only versions without multiplayer facilities. The Battle.net Edition, released in 1999, provided Blizzard's online gaming service, Battle.net, and replaced the MS-DOS version with a Windows one. Gamers can play AI opponents in separate Human and Orc campaigns. The game also provides stand-alone scenarios and a map editor to create further ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the map, players must collect two or three resources, and to produce buildings and units in order to defeat an opponent in combat on the ground, in the air and in some maps at sea. As all three resources become exhausted during the game, gamers must collect them efficiently. The more advanced combat units are produced at the same buildings as the basic units but also need the assistance of other buildings, or must be produced at buildings that have prerequisite buildings. The largest of the main screen shows the part of the territory on which the gamer is currently operating, and the minimap can select another location to appear in the larger display. The fog of war completely hides all territory which the gamer's has not explored, and shows only terrain but hides opponents' units and buildings if none of the gamer's units are present.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Warcraft_II:_Tides_of_Darkness,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
