							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ordeal Before Shuri</name>
									
			<description>From the front cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ordeal Before Shuri provides eight individual scenarios and a new campaign game depicting the assault of the American 96th and 27th Divisions against the Japanese garrison on Okinawa. You'll also receive new rules for additional weaponry, such as the Japanese 330mm 'Spigot' mortar, VT Fuses, and 4.5 inch Air to Ground Rockets, plus extensive play aids and charts. The terrain is inhospitable as any Pacific battlefield faced by American soldiers during the Second World War and each individual terrain feature is faithfully depicted on the game map. Ordeal Before Shuri is the beginning of a three-game series of modules depicting the Battle of Okinawa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another Squads &amp;amp; Leaders compatible module from Critical Hit!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
