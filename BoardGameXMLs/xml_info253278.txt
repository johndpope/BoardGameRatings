			<description>The players have to get their 4 pawns from the spaces of their color on the light blue &amp;quot;strategic field&amp;quot; to the yellow space ringed by their color and from there around the game board to their destination spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the strategic field movement is one space per turn. Movement is blocked by other pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the track around the game board, movement is determined by a die. If a pawn gets on a space on the outer track, which is already occupied by an opponent's pawn, the later is thrown out and has to start anew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
