							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bathhouse</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This public bathhouse is a small amenity that could be found in any town or city. It is usually a boon to public health, at least for those that can afford the entrance fee. Often, but not always the bathhouse is sponsored by wealthy individuals and just as often they want to earn a little more then the communities respect and gratitude.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The building itself is a domed building with thick windowless walls to make heating it affordable. The walls are not only quite sturdy they are covered in fine marble as well. The floors are tiled with precious mosaics contrasting those of the central pool. The only actual window of the building can be found high above the pool in the center of the cupola.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first room you enter is the anteroom, where a number of lockable strong chests serve to hold the guests clothes and other belongings as well as the fresh towels the guests will receive in exchange. Thick metal reinforced wooden doors separate the anteroom both from the streets outside and the actual bath. The servants of the bathhouse will usually make sure only one set of doors is opened at any time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the guests pass the inner door a short flight of marble stairs lead up to a semitransparent curtain of fine silk, which serves as one last barrier before they enter the bath. The Bathroom itself is circular surrounded by a number of niches behind curtains similar to those you pass entering the room. The central element of the room is its circular pool. Its circumference consists of a marble bench where bathers can sit in the pleasantly warm water while its center is just deep enough that most people can keep their head above the surface simply standing upright.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the bathroom is brightly lit by a number of glow orbs the niches behind the curtain are only dimly lit. Similarly the air behind the curtains is usually dry and warm while it has more of a wet heat in the central bathroom. The niches are all equipped with a number of wooden benches for guests that wish to retire and rest for a bit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
