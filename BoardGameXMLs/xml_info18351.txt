							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">West Bank Gamer&#039;s Game</name>
									
			<description>Greg Schloesser, founder of the Westbank Gamers, has moved to the mountains of Tennessee.  Now, all of his friends in the Westbank Gamers are racing to be the first to visit him at his new home.  However, before they can visit, they must first race across the United States in search of chips, cookies and sodas.  This way, they won't arrive empty-handed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was the brain-child of several members of the Westbank Gamers group.  It has mechanics that are similar to Ticket to Ride, but includes an abundance of event cards.  Plus, everything is custom-tailored to the Westbank Gamers, its members, and various experiences through the years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must collect various sets of cards in order to complete routes between major U.S. cities.  The cards depict the faces of five Westbank Gamers stalwarts:  Lenny Leo, John Moore, Jim Fairchild, Michael Aucoin and Jerry Maus.  Each time a new city is reached, an event card is drawn.  The cards tell the story of infamous occurrences during the Westbank Gamers history, and cause a wide variety of events to occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory goes to the player who collects the needed cards, manages his hand properly, and survives the chaos of the events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The production quality is outstanding, thanks to the talents of Jim &amp;quot;Dr. Z&amp;quot; Fairchild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
