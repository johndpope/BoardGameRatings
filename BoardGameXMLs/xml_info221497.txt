			<description>The Takashi clan have long followed the teachings of Michi and unlike some of the other clans in the Jwar Isles strictly adhere to its teachings when raising the next generation. The Michi priests already offer the support of their military arm in the form of the Seishin na Geoi, but are not opposed to accompanying any believes on their paths, whether that leads them to battle or otherwise. Through years of dedication the Michi priests are able to evoke the protective powers of their ancestors, dousing flame, neutralising poisons or the intrusive commands of others. The presence of the spirits can also be used to distract and block the concentration of enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blister contains one model, one 30mm base and one full colour profile card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
