			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DethKarz is a futuristic racing game, in which four teams compete to win a championship. The teams have specific car models which differ in speed, handling, acceleration and endurance. Two kinds of projectile weapons are used in the game, as well as a selection of powerups including, among others, Nitro, three different kinds of shields and three different kinds of missiles. There are four locations where the races take place, each of which has three different tracks, giving 12 tracks altogether to the player to race on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
