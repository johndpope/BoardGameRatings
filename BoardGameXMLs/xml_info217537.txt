			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This compilation  includes the entire line of Far East Adventure Path titles: Imperial Heroes, Road to Destiny, Under Frozen Stars, The Baleful Coven, The Way Of Ki and Meditations of the Imperial Mystics.     &lt;br/&gt;      &lt;br/&gt;Imperial Heroes: Pregenerated Characters. Our second set of 8 rules-legal, fully fleshed-out, ready-to-play pregenerated 1st level characters created specifically to shine in a Far East Adventure Path or any campaign with Asian influences, written Neil Spicer and the Legendary Games Design Team, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Akobi Thiesson, honor guard cavalier&lt;br/&gt;    Jin Thiesson, human rogue&lt;br/&gt;    Masato Koshin, martial artist monk&lt;br/&gt;    Caladrel Qoervari, bladebound magus&lt;br/&gt;    Saroune Anzoletta, scrollmaster transmuter&lt;br/&gt;    Kieyanna Waide, cleric of the Goddess of Love&lt;br/&gt;    Ragnar Bralgweir, invulnerable rager barbarian&lt;br/&gt;    and last but not least&amp;hellip; Nurch, goblin ninja!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To top it all off, each character comes with preselected choices as they advance in the first few levels, and also include notes about their ultimate design goals so you know what you are working towards. We haven&amp;rsquo;t even mentioned the terrific full-color character portraits by Tanyaporn Sangsnit, Frank Hessefort, and Colby Stevenson!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meditations of the Imperial Mystics brings together the sublime secrets of joining mind, body, and spirit with the study of magic as recorded by the revered masters and their fanatical acolytes in ages gone past. Though fragments of their unattainable wisdom have survived in bits and pieces, the true original sources are accounted as great treasures among those who hold them. Rarely have their mysteries been unfolded, but gathered together they wait for you. You will find 18 ki-related feats, from Mindworm and Recenter Flow to Dream Travel and Aura Absolution, as well as 6 new spells, from paradox to steal dying breath. In addition, these tomes contain unique ki training and ability enhancement rules through the study of esoteric texts of the ancient masters, broadening the powers of qinggong while exploring the deeper connections of ki, magic, and mysticism, including supernatural acupuncture, internalization of extreme yin and yang, linkage of mind, spirit, and fate through spirit-auras, and the mortification of the flesh to span the threshold of life and death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Body Outside Body, a teak-covered tome whose inscrutable diagrams unfold the mysteries of ki auras and their connections to knowledge, wisdom, fate, and the mind.&lt;br/&gt;    The Instructions of Yin-Blood and Thundering Yang, a unique inverting scroll that read forwards explicates the malleability of cool, yielding yin while read in reverse exposes the eruptive possibilities of fulminant yang, and the proper channeling of each power.&lt;br/&gt;    Prayers of Empty Flesh &amp;amp; Undying Ki, recorded on an infinitely unspooling prayer wheel that draws the mind and soul more deeply the more its chant is intoned, unveils the secrets of straddling the borders of life and death, of making transcendent spirit master base flesh.&lt;br/&gt;    Seven-Ghost-Needles, an academic and clinical treatise on the inner flows of ki through the body and mind and how to focus and channel it through the dantian centers of jin, shen, and wuji.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Road to Destiny. A terrific sandbox adventure for 2nd-level characters! A legacy of death bears bitter fruit in the northern coastlands, as brothers long separated each rise to the call of their darkling heritage. A new destiny has arisen in the west that threatens to shake the foundations of an empire half a world away, but not if Ranulfr the White Wolf and his one-eyed sibling can waylay these would-be heroes on their Road to Destiny! Danger, treachery, and downright skullduggery lie around every turn, and characters will need their wits as well as their weapons if they hope to succeed. This adventure designed for 2nd-level characters offers the chance to earn additional experience during a Far East Adventure Path campaign as the heroes set out on their epic caravan journey to the far side of the world, or it can serve as a self-contained adventure sandbox adventure suitable for any campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Road to Destiny marks the Legacy Games debut of not one but TWO superstar finalists: not only author Jim Groves but also cartographer extraodinaire Pedro Coelho! With fantastic artwork by the talented Jason Juta, Road to Destiny is a 24,000-word epic adventure you will not want to miss regardless of whether you are running the published Adventure Path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Baleful Coven. Battling a conspiracy to destroy the future empress before she can realize her imperial destiny, you have overcome all who stood in your way. As you set out to cross the endless cold lands at the top of the world, however, your enemies are not so quick to forgive or forget the dead left in your wake. A mother&amp;rsquo;s love is undying, but so too is her hate. In her eyes, you are murderers, and she will gather dark sisters from far abroad to draw you into a mystic nightmare from which there will be no escape!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure for characters of 6th to 7th level supplements the epic journey through the northern wilds of the Far East Adventure Path campaign. It allows GMs to show the dynamic nature of the campaign world as forces they thought defeated turn out to have allies that do not take the defeat of their kin lightly. While easiest to include as part of the journey through the mountains of the subpolar north as their caravan approaches the arctic, scaling notes suggest methods for leveling up the adventure for use after the arctic crossing as the PCs&amp;rsquo; caravan descends into the Eastern Realms. Apart from an Adventure Path, this adventure can be easily dropped into any campaign to infuse it with an air of malevolent witchery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Way of Ki. The power of ki lies latent within all things, flowing through mind, body, and spirit alike and able to be seen and harnessed by those with the focus, devotion, and dedication to master themselves and achieve perfect unity and balance. The game describes ki only in terms of the mystic powers manifested by the monk and ninja, and The Way of Ki contains a wealth of options for increasing the variety and flavor of what these classes can do through their mastery of meditative practice and transcendental contemplation. The power of ki, however, is universal, available to anyone with the focus, desire, and discipline to master it, and The Way of Ki allows characters of every class to unleash this power, adding it to or infusing it within their normal class abilities. Unlock the great mysteries and transcend the natural into the sublime. The game touches on these secrets only briefly, in the context of the mystic powers manifested by the monk and ninja. If ki truly represents the extension of the self into communion with the universe and its hidden flows, however, its secrets should be possible for anyone to master with the proper instruction and dedication. By exploring The Way of Ki, now they can!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will find 22 general feats, from Composure and Ki Meditation to Sap Ki and Yogic Levitation. For the martially inclined, there are an additional 21 combat feats, including Hadouken, Mighty Kiai, Shattering Strike, and Unyielding Stance. For masters of the mystic arts, there are 16 magical feats including Graceful Calm, Perfected Creation, and Unbounded Conversion. Besides these 59 feats are notes for integrating ki and its use with every class in the game, including vows of discipline and their impact on ki, with special attention paid to expanded options for the the monk, ninja, and samurai.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under Frozen Stars. On an epic journey across the far frozen wastes, your characters seek their destiny and that of the future empress. Yet at the top of the world, having overcome the ravening storms and dark forces arrayed against them, you discover a marvel of legend, a ruined city both ancient and alien. Surely you cannot simply pass it by without exploring it and seeing what mysteries have lain untouched for time out of mind. Then again, if the rumors told in the caravan are true, perhaps others have come not so long ago, leaving behind a mysterious treasure that may be of great aid in claiming your imperial destiny in the eastern realms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure for characters of 7th to 9th level supplements (with scaling notes to use the adventure with higher or lower-level adventurers) the epic journey at the midpoint of the Far East Adventure Path campaign. It allows PCs a chance to stop and explore one of the notable locations they discover along the way, helping balance out what can become an arduous grind of seemingly disconnected events on their polar crossing. Apart from an Adventure Path, this adventure serves as an excellent introduction to a desolate lost city hidden by nigh-impassable terrain, yet containing connections to past and future, where east meets west.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
