			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dinner Guests is a story roleplaying game about a dinner party at a lavish mansion that turns to murder. Done in the style of Agatha Christie, Murder by Death, and Clue, the Dinner Guest is a funny romp through a dinner, murder, and resolution. Will you be the aging British Lord with too much time on his hands, looking for excitement? Are you the spoiled niece who wants the inheritance all to herself? Or perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ll play the confused house guest, way over your head in someone else&amp;rsquo;s scheme?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Protocol game series uses vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles to tell a story. Each story explores disparate characters dealing with adversity and isolation in a dramatic fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dinner Guests is a zero-prep game for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. Home requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This series presumes some understanding of GMless game protocol: scene-framing, shared authority, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
