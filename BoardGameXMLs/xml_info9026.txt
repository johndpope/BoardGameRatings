							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Johnny Bravo Catch Him If You Can Game</name>
									
			<description>Tagline: The game where you try to catch Johnny in action!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game based off the cartoon &amp;quot;Johnny Bravo&amp;quot;, each player is dealt a hand of four cards (one each of Action, Friend, Location, and Quote). Players then race to deduce which cards other players hold. This is done by visiting the special cartoon squares that force an opponent to reveal a card to you, or by drawing Johnny Cards that are played immediately. These cards have a variety of effects, including directing another player to reveal a card to you (or vice-versa). Most of these cards also have an action that must be performed, such as &amp;quot;Show off one of your karate moves&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Run around the board&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to deduce someone else's hand and move to the appropriate T.V. set square on the board wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes the board, 16 hint cards (four each of Action, Friend, Location, and Quote), 20 Johnny cards, 4 crayons, 4 erasable hint-tracking sheets, and one die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
