							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mikado Reisspel</name>
									
			<description>travel version of Mikado game; involves avoiding (or winning) colored little balls that will fall through after the Mikado stick have been pulled out of the stack. The stack is still kind of random, but is now fixed in a cilinder,that allows for playing on any surface (allthough playing in the back of a car might prove a bit difficult)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user sunmmary:&lt;br/&gt;24 sticks are put through little holes in a cilinder, thereby creating some kind of 'net' blocking the opening of the cilinder. 17 blue balls and 1 yellow ball are poured over and are effectively blocked.&lt;br/&gt;Then players may retreive a stick from the cilinder, 1 by 1, trying to avoid (or in a variant: to maximise) the number of balls falling through. The blue balls count for 1 and the yellow ball counts for 5 points. Balls lying on top of the stack of sticks may be manipulated when in the process of retreiving a stick, thereby forcing of preventing them from falling through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a fun little game played by 2 to 4 players. Children like the colours and the balls falling through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
