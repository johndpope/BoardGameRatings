							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">50 Wasteland Swap Meet Vendors, Set 3</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the days after civilization the once proud department store chains, grocery stores, and other big retail outlets are replaced by loose, flea market style vendors looking to trade the assorted merchandise and goods that they have scavenged from the ruins. This list provides 50 of such vendors along with the most important items that they have for sale. The GM should feel free to house these vendors anywhere they choose, from merely hawking goods from the backs of vehicles in an old parking lot to being huddled up in a dark and dreary abandoned warehouse. Though intended for use in post apocalypse game settings, this list may also be useful as a list of modern day flea market vendors with a wee bit of tweaking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
