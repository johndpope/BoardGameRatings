			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ENDURANCE - A test of man and machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE MAN - You the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE MACHINE - A 24 hour road race bike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Endurance gives you the chance to compete in the hard world of long distance bike racing. Success depends on team effort: The effort of your riders driving on into the darkness of night and the chill of dawn. The effort of your pit crew - split second re-fueling, tyre changes and crash repairs all count to your final team placing. Clock up the points during an individual race duel or an full championship season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Endurance is a simulation of a 24 hour motorbike race in which the player is managing a team of two bikes. However the player does not directly control the bikes. Instead orders are issued to the riders of the bikes - to ride conservatively (which might be used to protect a lead, reduce fuel consumption and reduce the chance of actions), normally or as fast as possible (with associated penalties to fuel, tyre-wear, etc.). Choosing when to pit is also important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior to the race, the player selects the engine and chassis characteristics, along with the tyre type. Each of these will have an impact on various aspects of performance in the race (maximum speed, miles per gallon, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the race the pit stops are key. When a bike comes into the pits, the player directly controls the pit crew, who must move to the correct part of the bike in order to perform various tasks such as refueling, making repairs, changing tyres and/or brake pads, etc. Pit stops also give the opportunity to switch riders, who each have different characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By G.P. Munday &amp;amp; B.P. Wheelhouse&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amstrad version: Peter Taylor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
