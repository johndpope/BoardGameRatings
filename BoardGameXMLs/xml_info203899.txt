							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Drunken Feats</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ninety-Nine Bottles of Beer on My Sheet&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When they aren&amp;rsquo;t delving dungeons, adventurers can often be found in taverns, where they while away the hours planning their next big score, and spending whatever&amp;rsquo;s left of the last one on booze of all sorts, or so we are told. While there are a handful of feats and archetypes scattered here and there that allow characters to benefit from drinking alcohol, they are few and far between, without much cohesion, and generally restricted to just one or two classes. For the most part, if you want your brawler, swashbuckler, or fighter to gain the same sorts of benefits from drinking that drunken masters or drunken ragers do, you&amp;rsquo;re largely out of luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents twenty-three new feats relating to the consumption of alcohol. Alchemists with Alcoholic Admixture can mix booze into their extracts, and Angry Drunk allows you to enter a rage whenever you consume an alcoholic beverage. Drunken Rush allows you to negate the penalties of becoming intoxicated, while also giving you the option to make wild attacks, leaving yourself open to deal great amounts of damage. Drunken Stumbling, on the other hand, allows you to use your lack of control to your advantage, effortlessly dodging foes&amp;rsquo; attacks, and Mind Fog allows you to use the pleasant haze of drunkenness to block out harmful mental assaults. This book contains all this, and much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
