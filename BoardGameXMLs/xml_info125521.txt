			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic Maps is a compilation of three previous releases from The Fantasy Cartographic: Caverns, Tunnels and Caves: Battlemaps 1 and Caverns, Tunnels and Caves: Battlemaps 2, and Terrain Monkey's Hand Drawn Maps, Volume 1, which are no longer available separately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Caverns, Tunnels, and Caves: Located within these pages are 30 &amp;quot;old-school style&amp;quot; maps of the underground. Black and white, clean, and simple, these generic maps can be used by the imaginative DM (or GM) as the basis for heroic adventures in any realm!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Terrain Monkey's Hand Drawn Maps: This presents the maps for five distinct fantasy locations for inclusion by a DM into his or her campaign world. It is for those DMs who take pleasure in using hand-drawn, quality maps when designing adventures. These maps are generic in that they can be used with any fantasy RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic Maps brings you maps contained in those products &amp;quot;remastered&amp;quot; to appear more attractive and at a price lower than previously available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
