			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is G-Core?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;G-Core is a simple set of rules for use in any genre. Spawned and updated for the modern gamer, G-Core roots come from the original Marvel Super Heroes or more famously known as FASERIP. This isn't the original FASERIP nor is it a product of Marvel Comics, but it is 99% compatible with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things we've updated from FASERIP:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Talents have now become Special Focus&lt;br/&gt;     Instead of Fighting, Agility, Strength, Endurance, Reason, Intuition, and Psyche we now have: Rumble, Agility, Might, Moxie, Smarts, Perception and Spirit.&lt;br/&gt;     The tables are gone! After play testing using a simple ten-sided die, we found a better way to make resolutions! By doing this it became much more comic book than the previous incarnation.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worried about real compatibility?  We took a character from the old FASERIP game and changed it to G-Core in less than 20 seconds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What changed in Prime?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New ORIGIN and HERO TYPE rules for awesome character creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Streamlined powers, with less reference back into the book. Add to that complete overhauls on other areas to make the book look clean and easy to use!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
