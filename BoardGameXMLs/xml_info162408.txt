			<description>A previously unpublished expansion for the ASL system. Included as an insert to Tactical Wargamer's Journal, Issue 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kruglowka Railway is a two-player scenario depicting the fighting near the Dneiper River in July 1941.  In addition to the scenario, extensive playtest notes and historical articles are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tactical Wargamer's Journal (ISSN 1918-9729), published on a non-regular schedule, covers topics of interest on all aspects of the world of commercial tactical wargaming, with its focus set on warfare at the man-to-man, squad and platoon level in the 20th Century and contemporary era. Tactical Wargamer's Journal (TWJ) places emphasis on both military history and the history of tactical level gaming itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Issue 1 focuses on the history of the Gro&amp;szlig;deutschland Regiment from 1939-1942, and the GD is featured prominently in this scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
