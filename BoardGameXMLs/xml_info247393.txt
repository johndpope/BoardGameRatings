			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lost and Forgotten Island is a survival game involving cooperation and decisions between different values.  It's played by one, two or three people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're all stranded on a desert island.  On each turn, you can individually work on the boat (to escape from a coming storm) or mine for gold.  Each player also has tools to help accomplish the different tasks; tools can be traded with other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lost and Forgotten Island was written by Bruce Hicks and published as type-in source code in Creative Computing Vol. 6, No. 3, March 1980.  The source code initially was provided by Ken Modesitt and revised by Jeffrey Yuan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
