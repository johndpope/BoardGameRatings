			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Super Story War is a hilarious party game where 3 to 8 players battle each other by telling stories, referencing pop culture, and making stuff up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as a character like a Pirate, a Detective or a Mad Scientist. Each card is only as powerful as the story you build around it. No numbers, no dice, just your imagination!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Story War is designed to be played on its own, but the cards can be shuffled with other volumes of Story War for even crazier match-ups!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round of play, one player is considered to be the Judge. The Judge draws a Battlefield card, that determines where the battles will take place. The other players split into teams, and play Warrior cards from their hand onto the table. Then the battle commences, with players on each team using their imagination to tell the Judge why their warriors would win in a fight against their opponents, or how they would defend against their opponents' attacks. Examples from the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Police Dog reads you your rights!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;But the Ninja vanishes into the shadows!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Judge is the final arbiter of what is and isn't permissible, and also decides any challenges. Players can also use Item cards from their hand to add more collateral to the fight (&amp;quot;Alien uses this Jetpack to escape!&amp;quot;). When one team is completely defeated, or when the Judge is ready to rule in one side's favor, the round is over. Winning teams keep their used Warriors as victory cards. The game ends when everyone has had a chance to be the Judge once or twice (depending on the number of players), and the teams with the most victory cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
