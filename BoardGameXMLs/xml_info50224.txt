			<description>Taken from the Warehouse 23 product description:&lt;br/&gt;Want for Nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Eaters of the Lotus are back, and these screechy-voiced eunuch sorcerers are looking for trouble! Now encased in a durable hardcover binding, what they've got left to protect - their secrets - is better protected than ever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atlas Games is pleased to announce the return of the rarest and most sought-after Feng Shui sourcebook from the ancient era. In the year 69 A.D., a conspiracy of eunuch sorcerers manipulate the emperor like puppeteers, and plot to dominate the world from their vantage point at the beginning of the Secret War. Now that they've discovered the Netherworld and its paths to the future, no place or time is safe from the Lotus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book gives you Gao Zhang, mastermind of the Lotus, and his emasculated co-conspirators, their organization, minions, plans and operations in other junctures, and their own documents and teachings. You even get an advantage over the Lotus: a running commentary from outside observers. Not a eunuch? Don't worry; you don't have to pay the Lotus's price to use this book's creature powers, sorcery schticks, characters, dragons, ghosts, demons, and a ready-to-play adventure! This is the definitive book on 69 A.D. When the Lotus finds out you've got it they'll blow up your brain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lust for Power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
