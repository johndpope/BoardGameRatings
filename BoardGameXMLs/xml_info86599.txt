			<description>&amp;quot;Ora et Labora&amp;quot; is Latin for for pray and work is a principle of the Benedictine monasteries. In this game players are young helpers arriving to the monastery to learn about the life of Benedictine monks. This can be done by completing tasks (that ask players to collect sets of cards like writing materials, sentences etc.). Board presents a clock with main activities of the monastery (like prayers, work in the scriptorium or in the garden) and players can can choose in which of the shortly starting activities they want to participate (represented by them moving pawn on board). Next the player can use the ability of the field he moved to (drawing card, exchanging card with a common poll, completing tasks etc.). Each completed task gives a player certain amount of points and allows him or her to draw another task card. Game follows this pattern until one of the players collect enough points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game presents Christian spirituality and sentences of st. Benedictine. &amp;quot;Skryptorium&amp;quot; was prepared in cooperation with Benedictine monastery in Tyniec, Poland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
