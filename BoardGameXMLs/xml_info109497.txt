							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Adventurer&#039;s Atlas: Outpost Qether (PFRPG)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventurer's Atlas: Outpost Qether is a generic location set on the borders of any two nations with a tense relationship. The outpost is home to all sorts: traders, criminals, farmers, and military men. It's a place where hope is fading fast now that distant rulers have decided that the fifty-year-old installation has outlived its usefulness. Unless someone finds a good reason for the outpost to remain, it will be shutdown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently however, local scouts have returned with news: hobgoblins have set up a small post to the east and are digging for...something. Perhaps it might be just the thing to give the outpost reason to exist. All they need now is a party of adventurers to find out what's going on over there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outpost Qether is designed to serve as a starting point for new plots, campaigns, or even single adventures. Included with the basic setting information is an adventure for characters of level 1-3, where the PCs will investigate a secret hobgoblin camp approximately one day&amp;rsquo;s march from the Outpost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
