							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Midnight Rescue!</name>
									
			<description>Midnight Rescue is an educational game designed to help strengthen children's reading and critical thinking skills. It is intended for children grades 3-5.&lt;br/&gt;In this game, the Master of Mischief (Morty Maxwell) is planning to make the Shady Glen School disappear at midnight using invisible paint. He is hiding in one of five robots brought to life from paintbrushes to try to deceive the Super Solver. The Super Solver has a camera and he will use it to take pictures of the robots, which reveals things they are carrying that have been rendered invisible as well as making the robot disappear. By reading various short stories and articles scattered around the school and correctly answering questions posed by the Master of Mischief at the end, the Super Solver gains clues as to what the correct robot is carrying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Midnight Rescue!&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
