			<description>Binatang is a big strategy game for the whole family. Unchartered territories, inexplicable wild animals and a secret path will be on the table for your family evenings and your time with friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is this game about?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player needs to create a sanctuary and fill it with various wild animals separating the territory between different kinds. There is a choice to be made: do you get the rarest animals or do you get as many as possible of  a common kind? Choose your strategy! Each inhabitant in your sanctuary gets you closer to the win! The winner is the one who moves further than others along the secret path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s unique about this game?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player fills the game space with various animals according to his own plan. And at the same time each move of any other player can change this tactic. Do you need a strategy or you just rely on luck? To focus on creating your own sanctuary or to try influencing the plans of others? Stick to your own style and remember, that even the youngest players have a good chance to outmaster seasoned strategists!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who is this game for?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Family time with kids&lt;br/&gt;    Kids parties&lt;br/&gt;    Teenagers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
