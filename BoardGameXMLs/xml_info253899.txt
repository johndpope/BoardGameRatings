							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">New Eden Project</name>
									
			<description>The new World War is devastating everything with atomic bombs, and due to that, the Government has come to a solution: building better cities over the ruins of the destroyed ones. It is up to the Emergency City Reconstruction companies to do that job and guarantee that these new cities represent the glory of the winning countries over their enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In New Eden Project, players will create projects for a glorious city, participating in the contest to be the chosen company to build the &amp;quot;New Eden&amp;quot;, a city that will take place of an enemy capital. By using city part cards in a tile-placement mechanic, they will have to build the project always paying attention to the Contest Requirements, sorted at the beginning of the match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 game modes: Populist (using sorted Contest Requirements, one of each of the types A, B, and C), Military (using all of the D Contest Requirements), or Elite (using both previous requirements). These requirement cards are the ones that tell the player how they are going to score in that match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regardless of the game mode, the game flow is always the same: players have 1 phase to buy cards using inspiration points (always 5 at the beginning of the phase), and 1 phase to place them in their projects (put them on the table). This continues until someone projects the 10th city part card, triggering the end of the game, when players check the Contest Requirements to see which cards have scored, and how many set-collection points they have won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
