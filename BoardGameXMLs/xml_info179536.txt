							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jasper and Zot</name>
									
			<description>Jasper and Zot is a one player game about two old, feuding wizards. The White Mage Jasper is quite the famous gardener and his pumpkins always win the blue ribbon at the local faire. His long-time adversary and neighbor, Zot the Necromancer, who is not good at growing living things, has summoned an army of the undead to smash all of Jasper's prize-winning pumpkins. Help Jasper defend his pumpkins by turning Zot's shambling minions into delicate white flowers and then burning them to ash!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jasper and Zot gameplay borrows heavily from classic arcade games. The player moves Jasper horizontally along the garden path while casting spells to either transform the approaching zombies into flowers or ignite those flowers and any nearby zombies with magical fire. The more you destroy with a single spell, the more points you earn. If you can survive two waves of Zot&amp;rsquo;s undead army, you win the game and earn a score based on how well you did.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
