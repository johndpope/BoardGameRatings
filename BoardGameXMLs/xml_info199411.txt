			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sellsword is a digital-only mini-expansion for Frostgrave: Fantasy Wargames in the Frozen City. This expansion gives wizards the option to hire a captain, a special type of soldier, to help lead their warbands. Unlike other soldiers in the game, captains may choose their own weapons, have a few special abilities known as 'tricks of the trade', and gain experience. Of course, such experience and versatility comes at a price, so captains are going to want more than the retainer given to most soldiers &amp;ndash; they want a cut of the treasure! Also included in this expansion are three new scenarios designed to give soldiers more of a chance to shine. All feature some type of limitation or obstacle to spellcasting that will force wizards to think a bit more about how much they rely on their magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
