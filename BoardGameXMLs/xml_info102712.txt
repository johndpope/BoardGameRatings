			<description>Dora the Explorer: Super Star Adventures is an adventure video game which was designed for preschoolers ages 3-6, developed by Imaginengine for the Gameboy Advance and published by Global Star in 2004. The game is based on the popular Nick Jr. franchise Dora the Explorer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike most GBA titles, which use written words to communicate, this one uses symbols, pictures, and a few spoken words. To start, players select one of the six Explorer Stars in the game. Each Explorer Star has a special power such as the ability to be noisy (the noisy star), or the talent to create music (the talent star). But the player has to catch the star before it will help. To catch a star, Players a hide-and-seek activity. Activities include maze navigation, matching games, side-scrolling race games, a &amp;quot;Frogger&amp;quot;-type game, a complete-the-pattern activity, and a play-a-song game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dora the Explorer: Super Star Adventures&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
