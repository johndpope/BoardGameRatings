			<description>A historically refined revision of the game Manifesto.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a map of the world divided into twenty regions. The components also include a custom deck of cards, consisting of Conflict Cards and Influence Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there are four or fewer players, the players choose to play one of the four standard ideologies: Communism, Fascism, Socialism, and Revolutionary Capitalism. If there are more than four players, three additional ideologies are available: Fundamentalism, Anarcho-Syndicalism, and Nipponism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players represent ideologies in conflict in the 20th century. The game begins in 1925 and ends in 2025. Twenty rounds are played, each representing five years. The winner is the player who controls the most countries at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
