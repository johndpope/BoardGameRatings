							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Cats Fight Fascism</name>
									
			<description>A rising wave of fascism is now sweeping across the galaxy, threatening to throw the Galactic Alliance under auto-ratic rule. To help grow their power, the fascist group known as The Rat Pack has been pinning the galaxy&amp;rsquo;s problems on cats. Now, these fuzzy creatures could be forced into exile all together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is unless a band of rebellious felines, led by Rocket (the freedom fighter), CJ (the medic), Pepper (the pouncer), and Ophelia (the smuggler) can stop these fascist forces from seizing power - all while building a new galaxy where all species are free together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Cats Fight Fascism is a cooperative game where you play as a band of rebel cats trying to stop fascists from seizing control of the galaxy. In Space Cats Fight Fascism, you&amp;rsquo;ll hop from planet to planet, scratching away at fascist forces and freeing animals pinned under the fascists&amp;rsquo; claws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to liberate four planets before the fascists take control of the Galactic Alliance. You&amp;rsquo;ll have three actions on your turn, and each player will use cards from their hand to build up the Animal Resistance on the twelve different home worlds. Cards and other basic actions will allow you to teleport across the galaxy, restock on supplies, as well as adopt new paw-ers as the game goes on - making each game unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the Resistance has at least four liberation tokens on a planet, you will place a Liberated flag there! When four planets have become liberated, the fascists have been defeated by the Resistance, and the animals of the galaxy rejoice! But watch out, because the fascists are always right on your tail! With cards like Anti-Cat Propaganda and The Fascists Use Laser Pointers to Distract Us!, they&amp;rsquo;ll try to wrestle back control of liberated planets from you while occupying even more planets to cement their power. The Fascists can win the game in one of three ways: by placing three Occupied flags on the board, by getting every single fascist onto the board, or by gaining too much power on the Fascism Scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
