			<description>CAN'T FOOL ME! you say? We'll see... If you like to think and have fun at the same time, this is for you. It&amp;rsquo;s fast, challenging and tricky, so prepare to pit your wits against others in this highly entertaining brain-teasing game. You're given a Keyword &amp;amp; Clue and have to find the Answer.  All set? If the Keyword is &amp;quot;Sun&amp;quot;, and your Clue says &amp;quot;Reach for a spoon, not your sunglasses&amp;quot;, be the quickest to shout out SUNDAE. If the Keyword is &amp;quot;Dragon&amp;quot;, and the Clue states &amp;quot;No knight ever tried to slay one&amp;quot;, yell out DRAGONFLY. Or try this: Your Keyword is &amp;quot;Comfort&amp;quot; and the Clue is &amp;quot;Money can't buy you love, but it can buy you this&amp;quot;. Did you guess the Answer: COMFORTER? So fooled or not, get ready to scratch your head, shout and laugh a lot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes: 320 Question Rounds on 160 Dual-Sided Game Cards, Gameboard, Game Pieces, Instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
