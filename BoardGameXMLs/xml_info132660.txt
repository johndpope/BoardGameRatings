			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seiken Psycho Caliber (Seiken means Holy Sword, possibly a reference to Excalibur) is an action RPG obviously inspired by The Legend of Zelda; the hero explores a fantasy world full of monsters and hidden treasure to rescue a fairy princess, and the sprites, animations, and screen transitions all work in a manner very similar to Zelda.  One way that Seiken Psycho Caliber is different from its predecessor is that the hero has to eat regularly to stay in fighting condition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seiken Psycho Caliber was part of Imagineer's Wave Jack program, which included extra media to immerse the player into the game world. SPC's materials included maps, a notebook, and an audio cassette.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
