							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pet Rescue Saga</name>
									
			<description>Pet Rescue Saga is a clicker game in which players click on groups of similarly coloured blocks in order to clear them from the screen. The game offers over 440 levels of play in an animal-themed adventure where players have to rescue a range of cute pets from the evil Snatchers. The aim is to clear enough blocks to guide pets to safety at the bottom of the screen while also achieving the minimum score required. Players need to think through the consequences of removing any one set of blocks as this will cause other blocks to move sideways or fall into play. Pet Rescue Saga also offers additional challenges in the form of caged pets, stony floors that require a key to unlock and diamonds that can only be removed by landing them on a stony floor. Pet Rescue Saga was launched on King.com in September 2009, on Facebook in November 2012, and on mobile in June 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
