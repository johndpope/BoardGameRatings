			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes a CD-ROM just isn't enough. You Don't Know Jack: the netshow brings home a slightly different version of the popular quiz show game via the Internet -- and for free. Several five to 15-second commercials pay for this online version of YDKJ, which features a new episode every Monday. Were you too busy one week and missed an episode of YDKJTN? Relax. There's a feature built in that enables you to play (or replay) past episodes, by yourself of with up to two friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
