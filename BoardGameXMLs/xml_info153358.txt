			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Year in the Making&amp;hellip;Again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Necromancerâ€™s Almanac: 2012 was a massive tome of character options of every sort, collected from the Necromancers of the Northwest website over the course of an entire year, and arranged in a simple, easy to use fashion to make all of its extensive content much more accessible at the gaming table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was such a success that we&amp;rsquo;re back again with another edition, creatively titled A Necromancer&amp;rsquo;s Almanac: 2013. This book is just as jam-packed as the last, with over fifty new archetypes, along with two new base classes and four new prestige classes. It also boasts well over 200 new feats, and a smattering of new traits. And don&amp;rsquo;t forget the massive collection of nearly 150 new magic items, or the nearly 50 pages of all new spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Necromancer&amp;rsquo;s Almanac: 2013 is a compilation of all the material produced in 2013 for Necromancers of the Northwest&amp;rsquo;s popular article lines Best in Class, Extraordinary Feats, Magic Market, and Obscure Arcana. Clocking in at 200 pages, it&amp;rsquo;s not hard to believe that this book was a full year in the making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside, you&amp;rsquo;ll find exciting and experimental new spells, which toy with taking magic in strange and unusual directions. You&amp;rsquo;ll find a feat for just about every occasion, and a magic item for virtually any need, plus dozens of in-depth archetypes for lots of exciting and evocative staples of the fantasy genre. With A Necromancer&amp;rsquo;s Almanac: 2013, you&amp;rsquo;ll have all the options to make exactly the character you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And what&amp;rsquo;s more, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to search through dozens of articles to find it. Everything has been collected, archived, and gathered in an organized fashion, making finding what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a breeze.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
