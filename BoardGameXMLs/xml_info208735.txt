							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scourge of War: Pipe Creek</name>
									
			<description>Scourge of War is the definitive American Civil War grand tactical wargame of this generation.  With impressive 3D graphics, an award-winning AI, pausable real-time play, historical battlefield terrain and orders of battle down to the regiment and battery level, Scourge of War captures the tactical challenges that faced the real Union and Confederate commanders more than 130 years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scourge of War: Pipe Creek is the first major battle expansion for Scourge of War: Gettysburg. Players will be able to command Union and Confederate forces in a what-if scenario during July of 1863 in northern Maryland. The Pipe Creek Line was a selected battle position for the Union&amp;rsquo;s Army of the Potomac as part of a circular assignment of the army&amp;rsquo;s corps. Historically, this plan was superseded by the Battle of Gettysburg, but now players will be able to experience what would have happened if the Pipe Creek Line plan was executed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion comes with three new 5 x 5 mile maps of the Pipe Creek Line position, along with six new and challenging single-player scenarios and three new multiplayer scenarios for each of the new maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scourge of War: Pipe Creek is an expansion and requires Scourge of War: Gettysburg to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
