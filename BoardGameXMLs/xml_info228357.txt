							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legacy of the Green Regent Fastplay Characters</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fastplay characters are primarily designed to play and advance by players who need a character but have little experience with Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, or those who don't have time to construct one. Each fast play character is keyed to one of the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Miniatures. If you play a fastplay character with that miniature, it unlocks a bonus that works exactly like a Campaign Card but is tailored for that particular character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take One for the Team: A player can play a fastplay cleric, fighter, rogue, or wizards and gain experience points for his or her default character. This option is only available if no PC at the session has a character with any class levels in any of these classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Level Kick: It's never too late to join Legacy of the Green Regent. As the campaign moves forward, so does the level of play. Existing characters that have not yet reached the new starting level advance to the new campaign level. At each kick, new fastplay characters are introduced and the campaign standards are updated to reflect the changes. The level kick at Winter Fantasy 2005 bumps the campaign up to 10th level with 30,000 gp base value. Level kicks ensure that game sessions are well balanced at events and that every player can keep pace with the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These pre-generated characters were provided for print-and-play use with LGR - Legacy of the Green Regent organized play.  They were provided as separate downloadable, five-page, PDF files.  Note that the characters derived certain intriguing abilities if represented by the correct D&amp;amp;D Miniature during play.  Available characters, all at 10th level, include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Shield Dwarf Fighter&lt;br/&gt;        Half-Orc Monk&lt;br/&gt;        Lightfoot Halfling Cleric&lt;br/&gt;        Moon Elf Ranger&lt;br/&gt;        Human Rogue&lt;br/&gt;        Human Wizard&lt;br/&gt;        Human Barbarian&lt;br/&gt;        Half-Elf Bard&lt;br/&gt;        Gnome Paladin&lt;br/&gt;        Half-Elf Druid&lt;br/&gt;        Moon Elf Sorcerer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
