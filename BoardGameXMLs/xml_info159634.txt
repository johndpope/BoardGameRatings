			<description>You're a mad scientist with the goal of evolving cute animals into minions in order to destroy the enemy's animals. Each creature can evolve into three different evolution trees, each with their own unique skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evilution is a stand-alone card game. Each player chooses four animals to start the game with and performs actions each turn to further their position. Once you kill all the opposing creatures, you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to evolve your animals, you'll need to purchase evolution trees. You can earn money through sponsorships as well as completing objectives. You can also use the money to hire lab assistants and purchase equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, every turn you'll either navigate random events or discover potions with good and bad effects. Some of your creatures may die, but that's a sacrifice you must be willing to make.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have what it takes to be the best Mad Scientist? Only time will tell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
