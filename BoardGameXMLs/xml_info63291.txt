							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Rotanoga Rapture</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Homecoming From Hell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Returning to your childhood home for the annual fall festival should be a time of happiness, fond memories and loads of nostalgia... but Rotanoga is not as you left it. This sleepy Maine fishing town has undergone a transformation - people wander the streets in a daze, ominous shadows flit at the edge of vision, dark whispers fill your mind with terrible urges and feelings of despair. There are some new faces in town, too, at the school, police station and even the local church, faces that hide secrets behind disarming smiles and offer more questions than answers. As rumors grow and the situation goes from bad to worse, it becomes clear that this year's festival promises to &amp;quot;summon up&amp;quot; more than just goodwill and jolly memories. One thing's for sure, however - there WILL be fireworks...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's Inside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rotanoga Rapture is a complete adventure for Horror Rules, the Simply Horrible RPG, a horror comedy game of ridiculous proportions. This 31pg supplement is packed with everything you need to play, including Bad Guys, Cast, backstory, artwork, maps, Plot Pushers and enough Sequel Suggestions and Plot Twists to turn it into five adventures instead of one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
