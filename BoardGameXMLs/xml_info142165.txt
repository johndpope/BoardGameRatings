							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slap the King</name>
									
			<description>Four cards are revealed for the players to remember... One card is slid below the King in the middle of the table and the rest are shuffled into the deck.  The King has hidden his only heir to the throne (one of the 4 cards the players just saw) and it is up to you to find them.  As you draw a card into your hand and play a card to family lineage lines on the table, you begin to prove which peasants and nobles are not related to the King, the hidden one becomes more apparent to everyone, as more cards are played to the table.&lt;br/&gt;Your family lineage lines on the table prove which people are not royal heirs. Players must complete family lines with a family crest card (to score extra points)  before the other player slaps the King and names the hidden heir.   You must decide between quickly exposing the King's secret before your opponent can play the right cards.. or making sure your family lines are complete so you score more points.   As the final cards are played in a round its a matter of seconds before one player slaps the king card and names the hidden heir card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game of strategy, deduction and timing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
