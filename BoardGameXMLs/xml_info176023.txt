			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gruesome Gangs is an exciting Pathfinder Roleplaying Game&amp;reg; compatible product line providing the Game Master with a collection of non-player characters (NPCs) designed to work together from the perspective of backstory, game mechanics, or both.  The groups are presented at different Challenge Ratings to increase their utility for multiple gamers.  In addition, this allows player characters (PCs) to encounter one of these groups early in a campaign and then again after both teams have gained experience with minimal extra work for the Game Master!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the entire team is unsuitable for inclusion in the campaign at the time, then NPC stat blocks can be used individually as needed.  A mixed approach can also be interesting.  By introducing a single foe into the campaign, this product gives a number of friends or allies that foe could call upon after running afoul of the PCs!  This gives the Game Master a ready-made answer to who would the NPC go to for assistance, or even who would come to avenge his death at the hands of the PC party!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using This Product&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product presents the overall history of the NPC team as well as the backstory for each individual member of the gang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each NPC has four stat blocks (CR 4, CR 9, CR 14, and CR 19) demonstrating his progression and growth over time.  As a visual indicator, the color of the name bar designates which stat blocks from each NPC are of equivalent Challenge Rating along with the CR text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Composition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each gang is comprised of multiple members which can include a mixture of races, class levels, and templates.  This section helps the Game Master compare different gangs&amp;rsquo; capabilities and make-up at a glance without having to review each stat block.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team Members&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Arasha Manflayer &amp;ndash; CE female orc&lt;br/&gt;    Grongrek the Bloody &amp;ndash; NE male half-orc&lt;br/&gt;    Humgret Warhavoc &amp;ndash; NE male half-orc&lt;br/&gt;    Tokrar Bileblood &amp;ndash; CE male human ogrekin&lt;br/&gt;    Wyrdomel Manflayer &amp;ndash; CE male orc afflicted wereboar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vileheart Reavers are a despicable crew of ruffians from the dregs of the population.  Rejected by both civilized and uncivilized societies, the gang remains on the move earning coin through mercenary contracts, assassinations, and their own nefarious schemes.  Often little more than bandits, the crew frequently runs afoul of regional leaders and the law.  The Vileheart Reavers learned long ago that adventuring is dangerous work, and it is far easier to ambush other adventurers while they are wounded and recovering and take their plunder than to seek riches on their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group consists of violent individuals who do not always get along.  They have no moral scruples and will do anything for the right price, which for several would include betraying one another.  The Vileheart Reavers are a very physical team who rely mostly on strength and brute force.  Their magical aptitudes are crude, but powerful, and rely heavily on hedge magic, dark arts, and bloody rituals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
