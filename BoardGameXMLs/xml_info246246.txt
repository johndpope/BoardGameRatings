							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Seven Bizarre Races</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s mix up the playbook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The races presented within are more than just a collection of minor attribute bonuses and abilities designed to get a bit more damage out of a longsword. These races are unique, vivid, and bizarre in a balanced and instantly recognizable way. They change the game, and present an excellent, fascinating toolkit for players interested in variety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With these bizarre races, nobody will forget who you are or what you look like. With these races, suddenly your game is new again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    BUNNYTAURS: Halfling-rabbit centaurs, quick and alert but gripped by instinctual cowardice.&lt;br/&gt;    KINDERCLOAKS: Plump, hooded shadows crafted from primitive magics that turn to petrified smoke in bright light.&lt;br/&gt;    MERRIEPETALS: Revelrous flowers which exude a certain allure which makes them irresistable &amp;ndash; or is it the hallucinogenic spores?&lt;br/&gt;    MISBORN: Gangly psychopomp-touched humans with the ability to talk to the dead and see through planes.&lt;br/&gt;    PAINTERLILIES: Two-dimensional sentient paintings, with the ability to meld onto surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;    SHADOWFRIENDS: Frail fey giants created by a child&amp;rsquo;s wish, disturbing in form but remarkably kind.&lt;br/&gt;    BLESMOLFOLK: Sluggish, pain-immune mole rats, carving out vast labyrinths and dungeons. Blesmolfolk are divided between four distinct racial castes: industrious workers, crafty warriors, conniving consorts, and willful queens. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
