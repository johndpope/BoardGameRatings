							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DeathSpank: The Baconing</name>
									
			<description>From the Company&lt;br/&gt;Another epic adventure awaits our hero named Deathspank. As Hothead Games recently announced, the series will be continued this summer with the release of the third and final entry of the unusual action/rpg/adventure game sequel. After legendary quests like collecting orphans (Deathspank Original) and saving christmas from the corrupted Santa (Deathspank - Thongs of Virtue), it seems like everything Deathspank did was just a preperation for one thing: The Baconing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, Ron Gilbert (the inventor of the Deathspank character) is working at Double Fine by now and therefore he will not be involved in the creation of The Baconing. Nevertheless, the game&amp;rsquo;s concept will be pretty much similiar to the known one. In the upcoming adventure, Deathspank will be searching the &amp;quot;Fires of Bacon&amp;quot; and in progress he has to survive tough battles against new rival: Anti-Spank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the fact that the debut trailer (see below) does not reveal any ingame scences, Hothead promised many improvements in the realm of gameplay and combat. They plan to enable the player to feel more in-control of his character. He will be able to attack enemies via Shield Bash and reflect ranged attacks. In addition, the enemies will act smarter by attacking from different directions and doing a better job at healing each other. Furthermore, the fighting areas will contain certain spots where Deathspank will be able to hide from incoming harm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, the game will contain more than 100 new quest, over 70 new characters and an additional difficulty level (&amp;quot;insane&amp;quot;). On top, we can look forward to more than 80 new weapons and a new combatant: Bob from Marketing! And regarding his skills like shooting laser eye beams, eating corpses for health, and eating live bodies for an additional attack option, he seems to be a cool guy and a good addition to the team&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the waiting time sits in until another fun-to-play title with hilarious deathspankish comedy hits the stores.. will Deathspank be able to save his bacon? (pun intended).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
