							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rabbit Match: The Game</name>
									
			<description>Players take the role rescue shelter managers, seeking victory by placing rabbits in quality homes and enhancing their reputation within the animal community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With each turn come more rabbit cards (the &amp;quot;roll for bunnies&amp;quot; command inspiring our sister game) as well as cards with potential adopters, crises, and opportunities.  Players grow their victory pile and point total matching rabbits with adopters according to adopter preferences, gaining bonuses if the rabbit is difficult to place (Is it sick or unfriendly? Does it disdain the litter box or other bunnies?) or part of a bonded pair--bunny-to-bunny bonding forming the other matching activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Too many bunnies for the available space (on an individual's tableau) and too few (or finicky) adopters at turn's end demand players negotiate with competitors who may have space, or get creative with bonding lest they have to send bunny foo-foos to paid foster care (with its victory point penalties).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards for personal assistants (with issues and assets), Easter, dump crises, media fads, rich and fickle benefactors are among the items that provide variety within games and between sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is designed, tested by gamers under the oversight of the Los Angeles Rabbit Foundation, a chapter of the House Rabbit Society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
