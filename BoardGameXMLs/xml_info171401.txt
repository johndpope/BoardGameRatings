			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where the previous two volumes were more or less random collections of curious curios, our third magic item compilation focuses on the forest and its denizens, both mundane and magical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the nearly forty magic items inside you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A staff that transforms those is slays--and even its wielder if you aren't careful--into fungus zombies.&lt;br/&gt;    Arrows that can pass unhindered through wood, living and dead.&lt;br/&gt;    A spear that can wind and twist about of its own accord, and transform into a snake.&lt;br/&gt;    A shield that comes to life when you attach it to a tree. It also knows a lot about the forest, if you've got the time and patience to listen to it.&lt;br/&gt;    A ring that makes others overlook you, for good or ill, until you make yourself known.&lt;br/&gt;    A scabbard made from the deadly basilisk, which even in death continues to produce a potent venom.&lt;br/&gt;    Mushrooms that allow you to live the memories of the deceased.&lt;br/&gt;    An instrument loud enough to literally wake the trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with 10+ Treasures and 10+ Treasures: Volume II, there's extensive advice on making your own magic items, as well as clarifications and suggestions on how to tweak some of them to better suit your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
