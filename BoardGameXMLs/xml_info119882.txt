			<description>Publisher's Description:&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Angham High! Remember how you didn&amp;rsquo;t believe your parents when they told you your school days were the best of your life? Looking back on them through the rose-tinted lens of nostalgia sure changes that. Class Dismissed is a role-playing game for those of us who miss the heady long summers of youth, the swish of the whacking cane or the taste of school tapioca (AKA frogspawn). Relive the glory days of hiding from the teachers, skipping class, scrumping apples, stealing a kiss behind the bike sheds and playing pranks on your mates. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll even foil the occasional robbery while you&amp;rsquo;re at it. School kids are good at that. Class Dismissed is a tabletop role-playing game of school days hijinx. All you need to play are a handful of polyhedral dice, some pencils and paper and a couple of friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
