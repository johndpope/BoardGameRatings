			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Officer Hutchinson swept over the brutality with dispassion and diligence. With every picture he took, with every swab of the blood, he told himself he was a servant of justice. He was a part of the team that was going to put that asshole away for life. For the past three years, detective Chuck Chalmers mentored and inspired him to whatever minor greatness he&amp;rsquo;d achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As he looked over the chalk outlines, he knew there was something he was missing. That&amp;rsquo;s why he&amp;rsquo;s the junior detective. He looked to his mentor. &amp;ldquo;Officer Chalmers, there&amp;rsquo;s something here I&amp;rsquo;m not seeing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The senior officer glances back from his cell phone. &amp;ldquo;If you think you&amp;rsquo;re missing something, it&amp;rsquo;s your mind telling you that you can&amp;rsquo;t accept the simplest answer.&amp;rdquo; He didn&amp;rsquo;t even stop hammering the keypad while he spoke. &amp;ldquo;Now get back to the picture-taking, Hutchinson.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Officer Chalmers, are you alright? You haven&amp;rsquo;t been yourself lately,&amp;rdquo; Hutchinson said, concerned. He didn&amp;rsquo;t even get an answer. Hutchinson shrugged and snapped a few more shots from another angle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Collection of Horrors is an anthology of Storyteller tools inspired by the Horror Recognition Guide that you can either use in conjunction with the Guide or as part of your existing Hunter: The Vigil chronicle. You can get a free introduction here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each story kit in the Collection of Horrors (which you can buy individually, as a bundle or as a subscription) contains variety of appropriate tools; usually an SAS scene, a character with a character sheet, and props ranging from maps and reports to print out and hand to your players, to short imbedded audio files that you can play at your gaming table. These kits represent a collection of evocative story tools that you can write a story around, drop into an existing SAS or even string together. They aren&amp;rsquo;t stories in their own right, but rather pieces that you can snap together into whatever shape you want. Using the Guide can add even more props and ideas to this anthology, but it&amp;rsquo;s not required to use the various story kits in the Collection of Horrors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
