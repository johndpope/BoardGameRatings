			<description>The Falcon Knight sneaks through the ruins of the Lion Knights&amp;rsquo; Castle on the hunt for the valuable treasure of jewels. A knight can easily get lost on such a mission. In what castle tower is he now? Find the Falcon Knight and, as a thank-you, receive part of the treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The youngest player starts. The game continues in a clockwise direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The person whose turn it is hides the knight underneath one of the two castle towers or under the bell tower. At the same time, the other players close their eyes or turn around and keep their ears pricked up! Maybe it gives out a telltale ring and you can work out where the knight is being concealed. Once the knight has been hidden, all the players can open their eyes again or turn back to the game and, in turn, guess where they think the knight is hiding. Each tower has a different colour, so that you just have to say the colour out loud. You are not allowed to touch or lift up the towers until everyone has had their guess.&lt;br/&gt;Before the secret is disclosed, you draw your bet. If you think the knight is under the bell tower, you take two jewels out of the linen bag &amp;ndash; no looking! If you think he is under one of the other two towers, you just take one jewel. Place the jewels in front of you (do not yet put them into the treasure chest): you only get to keep them if you have guessed correctly.&lt;br/&gt;Now the player who hid the knight discloses the secret and lifts up the tower hiding the knight.&lt;br/&gt;Did you guess right? Great! Then you get to keep the jewel(s) and put them into your treasure chest.&lt;br/&gt;All the players that guessed wrongly throw the jewels they had just drawn into the jewel tower.&lt;br/&gt;The player that hid the knight this round gets to keep any jewels that fall out of the tower.&lt;br/&gt;If you have too many of one type of jewel (more than four of one colour), throw the extra ones back into the linen bag and shake well.&lt;br/&gt;It is then the next player&amp;rsquo;s turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect four green emeralds and four white diamonds wins the game, and leaves the castle as the victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
