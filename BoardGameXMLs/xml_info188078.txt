							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Punctuation Bingo</name>
									
			<description>From the box:'&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Play your way to punctuation know-how with BINGO! Beginners and experts alike have an equal chance for BINGO, and everyone wins punctuation pointers every round.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Punctuation Bingo is an educational twist on traditional Bingo. Each player has a bingo card with two rows of four spaces each. On each space, a sentence with a missing punctuation mark is printed. The caller chooses and reads a card showing a punctuation mark and describing its use. Players must then search their bingo cards for a sentence missing that punctuation mark and mark it. When one player has completed the chosen pattern, he or she says &amp;quot;bingo,&amp;quot; the marked sentences are checked, and if correct, that player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
