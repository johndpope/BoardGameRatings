			<description>A strategic faction based die stacking and siege game. Take control of an elemental faction waging war over ancient ruins. Earn points by rebuilding ruins as high as you can; however, be wary of your adversaries who will try and knock them down with their siege engines.  As seen at PAX West 2016 in the Indie Megabooth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn players perform an action to explore new territory, move or fire their siege engine, or take control of territory with their leader. Then they roll dice to build up the ancient ruins on the board. The taller a ruin is, the more points it is worth but the bigger target it is to be knocked down by an enemy siege engine. Dice knocked out of play are captured and worth points at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, whoever has the most points currently on the board wins. There are five different scoring objectives (ruin height, color matching, captured enemy dice, faction objectives, and your faction leader's control) which can all contribute to your victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
