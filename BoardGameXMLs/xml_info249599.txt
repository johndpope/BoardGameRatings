			<description>Mankind will not be redeemed by our competition, but by our collaboration. It will come slowly, but it will come in time, as we turn our efforts to creating a world where we can all succeed, a little together at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Fabricators, you are one of those architects of a better future; working to create efficient manufacturing segments, 3d-printing factories and power plants, allocating resources as you try to make life for your workers worth living, and respect their labour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fabricators is a player-versus player low-confrontation card game for up to five players where players manage a small economic engine to try and develop an optimally efficient 3d-printed manufacturing sector in a utopian future. It plays in roughly forty-five minutes, and uses Action Selection and a card economy for players to build with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
