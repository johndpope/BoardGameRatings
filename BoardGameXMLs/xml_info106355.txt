			<description>Thunder Truck Rally (Known as Monster Trucks in Europe) is a monster truck racing game developed by Reflections where players select a monster truck or otherwise 4X4 vehicle equipped with monster truck tires and have the option of either racing or crushing cars in an arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with an array of options from choosing their game mode to choosing their race track. If a player chooses to race, they are faced with innumerous outdoor tracks, all of which feature various hills, bends and turns. The players must maintain careful driving however as every vehicle has a strength meter which measures the vehicle&amp;rsquo;s engine strength; if a player lands too hard from a jump their engine will receive damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Thunder Truck Rally&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
