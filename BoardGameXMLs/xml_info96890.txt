							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Autobackgammon</name>
									
			<description>When backgammon became a fad in the early seventies, the game went from that thing on the back of inexpensive checker boards to the gambling rage of the jet set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This solitaire game was created to cash in on the craze. Sixty pre-programmed games have been divided into four courses of fifteen games. Place one of the games into the tray. Using the slides in the frame of the tray, the player only sees one move at a time. After sizing up any given situation, the player advances a slide to see what backgammon champion Tim Holland would have done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains the tray, a really cheap backgammon set, thirty two game cards and rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
