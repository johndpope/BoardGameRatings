			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to The Broken and The Lost, a collection of source materials for Darwin's World 2nd Edition that offer a more detailed look at the &amp;quot;Tribal&amp;quot; background presented in the basic rules, bringing to life one of the most integral aspects of the post-apocalyptic genre: the barbarism of the post-Fall world. In addition, this series also takes a look at the &amp;quot;Brethren&amp;quot;, one of the major factions of the Twisted Earth setting detailed in the Darwin's World 2nd Edition rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to being a gamemaster aid, The Broken and The Lost presents new material fleshing out the many aspects of the &amp;quot;Tribal&amp;quot; background as a whole, including new feats, equipment, drugs and poisons, and advanced classes, all with a decidedly &amp;quot;primitive&amp;quot; cast. These new additions will hopefully bring new possibilities to the creation of both tribal NPCs and players characters alike, making them more vibrant and interesting, and allowing these much misunderstood and maligned savages to play a more important role in your post-apocalyptic games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
