			<description>Corvallis Unruh is a young pacifist from a small coastal town. He spends his days working for the local pharmaceutical distributor and taking his daily pain medication, even though he&amp;rsquo;s not sure he&amp;rsquo;s actually in pain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One night, his world is upended when a huge creature tears his family&amp;rsquo;s house apart, sending him on an adventure that he&amp;rsquo;s pretty sure he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be on with a companion who he&amp;rsquo;s pretty sure doesn&amp;rsquo;t want him there. Along the way, his companion, Angela, brings other people into the fold &amp;ndash; a mercenary, a professional adventurer, a nobleman, and a sorcerer &amp;ndash; but Corvallis is always alone. And he knows it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People who want to curry favor with Corvallis tell him that he&amp;rsquo;s some sort of Chosen One, but they fail, every time, to tell him that he&amp;rsquo;s been chosen to be a cog in a political machine with a thirst for profit. And where there is no money, there is only bloodletting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy a main narrative about the nature of power and violence. This narrative strongly relies on characterization to govern the main characters&amp;rsquo; interactions with each other. &lt;br/&gt;    View the perspectives of six well-defined characters with strengths and flaws that reflect their upbringing and experience. &lt;br/&gt;    The story doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop when the cutscene ends! Real-time banter and informed, ever changing non-player characters (NPCs) add to Elcaea&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere and ensure that you&amp;rsquo;ll never go uninformed.&lt;br/&gt;    Use the Sociability system to gain strength by interacting with those around you and progressing through the main narrative. You&amp;rsquo;ll be rewarded for knowledge about the personalities of your party members!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
