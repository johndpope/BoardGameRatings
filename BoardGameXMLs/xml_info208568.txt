							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Keys to the Capitals</name>
									
			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An educational game racing around the USA using the 50 Capital City Key Cards. 2-6 players start at their home towns state capital and pick from the Key Card deck to determine the prop plane route. Player picking the most key cards at end of game wins the round. Each player can check off the score pad the capital they claim. In event of tie player with their home capital wins. Ties are very rare in the 252 test games from our 2 working prototypes. Only a few. The game is very exciting and has 6 special effects that can turn the game even more exciting. Ages 7-seniors even a 4 yr old can play. Very popular with children that when they got the first prototype they play 30 times in a few week period and most rounds last 45-60 minutes average. Special effects occur 20-30 times a round when the two effects match on the dice. 2 regular dice, 2 special effect dice, 6 prop planes on stands, 50 key cards, score pad of 50 states check list. Great thing about the game is not needing to answer the questions but a memorization of the key card(s) of each state capital. It is a fun race game to collect most capitals. Object is to stay away from the long routes needed to get to the capitals. It is normal to have more than one card in your hand due to the extra key and steal a key effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
