			<description>Crystals of Zong is a computer game for the Commodore 64. Crystals of Zong is a simple maze-type action game taking place over a series of levels. Each level consists of nine single-screen rooms arranged in a 3&amp;times;3 grid. At the centre of each room is a locked treasure area. The treasure areas in the eight edge rooms contain different treasures and the one in the centre room contains a ladder to the next level. The player's task is to navigate the maze-like corridors of the rooms to unlock the treasure areas and get the treasure. After all eight treasures on a level have been taken, the player can descend to the next level via the ladder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make the player's job harder, various monsters inhabit the rooms. The monsters start out slow and dim-witted, but become faster and smarter on later levels. Contact with a monster kills the player instantly. In each room, there is a sword, collecting which temporarily gives the player the ability to kill the monsters. After some time, the monsters return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Crystals of Zong,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
