			<description>Blurb from Columbia Games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A H&amp;acirc;rnic Murder Mystery&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A stormy day in early winter. Gusts of wind whip up the powdery snow cloaking Ternu Heath in a mantle of white. A lone group of travelers hurries to a remote Laranian abbey to escape the merciless weather. The powers of fate have chosen them to become involved with a series of violent murders at the abbey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chendy is an abbey of the Laranian Order of Hyvrik, held from the Bishop of Ternula. Someone is killing clerics of the abbey. But why isn't there a corpse to be found after each murder? Are there in fact really any murders, or is someone playing a devious game? Why are the other noble guests of the abbey so chilly and remote? Has the time of the final battle between Larani, the shining guardian of Dolithor, and Agrik, the Lord of the Four Horsemen finally come, fulfilling an ancient dark prophecy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an atmosphere of fear, mistrust, political intrigue, and religious hysteria, the characters must discover the answers to these questions if they hope to survive. Dead of Winter contains detailed descriptions of a Laranian abbey and village situated on the southern edge of the Ternu Heath in Kanday. The complicated political situation in Kanday and the kingdom's difficult relations with its neighbors impact the plot. Gamemasters will find this module a valuable aid when designing further adventures in western H&amp;acirc;rn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
