			<description>A zombie themed Cards Against Humanity. Each round, a player reads a survival scenario from a red &amp;quot;Survival&amp;quot; card, and all the other players answer with their best white &amp;quot;Provision&amp;quot; card(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The leader for each round then re-reads the red survival card and each of the provision cards, and selects their favorite to keep the group moving forward through the apocalypse. The winning survivor holds onto the red apocalyptic scenario card which equals one point.&lt;br/&gt; Continue in clockwise fashion with a new leader reading in each round. Be sure to have 10 provision cards in your hand each round (unless increased or decreased by trump cards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The provision deck includes 8 reanimation cards that players can keep and use to get a new hand, and 2 CDC cards that forces everyone to get new hands. The scenario deck includes 5 double tap cards where two 1-fer scenario cards are drawn and the played provision cards must apply to both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
