			<description>The board consists of a map of Belgium.&lt;br/&gt;Each player is a tourist from a different country and is visiting Belgium. They all start in Brussels and move to a different city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each city they visit, they have to answer a question about the location they're in. If you answer correctly you get a picture of the location or a recipe of a local specialty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to win the game, you have to collect a picture of Brussels, a picture originating from each of the Belgian provinces, a picture of a folkloric manifestation of each of the three different regions and a recipe. If you exit the country at the correct border with all these, you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The production value of this game is absolutely gorgeous - over 200 full color pictures are included with an additional 500 question cards ! A very good way to get to know the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
