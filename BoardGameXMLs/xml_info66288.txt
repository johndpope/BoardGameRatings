			<description>The players will be able to organize keyboard musical-note representations into appropriate chord formations and state the name of the chord sequence correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player has three or four cards forming a chord, the chord sequence is placed on the table. The player must then tell the other players the name of the chord. If correct, this player's turn continues by selecting another card as in step 2. If the player is incorrect, another player may &amp;quot;steal&amp;quot; the chord by stating the chord name correctly.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the most chord formations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;46 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
