							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Destroy All Monsters</name>
									
			<description>Take control of a rampaging monster and destroy other monsters or just crush a city and puny Humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin playing Destroy All Monsters, you need the following things:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A Gaming Board. Preferably with some kind of urban terrain, but use whatever you have.&lt;br/&gt;    2 of 9 Monsters. One per player. These can be of any scale that the players desire, but should be in scale with each other and with the terrain.&lt;br/&gt;    Cotton, for representing smoke, ooze, webbing, or other, less mentionable, substances.&lt;br/&gt;    A Record Sheet for each Monster. These should be prepared sometime before actual play begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pencils, for recording changes to the above mentioned record sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A Vast Quantity of Six-Sided Dice. You're gonna need 'em.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something to Represent Power Points. Small tokens of some sort. Beads or Glass Blebs would be ideal. These will be kept in a common pool, and distributed to individual players&lt;br/&gt;as necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Numbered Chits, and Something to mix them in, so that players may determine when it is their turn to move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To beat all other Monsters present into unconsciousness. And to step on a few humans, while you're at it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
