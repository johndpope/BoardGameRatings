			<description>A trivia game in which proverbs/sayings have to be completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player puts a player token on one of the empty spaces on the board. Players then take turns rolling the die and move their pawn accordingly. If they land on Hein-Bl&amp;ouml;d space, they roll the die again to decide which of the six proverbs/sayings printed on the top card they will have to complete. Their neighbour reads the first part of the proverb/saying on the top card and the active player tries to complete it correctly. If they succeed, they win a winner chip (if on a coloured Hein-Bl&amp;ouml;d space) or a Hein-Bl&amp;ouml;d chip (if on a white Hein-Bl&amp;ouml;d space). Three Hein-Bl&amp;ouml;d chips can be exchanged for a winner chip of the player's choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has collected all six differently coloured winner chips. He/she wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
