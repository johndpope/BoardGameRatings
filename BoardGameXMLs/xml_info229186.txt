							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Xen&#039;drik Expeditions Fastplay Characters - Level 10</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To facilitate rapid play with new players, the organize play campaign promoted a large number of &amp;quot;fastplay&amp;quot; characters built at level 9.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aside from easy use, every fastplay character was keyed to a specific Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Miniatures figurine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player used a fastplay character and that character's specific miniature, a bonus feature was unlocked.  Note that experience points gained when using a fastplay character could be transferred to the player's default character if the fastplay character and the player's default character were the same character class.  Note that most fastplay characters were aligned with a faction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character builds at this level were named, and provided as four-page form-fillable sheets:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Bugbear Rogue/Fighter&lt;br/&gt;        Changeling Sorcerer/Wizard/Ultimate Magus&lt;br/&gt;        Daelkyr Half Blood Ranger/Impure Prince&lt;br/&gt;        Dwarf Rogue&lt;br/&gt;        Goblin Ninja/Assassin&lt;br/&gt;        Halfling Rogue/Invisible Blade&lt;br/&gt;        Human Cleric&lt;br/&gt;        Human Favored Soul&lt;br/&gt;        Human Fighter&lt;br/&gt;        Human Knight&lt;br/&gt;        Human Sorcerer&lt;br/&gt;        Lizardfolk Ranger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
