			<description>Text from the introduction in the rules:&lt;br/&gt;The witches keenly stare at the magic bowl.... in a few seconds the magic symbols will appear. The witches are as quiet as mice and even the cauldron has stopped bubbling. Finally the symbols can be clearly recognized. Immediately the witches yell their magic spells, as only the quickest witch to shout the correct spell will become the new superior witch!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of Haba's Tumble-dice games, characterized by using dice in a domed container, a clever way of ensuring the dice don't get separated and lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The contents of the game are:&lt;br/&gt;- A clear-domed tumbler with seven red six-sided dice (each die with 2 cats, 2 bats and 2 brooms) and one die with one, two or three black dots, or one, two or three red dots on its six sides. &lt;br/&gt;- One orange wooden witch meeple&lt;br/&gt;- 30 cards showing either a scene with many witches or a scene with one witch. The backs of the card show the face of one of three different witches. &lt;br/&gt;- The rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tumbler is placed in the centre and seven cards are dealt face up around the tumbler. The witch piece is placed on any card and during the game only moves in a clockwise direction. The player whose turn it is shakes the dice and all players simultaneously try to see what spell is indicated and which they must recite. The spell to recite is determined by where the witch lands. The die with one to three spots in two colours determines where the witch lands. If it is a card with many witches, the players must recite the spell corresponding to the type of animal that appears the most times on the dice. If it is a card with one witch, the players must recite the spell corresponding the type of animal that appears the least number of times on the dice. The first player to recite the correct spell gets to keep the card that the witch was standing on. The witch then moves clockwise the number of steps indicated on the pipped die and a new card is placed in the space vacated by the witch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to get three of the same witch (on the card backs) or any five witches.&lt;br/&gt; The rules provide for a professional variation, where the colour of the dots, either black or red, on the pipped die makes a difference. The cards have little signposts with a black star or red mushroom. The movement of the witch will then be in the direction of the red star or red mushroom accordingly .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
