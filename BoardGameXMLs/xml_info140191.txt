							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chuggington Top Trumps Activity Pack</name>
									
			<description>A selection of games and puzzles aimed at the very young, using characters from the Chuggington TV series. Altogether there are three different games and 4 puzzles to keep a young mind busy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Naturally, there is a pre-school Top Trumps game with 12 cards. Each train is rated for Speed, Friendship, Adventure and Wisdom and each is illustrated in colour. This will be a short game which is right for the age group - they won't have time to get bored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secondly, you can play Pairs with the cards because there are 12 cards giving a description of each of the twelve trains. So the player won't find an exact match but will be able to find, say, two Chatsworth train cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thirdly, there is a simple which is played a little like Rummy but much easier. You have a hand of five cards and you draw a card (from the stack or the top of the discard pile). If you get a matching pair, you may lay it down and discard one of your other cards on to the discard pile. The first person to get rid of all their cards, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
