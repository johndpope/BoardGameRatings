			<description>(from Critical Hit website:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our Goal: Here come the TACTICS GUIDES&amp;mdash;each aimed at enlightening ATS enthusiasts about a portion of the game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ATS TACTICS GUIDES are for you. Perhaps we should clarify. These publications are for you if you are interested in playing the game the way it was meant to be played&amp;mdash;and becoming an expert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We feel confident you will read these TACTICS GUIDES from cover-to-cover the first time you crack one open.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TOBRUK TANK TACTICS GUIDE covers tank vs tank warfare in the ATS in a brief, readable format. Chock full of examples, it should have you 'getting' the way tanks are to be handled in 15-20 minutes of review.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cupola ring not included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT YOU GET:&lt;br/&gt;A 24-page publication with heavyweight 4-color cover and pages printed on durable 70-lb stock for longevity on your bookshelf;&lt;br/&gt;An Armor Basic Game rulebook;&lt;br/&gt;A sheet of tanks to use with the Armor Basic Game;&lt;br/&gt;An 11x17 4-color Basic Game mapsheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(BGG description:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An analysis of utilizing tank tactics in the Advanced Tobruk (by Critical Hit) - 20 pages and includes mapsheet #2, a counter sheet with German IVF2s and American M4A1s, M4A2s, Valentine IIs, Crusader IIIs, and Deacons - although the rules and charts are more limited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a 4 page insert with the ATS basic rules and player aid card. Could be an interesting tank platoon vs tank platoon wargame, playable on a small 11x17 map and playable very quickly. Might be a good introductory tactical wargame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
