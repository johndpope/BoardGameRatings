							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Army of the Elves</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains stats for both standard OGL play and Feast of Crows unit conversions.&lt;br/&gt;Contains army lists for both 'light' and dark elves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elves are inscrutable, graceful, long lived and knowledgable. Good or evil, light or dark, they bear themselves aloof from the other races and are regarded as untrustworthy, or even downright evil, by many of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elven craft is amongst the finest known, their weapons and armour renown for its accuracy, strength and the delicacy of the artisan's work. No bow is more accurate, no armour lighter, no blade so keen. Their goods are prized, valued, fought for by those of lesser ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their magical knowledge is considerable, honed and fashioned over the long centuries to give them resistance to many magics along with a powerful talent, most especially for enchantments. These enchantments and martial prowess with bows and other stand-off weapons allow the elves to protect their communities, even though they are smaller than those of many other races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When war comes the elven host will often resemble a silvery pool, light glinting from their mithral weapons and armour and a high keening cry coming from their number as they close to the attack. Arrows flying with uncommon accuracy to strike their enemies down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a dark-half though, an outcast race of elves who call the tunnels and the dark home, the ways of evil. Their grace is decadent, their weapons crafted with subtle evil and the silken tones of their voice come from the spinnerets of spiders, not the joy of ancient tales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poison and treachery lurk in the dark but are no less elven than any other?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
