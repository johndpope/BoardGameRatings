			<description>A cork plateau, building blocks and constructions, which must be made up from the blocks - and yet neither  Bamboleo nor Make 'n' Break, but balance and dexterity, because you must balance the cork plateau on your back or your head or your knees and hold the plateau in balance for at least 2 seconds. You draw a card, place the plateau accordingly on head, back or knee and then the buildings blocks as shown on the card. When blocks tumble or the finished construction does not keep for 2 seconds, the card is put back beneath the stack. When the construction has been successfully completed, you keep the card. After the previously agreed number of rounds the winner is the player with most points on his cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
