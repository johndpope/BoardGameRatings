							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rio 1808</name>
									
			<description>The year is 1808 and the prince regent of Portugal, D. Jo&amp;atilde;o VI, has just brought in the capital of Brazil, with all the royal family, his court, employees and dozens of nobles and influential people. rich in Portuguese society. With Napoleon's work all over Europe, this was the only way the Portuguese kingdom could survive to survive and not have to kneel before the French. Now in Brazil, D. Jo&amp;atilde;o VI intends to continue the reign by distributing titles, improving the infrastructure of the Brazilian city and creating a new Rio de Janeiro.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Rio 1808 players assume the role of heads of upward families in Brazil (the Almeida, Magellan, Oliveira and Santos) who seek to be nominated with nobility titles by the Portuguese Crown during the transfer of the capital of Portugal from Lisbon to the Rio de Janeiro. Players are expected to flatter the court by offering various products through their best workers, gaining influence with the regent and other members of the royal family, as well as other important nobles of the period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, players will send their workers to various points of the city to buy certain goods and resources, completing the wishes of the Portuguese court and also assisting in the construction of several buildings throughout the city of Rio de Janeiro such as the Museum, the Library and the Botanical Garden. Players will also be able to hire and teach new crafts to their workers, instructing them and making them more effective in accomplishing the tasks. However, more efficient workers are also more expensive and require better wages. In each round, players receive money from their other businesses, send their workers to the chores, and at the end of the day pay their wages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increasing influence with the court also yields an increase in your income, as the name of your family becomes more valued in commerce and more favored by the nobles. But each time you take some of your workers to increase their influence in court, the court becomes more demanding with the gifts, envying each other and making their task more difficult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the three buildings (the Museum, the Library and the Botanical Gardens) are finished, thus triggering a final round in which players can still try one last move to please court members. The player with the greatest influence at the end will be awarded a title of nobility for his family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
