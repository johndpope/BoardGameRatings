			<description>The zombies are shuffling though the spooky paths of the cemetery in search of brains. Get on this ghastly adventure and try to hoard the biggest amount of brains! But watch out for Dr Bizarre- he will try to steal your brains for his sinister experiments in his freaky lab! This game includes a puzzle-like game board that takes a different shape every time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns spinning the spinner and if they get a colored lantern they move to the next lantern of that color in any direction. If that space is next to a brain token - pick it up and put it in your jar. The brain tokens have 1-3 brains on them, but is not revealed until the game ends. If they get Dr Bizarre they move him to the next purple lantern, and if he comes across any zombies that player loses all of their collected brains. The game ends when a player reaches the goal-space. Then the players turn their collected brain tokens over and the player with the most collected brains wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
