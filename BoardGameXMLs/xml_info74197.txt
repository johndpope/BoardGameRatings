			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COME ON IN AND LOOK AROUND! I'LL BE IN THE BACK IF YOU NEED ANYTHING...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his years traveling the lands with the Company of the Sunset, Luven Lightfinger learned a thing or two about what equipment an adventurer really needs. The average general store can provide a lot of the basics, but Luven and his companions quickly realized that there are many other items that can make life on the road (and crawling through dungeons) easier and safer. When the time came to retire from adventuring, Luven drew upon the lessons he'd learned on the trail and opened a store, catering to those hardy souls who hear the call of the open road as strongly as he did.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part sourcebook, part catalogue, Luven Lightfinger's Gear and Treasure Shop is chock full of new items for outfitting your characters. From weapons, armor and trail gear to potions, oils and kits, Luven's shop has it all. He stocks locally produced goods as well as imports from exotic locales, and he guarantees he'll have at least one item in his inventory that you've never seen before. Interested in purchasing some magic items? Luven keeps his collection of those in the back room. Always ready to help out a fellow entrepreneur, Luven will even tell you all about his shop and how he set it up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one will want to spend all of their reward at the tavern again after stepping inside Luven Lightfinger's Gear and Treasure Shop!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luven Lightfinger&amp;rsquo;s Gear and Treasure Shop introduces tons of new weapons, armor, equipment, alchemical items, clothing items, prosthetic limbs, magic items and many, many more to your PFRPG games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Dozens of new weapons!&lt;br/&gt;     New types of armor, and introducing armor components!&lt;br/&gt;     New special substances, such as tytanite and bronze!&lt;br/&gt;     Dozens of new clothing items!&lt;br/&gt;     New food and drink items!&lt;br/&gt;     New adventuring gear, including dozens of musical instruments!&lt;br/&gt;     Featured on RPG Countdown!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
