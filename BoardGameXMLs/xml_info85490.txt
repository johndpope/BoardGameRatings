							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Powers that be: Councilor Remorga</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by E.N.World community member Fred Wolke (you might know him as Vaxalon, however), and fantastically illustrated by Hannah M.G. Shapero, this PDF details a single member of a magical medieval city council, Lord Visatto Remorga, with his full stats, background, relationships regarding the other council members, roleplaying hints and cronies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Councilor Remorga also has a colour illustrated card designed to be shown to the players, with the character's notes on the back for the GM to refer to. Also included is a map of the palace grounds and first floor, along with descriptions of the grounds and a portion of the ground floor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment&lt;br/&gt;the cover is oriented to be normal Letter dimensions, but the &amp;quot;interior&amp;quot; is done landscape style (with the width being 11&amp;quot; vice the height).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
