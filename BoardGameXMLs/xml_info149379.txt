			<description>This is a free print and play game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life on Earth rides on the back of huge continents, and in the seas around them. Different species are interconnected with one another and influence the habitat for all life. In this game you introduce species (represented by playing cards) to your individual continent.  Each species influences the global temperature, as well as having a preferred temperature range of its own. The individual continents have a unique special ability, playable once per game. The aim of the game is to collect the most victory points by having species on your continent survive Extinctions. This game lets you play out an alternative history of Earth, past, present and future!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
