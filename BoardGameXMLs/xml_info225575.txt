			<description>Rolling Loot was created to participate in the 9-card PnP contest 2017 and won 3rd place in the category &amp;quot;Best 3 or more Player Game&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download it here: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8sSkh8oEQ0GamlHYVBYYkpSREE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8sSkh8oEQ0GamlHYVBY...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rolling Loot is a light pirate themed PnP game where 2-3 player will send their pirate sloops to adventures for their next loot. But they must be quick, determined and lucky to get the treasures before a rival pirate grabs it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards:&lt;br/&gt;There is a scoring card and eight adventure cards in the game. Each adventure card has 3 requirements/steps for a ship to travel along.  If the dice rolled meet the requirements, than a ship can go on an adventure always beginning from the bottom most part of the card.  For a ship to advance further on an adventure card, the dice always must match the next requirement to keep on travelling.  A ship can at any time during the player's turn abandon the adventure it is on and return to the player&amp;rsquo;s ship pool. Most of the requirements/steps have a certain amount of loot the player can grab in the left side of the card. Whenever a player ever grabs the loot from the space they are on, the ship is returned in the player&amp;rsquo;s pool and an unused card is placed in such a way that the amount of loot taken is covered to indicate it is exhausted. &lt;br/&gt;There are 3 levels of cards:  Level 1 &amp;ndash; Adventures with  0 / 2 / 3 loot x3 Level 2 - Adventures with   2 / 3 / 5 loot x3 Level 3 - Adventures with  4 / 6 / 10 loot x2&lt;br/&gt; Setup:&lt;br/&gt;Every player gets their colored tokens (ships) of choice and make a ships pool in front of them and also a score tracker cube and put them near the scoring card.&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the Level 1 cards separately from Level 2 and Level 3 and make 2 little decks. &lt;br/&gt;In a 2-player game turn face up in the middle of the table two (2) cards from the Level 1 deck and two (2) cards from the Level 2-3 deck.  In a 3-player game turn face up in the middle of the table two (2) cards from the Level 1 deck and three (3) cards from the Level 2-3 deck.  These are the current game&amp;rsquo;s adventures that players can go for to get the treasures they offer.&lt;br/&gt;Players roll a die to determine the starting player.  Rest of the game is played clockwise.&lt;br/&gt; Gameplay: (consists of 3 phases for the current active player)&lt;br/&gt;1.  Loot Phase:&lt;br/&gt;Before the rolling phase the ships that have travelled in previous rounds can grab the loot from the requirement/step they are on.&lt;br/&gt;When the loot is grabbed, the ship is returned in the player's ships pool and an unused card is placed in such a way that this amount of loot printed on the card is covered to indicate it is exhausted.&lt;br/&gt;If 2 or more ships are on the same step the loot is split between them rounded down. If the loot is the highest one at that time on the card, than it is split and taken immediately by all the players.&lt;br/&gt;If there is a higher step that can be accomplished the non-active player decided if he wants to take his cut from the loot or keep his ship on the step it is on and let the active player take the whole loot.&lt;br/&gt;When the last available loot is grabbed from an adventure card, all ships on this card returned to players' ships pools and the card is turned face down and is inaccessible. &lt;br/&gt;2. Rolling Phase:&lt;br/&gt;The current player gets the 5 dice and rolls them.&lt;br/&gt;Then he decides if he wants to keep some or all of the current dice results and/or he may reroll any combination of dice twice.&lt;br/&gt;The last reroll dice results must be kept as there are.&lt;br/&gt;The smallest combination that can be used for a requirement is of at least 2 dice*.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    For the &amp;ldquo;no even dice&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;no odd dice&amp;rdquo; steps in the Level 2 cards all unused dice of this round are used to fulfill this requirement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Travel Phase:&lt;br/&gt;After the player decides to stop rerolling or after his last reroll he chooses where he wants to send his ships according to the dice results. &lt;br/&gt;He can send both ships to adventures using the dice results.&lt;br/&gt;Each die may be used only once.&lt;br/&gt;A ship always begins from the 1st requirement/step (bottom part) of the card. &lt;br/&gt;A ship can travel many times during a round.&lt;br/&gt;The ships of a player can be on the same card or on different ones. &lt;br/&gt;Both ships of a player may be on the same card but never on the same step of that card.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Game End and Scoring:&lt;br/&gt;When 2 or less cards remain in game with just 1 available loot step on them, the end game is triggered.  All players will play one last round. After that last round, all the ships on adventures automatically grabs the loot from the step they are on if available. &lt;br/&gt;The player who has the most loot wins. &lt;br/&gt;Tie Breaker&lt;br/&gt;If 2 or more players have the same amount of loot, the player who got his amount of loot first is the winner.  &lt;br/&gt;To keep track of who got first the x amount of loot, when there is more than one player in a loot space place the scoring cubes one on top of the other to indicate the order of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
