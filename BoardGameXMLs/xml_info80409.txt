							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sorcerer&#039;s Apprentices</name>
									
			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game the players are apprentices to a mighty sorcerer. They live with him in his mansion on the edge of a small town. Today he is out on business and has entrusted the apprentices to finish a magical potion he is brewing in his laboratory. Normally this would be an easy task but yesterday the sorcerer caught the apprentices doing something bad and as a punishment he transformed them all into animals. The apprentices' only hope of being transformed back is to skillfully finish the magical potion in time. Failure is not an option but it is not easy gathering ingredients or working in a laboratory when you are in the shape of an animal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
