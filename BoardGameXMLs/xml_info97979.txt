			<description>From Publisher Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fraction Whirl I, a one-of-a-kind game, unravels fraction complexities by using colorful cards and a user-friendly fraction slider. Fraction Whirl I is fun, quick-paced, and easy to play. The game is perfect for classroom instruction and home learning activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The distinctive Fraction Whirl I cards - with standard fraction notations in addition to groupings of dots, blocks, and pie shapes - help players understand the relationship between different fraction representations. While the cards whirl around the table, players try to collect 4 matching fraction cards and be the first to quickly grab a Whirl token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trick? Players need to keep their eyes on both the cards and the tokens. Need help with the answers? The Fraction WhirI I slider is always there to help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
