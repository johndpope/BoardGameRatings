			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War Stories: Prophetic Dreams is a transmedia setting enhancement for Contagion Second Edition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Contagion is a dark and terrifying place. On the surface, it looks much like the world you and I live in. Just beneath that surface, in the shadows, rages an ancient conflict between supernatural factions who all seek dominion over the Earth and control over the souls of humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some rare people are gifted with supernatural insight into future events. These Prophets see the future in strange flashes and hazy visions. Some see their visions as a gift or blessing, using their insight to perform heroic deeds and prevent tragedies. Others turn their foresight into a tool for personal gain and profit. Some poor souls never accept the true nature of their visions, burying their insight with medication and therapy, mistaking their power for mental illness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War Stories: Prophetic Dreams focuses on the story of one Prophet in particular, a young woman named Cassie Koizumi, who has just recently begun experiencing visions. Feeling compelled to document her experience, Cassie begins a video blog where she recounts her dreams and insights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War Stories: Prophetic Dreams includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A 12 page setting enhancement detailing new feats and a new Psychic Power for use with psychic characters.&lt;br/&gt;    Biopgraphical information and a pregenerated character sheet for Cassie, the character featured in War Stories: Prophetic Dreams.&lt;br/&gt;    A short film/video asset to be used as an in-game prop/story aid by the Gamemaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
