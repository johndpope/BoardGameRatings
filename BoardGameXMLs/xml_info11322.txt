			<description>Las Vegas Wild is a cross between Scrabble and Poker.  There are 106 tiles with card faces on them (two full decks plus two jokers).  The board is 13x17 spaces and has 14 cards printed on it - matching the correct card to the space scores a bonus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is in poker hand terms: pairs, two pairs, three of a kind, full house, etc.  If you can't make a play on your turn, show your hand, dump all your tiles, mix them in and draw seven new ones - your turn is now over.  Otherwise you play tiles to the board, counting score for both vertical and horizontal poker combinations.  As in Scrabble, every play to the board must create a legal combination in all directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to, but with different details in components and rules, the game Deal Me In.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
