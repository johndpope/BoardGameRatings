			<description>Major League Baseball is a sports video game released in 1988 for the NES. It is notable for being the one of the first video games licensed by Major League Baseball, although it was not endorsed by the Major League Baseball Players Association. Without the backing of the player's association, the game could not use the actual names of the players, although it was able to use their numbers, thus accurately portraying the contemporary teams and their rosters. In doing so, it became the first baseball game for the Nintendo Entertainment System to carry official Major League Baseball licensing and lineups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Major League Baseball (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
