			<description>Jabokni is a word game where two or more players draw playing pieces and place them on the board to form words. The first three playing pieces decide the order of the players and form the &amp;quot;word bank&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player, in turn, draws one playing piece, places it on the board and declares a word. The player scores one point per letter of the word declared. The other player(s) each declare a different word and score one point per letter of the declared word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play then passes to the next player and play ends when there are no more playing pieces left to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jabokni consists of a board and fifteen articulated playing pieces. The playing pieces are designed so that any two playing pieces can be put together to form at least one word in the English language. The only other rules are that the playing piece laid must touch on at least two edges, the words declared on any one turn must use at least one letter from the playing piece last laid and that if the playing piece laid results in touching sets of half octagons, then the words declared must use at least one letter from each set of half octagons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
