							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Celtic Warrior</name>
									
			<description>From the game itself:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More moves than chess - fewer rules than draughts/checkers. A game that could almost have come from the Bronze Age itself - when the Celtic Nation was at its most powerful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game of Celtic Warriors employs an ancient method of entrapment know as &amp;quot;Custodian Capture&amp;quot; , a ploy which dates back many thousands of years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first impression of the games is something like a chess/checkers hybrid. More checkers than chess though. Two players face off, trying to reduce the opponent to just one game piece, thus winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
