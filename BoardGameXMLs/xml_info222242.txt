			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, you are a hitman, an assassin who eliminates targets for anyone paying the right amount.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether your skill is stealth, approaching your enemies unseen, firing a bullet from a neighbouring rooftop, hacking automated defences or demolishing a building to eliminate everyone inside, you are always in demand. You might be new to being an&lt;br/&gt;assassin, or you might be a grizzled veteran about ready for retirement. None of this matters to the Assassins&amp;rsquo; Guild; only that you can complete the job and your team are assigned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the protection of the Guild, you need not fear retribution once you escape the scene of the crime - the scrubbers have your back. Every trace of you, every piece of camera footage, everyone who will testify that you were there will vanish without a trace. As a result, joining the Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Guild was never a hard decision for you, even with the possible downsides...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
