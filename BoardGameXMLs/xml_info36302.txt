			<description>&amp;quot;Card game for 2+ players. Each player controls a tribe (Band) of primitive human Foragers.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with a custom deck of cards. There are eleven types of cards in the deck: Hardship, Hunting/Gathering, Food, Strength, Persons, Hand-to-hand  Weapon, Ranged Missile Weapon, Defense, Tactics, Raiding, and Special Cards. Hunting Cards are played to gather food. Hardship Cards are played on other tribes. Raiding Cards are used to launch attacks on other tribes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional sets of generic cards, or markers, are used to track the quantity of people, food, and prisoners in each tribe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The most primitive player goes first.&amp;quot; There are two ways to win: if your tribe reaches a population of 30+ people cards, or if you eliminate all opposing tribes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
