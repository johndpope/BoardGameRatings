							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ordo Veritatis Recruitment Handbook</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ordo Veritatis Handbook has been written to provide players the opportunity to further detail the backgrounds and abilities of their OV operatives in The Esoterrorists roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The majority of this document presents a selection of professions and careers from which an OV operative could have been recruited from. These rules allow players to examine their characters background prior to their involvement in the Ordo Veritatis. This in turn enables for specialised Investigative abilities, and acquisition of expert resources available only to those with certain training and knowledge. In addition, this book also introduces various other benefits a character might receive from being recruited into one or more of the OV operations branches. All of the above represent the specialised training and experienced gained from operating with the Order&amp;rsquo;s structure prior to commencing field work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the mechanical structure of this document is based on the Trail of Cthulhu system of Occupations and Special Bonuses. It is highly recommended that, if the options presented herein are used, that all characters gain access to them &amp;ndash; to ensure balance and fairness amongst the group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
