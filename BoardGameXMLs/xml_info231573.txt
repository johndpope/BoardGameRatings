							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arkham Noir: Collector Case #1 – The Real Leeds</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're a writer, sure, but that doesn't pay the bills, so you got a private investigator's license off the internet. Now someone who claims to be from the FCC has hired you to look into a pirate radio station broadcasting obscenities from somewhere around Leeds, Massachusetts. Growing up near Leeds, you heard all the rumours: leeches, witches, cannibals, strange gatherings in the woods, and dead people on the radio. &amp;quot;You're local, you won't stick out.&amp;quot; Only, the last guy they sent didn't report back. Police are unlikely to be much help: dozens of people disappear every year, adults and kids, and no one says boo. Happened to your cousin when you were a child.&lt;br/&gt;Driving into town, thinking about lunch, her voice comes on the radio to read the station ID: &amp;quot;You're listening to WXXT. The murmur in the heart of Leeds.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As private investigator Matthew M. Bartlett, you will investigate events based on the stories Rangel, &amp;ldquo;If He Summons His Herd&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Little Leeds&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;The Investigator&amp;rdquo;, and many others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arkham Noir is a solitaire card game inspired by the interconnected stories of H. P. Lovecraft and other authors, re-imagined as noir detective stories. Each case stands alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay consists of adding cards to open cases, creating lines of investigation in an effort to solve them. The ultimate goal is to score five &amp;quot;puzzle&amp;quot; clue cards in order to piece together the big picture before running out of time or mental stability. Each newly shuffled deck is the start of a unique challenge, with adjustable difficulty levels to accommodate all level of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
