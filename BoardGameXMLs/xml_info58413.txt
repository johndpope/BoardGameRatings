							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chris Wheeler Role-Playing Conography</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chris Wheeler&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;18th September 1968 - 26th July 2009&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'ROLE-PLAYING CONOGRAPHY'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book has been complied to celebrate the creative role-playing life of Chris Wheeler. It contains a list of his known games run at conventions and home campaigns since he started writing for cons in 1989.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There have been many contributions for his friends who co-wrote  with Chris or just enjoyed playing in one of his games over the years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout this book you will read a wide range of anecdotes and memories of events that surrounded his game or a convention as remembered by friends. Of course some references may seem esoteric to the reader, but it is hoped that in a small way it provides a sense of how Chris profoundly inspired fellow gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chris Wheeler was not only a prolific game designer but also an amazing story-teller who always ran outstanding campaigns for his friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
