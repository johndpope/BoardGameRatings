							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Moony&#039;s Seaside Game</name>
									
			<description>Moony decided to go to the seaside for the day. Here is a jolly seaside game for you to play with your friends. You need counters - small buttons will do - and a dice. At some of the spaces there are things that happen to Moony on the way to the seaside. Remember, he can change into anything just by thinking about it! You have to do what the words in those spaces tell you. The first player to get to the seaside, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in the Playhour Annual, 1976&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
