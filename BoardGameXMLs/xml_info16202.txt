							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Over the Edge Football</name>
									
			<description>Over the Edge Football is a tabletop game.  Remember playing paper football in school?  Well, now you have an electronic triangular unit that simulates the football.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You still push it back and forth over the table, but the unit keeps score, times the quarters, and even has voice and stadium sounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you turn the unit on, lights will let you know who has possession of the 'ball'.  To score a touchdown, the unit has sensors underneath that will register when it goes over (but does not fall off) the edge of the table.  Each side has four downs to score a point before a turnover occurs.  It also has a special setting for field goal attempts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
