			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Motion Pictures is a card game that uses a hand management mechanism with strong set collection and deck building elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, we have several available projects for the players to compete in.&lt;br/&gt;Every turn a player can choose between three actions: shoot, hire and recast. &lt;br/&gt;While shooting, a player places a filmmaker at an available project. If a project's requirements are met the player places the completed project in his score pile. &lt;br/&gt;When hiring, a player takes an advanced filmmaker into his hand from the advance row by discarding another filmmaker of the same specialty. Advance filmmakers have multiple skills and special abilities.  &lt;br/&gt;Using the recast action, a player can draw a new card from his deck by discarding any one card from his hand.&lt;br/&gt;The four types of projects have different requirements. &lt;br/&gt;Movies need skills, based on their difficulty. Tv series need a defined number of skills while excluding some in particular. Commercials need specialties, not specific skills, whereas awards need exactly the skills shown on them and nothing more. Finally, there is also the trilogy in which all players can place filmmakers in secret during the course of the whole game and gain fame at the end according to the skills played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a project is completed it is replaced by a new one from the upcoming projects pile. When the pile is depleted, players play a last round before the era is completed. The game ends after four eras and the final scoring occurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a light to medium game, equally suited for families and gamers, and is recommended for players 12 years old and up. Two to four players can have the unique experience of managing a movie studio and each game lasts about forty minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
