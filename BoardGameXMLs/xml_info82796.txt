			<description>Mystery Case Files: Dire Grove is the sixth instalment of the Mystery Case Files  franchise and was released December 11, 2009. It had its first release on November 25, 2009 as a Collector's Edition. It follows the events of four graduate students who travel to a small township near Blackpool, England. They were never heard from again as they went missing in Fall 2009. The game follows on from the previous game, Return To Ravenhearst, but does not directly lead into the Ravenhearst story-arc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mystery case files&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
