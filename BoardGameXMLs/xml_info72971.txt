			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ms, do your players think they?ve seen it all? Do they know the stats of every creature in Core Rulebook III by heart? Have they begun to grow weary of many of the &amp;quot;Stock&amp;quot; monsters in your fantasy gaming sessions? Then, it's time to try something different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Book of Templates is a supplement featuring thirty (30!) new creature templates for the d20 System?, ranging from subtle to bizarre. Breathe new life into the very creatures your players have come to take for granted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each bookmarked template comes complete with plenty of d20 crunch and just enough flavor text to spark the imagination to new heights - thought-provoking templates that can form the seeds of a new scenario, adventure, or even an entire campaign. Every template also features a complete example of how it is used - that's thirty templated creatures ready to go right &amp;quot;out of the box&amp;quot;! And the file is so compact, you can put the whole thing on a floppy disk and take it with you anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Try the Book of Templates. Your players will never know what hit them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
