							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Golem</name>
									
			<description>Golem won the 2004 About.com Board/Card Games / Abstract Games Magazine Shared Pieces Game Design Competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take the role of wizards vying for control over a golem loose in the city. Golem features a unique shared-piece mechanic in which the players bid for control of the golem's movement, trying to harvest charms and foist curses upon their opponents. Along the way, players may gain control of powerful artifacts, such as the Amulet of Loki, that can change the game in an instant. With its modular board, Golem is never the same game twice. Golem features the haunting artwork of Niklas Brandt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, each turn consists of the following phases: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     allocation&lt;br/&gt;     orientation&lt;br/&gt;     movement&lt;br/&gt;     harvesting&lt;br/&gt;     regeneration&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have 20 units to allocate per turn (to orientation, movement, harvesting, and regeneration). Points are earned for harvesting charms. Play continues until one player reaches 30 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
