			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever said &amp;ldquo;work smarter, not harder&amp;rdquo; probably didn&amp;rsquo;t have you in mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Without lifting a finger you can move objects about, from tiny stones to massive boulders, or crush the bodies of those that would harm or impede you. You can transmit your thoughts over great distances, and force your way into the minds of others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s just the beginning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With time and experience you can hurl objects about with great force, and tear people asunder. Or maybe you&amp;rsquo;d prefer to delve deep into their memories and claim them for yourself? Who knows, you might learn a trick or two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It all depends on what you have a mind to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains two files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first is a digest-sized, 25 page book laid out like the Dungeon World rulebook. It contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The psion playbook: move objects and beat monsters up with mind bullets, communicate telepathically, and hear the thoughts of others.&lt;br/&gt;    20 advanced moves that let you move larger objects with ease, knock enemies about, communicate telepathically with multiple creatures at once, defend yourself through sheer willpower, impose your will on others, take moves from others, and more!&lt;br/&gt;    New gear and loot: weapon and armor enhancements, psychic capacitors, preservation jars (for storing brains), psionic poisons, and a few new magic items.&lt;br/&gt;    A behind the scenes look at our design, expanded explanation of some of the moves, and five additional advanced moves that just wouldn't fit on the sheet.&lt;br/&gt;    The other is a 2-page, letter-sized character sheet with custom graphics for you to print and play with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
