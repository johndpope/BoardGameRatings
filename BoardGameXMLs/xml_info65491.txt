			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Democracy Falls &amp;ndash; a hub of opportunity for those in the Cursed Earth with the skills, gear and guts to try and survive within its gang-patrolled wall. Located a few hundred miles west of Mega City One on the ruins of one of America&amp;rsquo;s ancient heartland capitals, &amp;lsquo;D-Falls&amp;rsquo; is a dream for Cursed Earthers&amp;hellip;and a nightmare to the Justice Department. It has always loomed in the distance, standing as a reminder that the Mega Cities are not the only civilisations to thrive in this day and age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Justice Department has always turned a blind eye to the existence of Democracy Falls, choosing to use its resources more efficiently than laying siege to it. The appearance of a new criminal game in the lower blocks has changed the status quo, forcing the Chief Judges to take action. This new game, called Bloodrace, is well-known to have started in Democracy Falls...and it just claimed its first Judge&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the Justice Department needs a small team of Judges willing to leave the safety of Mega City One to bring justice to the Bloodrace organisers- those who brought the game to MC-1&amp;rsquo;s streets. Everyone is allowed to enter Democracy Falls, even Judges...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...the only problem is getting back out again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Democracy Falls is a scenario for the Judge Dredd: Traveller game setting, placing several Judges in a dangerous and foreign city in the Cursed Earth, where fast cars and faster bullets are normally the Law of the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
