			<description>translated from the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep inside the world of Ethra or only reachable through strictly guarded gates there lies the mystical hollow world of Tharun with its multi-colored sun in the center and its vast, global ocean. Gods and giants wrestle since the birth to this world and its ancient secrets, and for some of them it is their last resort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Tharun reign the Swordmasters. As Guarei they may oppress the people at the behest of a ruler or rob it as bandits called Brigantai - they have one thing in common: They are virtuosos of the art of fencing, and they know no mercy in the exercise of their art. While the Swordmasters own everything, the farmers and fishermen have nothing - they are born to obey the ruling caste and serve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Night gods control the fate of Tharun, whose sacred laws guard people against the unspoiled wilderness of the islands, their beasts and monsters, and against the manifold dangers of the mighty sea. The priests of the Eight, the Azarai, tolerate no argument and no other faith, and their temples and shrines adorn the fairytale palaces and forts of the island lords and Archipelares. All the sciences and arts as well as magic lies in the hands of selected castes like the seafaring Numinai, the legally qualified Zinakai and the magic-wielding Sombrai.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nine large island kingdoms with hundreds of small islands form the populated part of the world, and all of their lords pay a tribute to a legendary Overlord: the Tharun! On top of the highest giant mountain he receives the grace of the gods, chosen to rule over the nations of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this volume we present the world of Tharun in detail. Discover the history and mythology of the hollow world, experience the hierarchical social orders and learn the principles of religious cults of the eight known gods. We take you on a tour of the Nine Kingdoms and their various cultures and conflicts, will introduce special personalities, power groups and places and reveal mysteries and secrets. Above all, we open up a world that was lost for many years in the dark, and can now be discovered again and filled with life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
