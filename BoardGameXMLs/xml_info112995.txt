			<description>The Battle of Nations - 14-19 October, 1813&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Napoleonic 20 #16 (Germany 20 #7)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What began at the Battle of Dresden and continued to unfold on battlefieds across the German States including Kulm, Dennewitz, Grossbeeren, Gorlitz, and the Katzbach River, have all led up to this. Four Allied nations, and their four armies are converging on Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s Grande Arm&amp;eacute;e as it falls back to its supply base at Leipzig. More than a half-million soldiers will stand and face eather other over these fateful days, which are now yours to command in this epic installment of VPG's venerable Napoleonic 20 series. The Battle of Nations awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring a strategic scale with corps-sized units and mult-hour game turns, play moves smartly across this, the largest single game map in this series. Helping to tell the narrative of this great battle are new types of Event cards and the inclusion of Strategy cards allowing players to choose their pre-battle disposition and set their overall plan. This tense-and-ever-growing meeting engagement will require skill and strategic sense to master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innovations to this game series include the addition of Leader units, whose command span shows the limits of leadership over such a sprawling battlefield. Also, to show the prolonged effects of keeping troops committed to battle, a simple Fatigue system has been added to keep players thinking about reasting their weary forces over the multiple days of the fighting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Data:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complexity: 5 on a 9 scale&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Suitability: 4 on a 9 scale&lt;br/&gt;Scale: Each unit is 1 corps, each hex is about 1000 meters, and each turn is roughly 3.5 day hours (or 10 night hours).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    One 8-page, color instructions booklet, with Standard and Optional rules included&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    One 6-page sheet of Exclusive rules&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    96 color, die-cut 5/8&amp;rdquo; mounted game pieces&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    28 color, die-cut 5/8&amp;rdquo; markers&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    24 Event cards&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    One 22&amp;rdquo; x 17&amp;rdquo; color game map&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Four color player aid sheets&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Polybag packaging and component storage&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
