			<description>Mickey Mouse: Magic Wands!, known in Japan as Mickey Mouse V: Mahou no Stick (ミッキーマウスV 魔法のステッキ, lit. &amp;quot;Mickey Mouse V: The Magical Stick&amp;quot;), is a 1993 puzzle/action game hybrid developed and published by Kemco in Japan on December 22, 1993, while it was later published in North America by Nintendo in May 1998. It is the sixth game in Kemco's Mickey Mouse-based video games in their Crazy Castle series  and the only one to be released in North America under its original title. The Japanese version was originally just a Game Boy game, while the North American version features Super Game Boy support. It was played by one player only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game had simple graphics, music and animation, even for its time. The companies left a million-seller logo on its box cover and label(actual sales of this game are currently unknown). After that, though, it became very obscure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mickey Mouse: Magic Wands!,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
