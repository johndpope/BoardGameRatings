			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;L'Aigle d'Or is an exploration game by Louis-Marie Rocques. The goal of the player is to explore a castle in Wesphalia in order to retrieve the famed Golden Eagle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player must fire buy supplies (torches, crowbars, healing potions or ropes), then sets out to explore the castle. It is a huge place, so drawing a map is advised. The game displays the character and the room he's in in fake 3D. There are traps to avoid, chests to open, ghosts to defeat, and specific items like keys to gather in order to complete the game. The game is entirely keyboard driven. There is a light RPG touch in that the player must manage his inventory and his hit points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First released for Oric Atmos machines, it was later ported to several other platforms, including Thomson MO-5 and Amstrad CPC. It was a huge hit when released in France, earning the 1985 Best Adventure Game award (&amp;quot;Tilt d'Or&amp;quot;) by French video game magazine Tilt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
