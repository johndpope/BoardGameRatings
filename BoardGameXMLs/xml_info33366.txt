			<description>Game subtitle (translated): &amp;quot;Who needs enemies when you got neighbours?!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heibelwijk is a game focused on neighbourhood troubles. The occupants of 4 houses are in a constant state of nagging, annoying and badgering each other, to ultimately become the last inhabitant of the game's particular quarter of town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a player you have to choose which other player or players (your neighbours) you are going to pester and therefore target, and which neighbour(s) you tactically choose as your very, very best 'friend'. Following the right (social) tactics and strategies are very important in this tiny world of irritation (with an actual irritation board) and friendship. In the end it's up to you to use the commotion, beleaguer, revenge, lucky and disaster cards in the right way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is best played with 4 players, but 2-player rules are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
