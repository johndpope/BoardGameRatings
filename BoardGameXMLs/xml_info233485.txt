							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cosmic Odyssey: Service Bots and Synthetic Companions</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm completely operational, and all my circuits are functioning perfectly &amp;mdash; how may I serve you today?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t want a robotic sidekick to join them as they traverse the stars? Well, Cosmic Odyssey: Service Bots &amp;amp; Synthetic Companions has you covered!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cosmic Odyssey is a line of Starfinder Roleplaying Game compatible products designed to give you, as both a player and as a gamemaster, all the tools you need to fully explore a classic motif of science fiction with new character options, equipment, and vessels, as well as a location and NPCs. Designed to be dropped into your existing game, or to serve as a starting point for your adventures, each Cosmic Odyssey is ready-made for action. In Service Bots &amp;amp; Synthetic Companions, we bring you all the rules you need for building your very own robot pal as well as several pre-made Service Bots, or SBs. These synthetic companions exist in a space outside the fully-autonomous android race and the advanced machine companions of the mechanic class&amp;rsquo;s drones. Instead, our SBs are robotic companions for everyone (that can afford them). And, rather than just generic rules, an entire corporate world of competing manufacturers with different goals and ideals &amp;mdash; as well as of course designs &amp;mdash; is presented to provide gamemasters with a rich tapestry of backdrops and plot hooks, as well as to give players more flavorful companions then just a string of letters and numbers for their robotic buddies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
