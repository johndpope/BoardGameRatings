			<description>TouchMoney Game is an educational game designed to teach young children how to count coins.  It is a roll-and-move game where students land on spaces that challenge them to count coins correctly, either from pictures on a card or from coins randomly drawn from a tray of plastic coins on the board.  Players get five points each time they count correctly.  Play ends when a player reaches a certain predetermined number of points or players have circled the board a number of times.  The winner is the player who has earned the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
