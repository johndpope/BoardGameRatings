			<description>Released in the magazine Spielerei No. 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives 6 playing pieces of the same color, representing the sheeps and a differently colored playing piece, representing a dog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With help of their dogs the players try to chase the sheeps into their enclosure. The sheeps start the game on their starting spaces. The dogs are in their kennels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player's turn consists of two actions: Firstly, he moves his dog one space in any of the eight directions. Secondly, he moves all sheep standing on one of the orthogonal or diagonal lines away from his dog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player with all his sheep in his enclosure wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
