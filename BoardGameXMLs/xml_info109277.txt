							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bisca</name>
									
			<description>The Bisca is a Portuguese variant of Briscola.  Like that other game, each player is dealt 3 cards and another one is turned up as the trump suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fist to play can play any card he wants to, but the second needs to play a higher card from the same suit previously played or a card of the trump suit to win a trick. The winner of each trick replenishes his hand first and a player owning a 7 from the trump suit can &amp;quot;rescue the bisca&amp;quot;, taking to his hand the card turned up in the beginning of the match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The total points in each game is 120 and whoever has the higher scoring wins. Playing with 3-6 players just takes a few minor adjustments to the rules or cards and the versions for 4-6 are played with partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The point system goes as follow:&lt;br/&gt;Aces - 11 points&lt;br/&gt;Fives - 10 points&lt;br/&gt;Kings - 4 points&lt;br/&gt;Queens - 3 points&lt;br/&gt;Jacks - 2 points&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing with a traditional spanish deck of cards is recommended but not mandatory, and the point system follows the same structure, with the &amp;quot;cavaleiro&amp;quot; (knight) card replacing the queen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is usually played with a hand of three cards (Bisca de tr&amp;ecirc;s - literally three's Bisca), but there are two variants:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bisca dos Nove (Nine's Bisca) for a hand size of nine cards;&lt;br/&gt;Bisca dos Sete (Seven's Bisca) for a hand size of seven cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
