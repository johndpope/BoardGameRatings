			<description>Fast Words is a very fast game to form words, where you have 8 letters and a theme, and have to decide a word that relates to the theme, using as many letters as possible and do it the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A word about &amp;quot;something with a lot of hair&amp;quot; ... What you thought? Or another about something that &amp;quot;has holes.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A pile of theme cards is placed on the center of the table surrounded by 8 cards with one letter in each one. When showed the first theme card players have to find a word on the theme that have at least one of the showed letters. Who founds put his hand over the theme pile, say the word and takes all the letters contained in it. The rest of the players plays the same way until only one player has no said any word. Then, letters are replaced and a new theme is showed. Player with most cards at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
