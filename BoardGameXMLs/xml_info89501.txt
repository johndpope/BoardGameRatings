							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gryphon: Mercenary for Hire</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Gryphon&amp;rdquo; is a streamlined Kestrel-class escort refit for use in freelance mercenary operations. Meant to serve as a mobile base of operations for a small team of specialists-for-hire, it is able to fill many different roles. It can take the team into dangerous areas, fight its way out, and provide a place to rest and recuperate on the way to the next job. At 175 feet long this progress level seven ship comes in at just under 2,500 register tons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gryphon is the perfect ship for a small team of mercenaries or fortune seekers. Though it can be flown by a crew of two (or even one in a pinch), Gryphon has individual cabins for six. There is a holding cell for use in bounty hunting, a hidden cargo area for smuggling, and a brand new ship's boat for going planet-side in style. With a pair of turreted plasma cannons, a missile launcher, and integrated engineering/computer control room - the ship is ready when things get rough. Its sleek lines and dark exterior will leave a lasting impression on friends, foes, and clients alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     15 page PDF file detailing the ship, interior areas, and crew.&lt;br/&gt;     Open Game License stats provided for the vessel and crew, as well as the series-10 &amp;quot;Comet&amp;quot; which serves as the ship'/s boat.&lt;br/&gt;     Map Book&lt;br/&gt;         Full-color 14 page PDF file containing complete interior maps.&lt;br/&gt;         Includes miniature-scale maps for tactical combat.&lt;br/&gt;         Miniature-scale composite map of the ship interior.&lt;br/&gt;         A poster-sized, 24x36 inch, 150 dpi, color JPEG image.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
