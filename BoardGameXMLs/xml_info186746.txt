							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Omega Basic Rules</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in Omega have eight Attributes:  Body, Coordination, Presence, Mindpower, Agility, Intelligence, Perception, and Wizardry.  Attributes have a numeric rating from 1-8.  Each Attribute is linked to two Skills.  Skills have a Skill Level of 0-12.  Skills also have up to three Modifiers:  Area of Expertise, Expert Bonus, or Specialty Bonus.  The Skill Value is the sum of its linked Attribute and the Skill Level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attribute numeric ratings are purchased from a point pool.  Characters may &amp;quot;earn&amp;quot; some points by taking a Special Handicap.  Skills Levels are purchased from a separate point pool.  Again, characters may &amp;quot;earn&amp;quot; some points by taking a Duty or Flaw.  Skills can be increased and must also be &amp;quot;maintained&amp;quot; by occasional expenditure of points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skills are used in Skill Resolution where the GM assigns a Difficulty Level from Routine to Absurd, representing 1 to 10.  Characters roll that number in a dice pool, sum the dice, and subtract their Skill Value.  The final result is compared to a Skill Action Table to determine outcome.  Opposed actions work the same way but the Skill Action Table results are considered Intermediate.  Both Intermediate results are compared on a second Action Table to determine the overall result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
