			<description>A 2-3 player boardgame variant of Tetris. Published in a Danish book about Boardgames. Many of the games are known games like Chinese Checkers, Checkers, Halma, Othello and others. But this game is an invention of the author. Like all the other games is basically a DIY game, in that you get the rules, and the layout of the board, but have to provide or create our own board and counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play Textor you will need to make 7 different counters, each in 7 duplicates, and a board (10x20 squares). The counters are placed in a bag. First player draws one counter and places it on the board along to &amp;quot;bottom&amp;quot; edge. After that each player takes 2 counters and places them just like tetris-bricks would fall. Each time a player makes a line across, that player scores 1 point. The game is over when a player can't place a tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
