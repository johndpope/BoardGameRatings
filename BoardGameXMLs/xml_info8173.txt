			<description>BATTLESHIP is a game of the maturing dreadnought. With the Washington Naval Conference and its resulting treaty limitations on ship numbers and tonnages, the battleship went completely over to 2nd generation designs, including all the major conversions, and then the final burst of 3rd generation dreadnoughts.    Meantime, also as a result of the treaty, a now type of warship, the heavy cruiser, came to the fore and began a progress still unfinished in the modern missile cruiser. These events through 1945 are covered by BATTLESHIP.  The game system was designed to reflect the concept of the Immune Zone, around which capital ship design revolved. This zone is roughly represented by the medium range defense value. But since when this value will come into effect is a result of the characteristics of the opposing player's guns, you must conduct your movements to, whenever possible, be in your immune zone while your opponent is being fired on at either long or short range. It is within these margins that damage can be done in safety.  A hint: learn to use escorts. Properly handled they can shape an engagement early by threat of torpedo action.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Battleship (second edition)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
