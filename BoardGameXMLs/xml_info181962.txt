			<description>Drillernauts is a pick-up and deliver game wherein rocket ships outfitted with giant drill bits smash into distant, ore-rich planets in order to mine their precious resources--imagine that your gaming table is the surface of such a planet. A deck of tunnel cards depicts the subterranean void left behind by the drilling ship as it burrows deep underground. Meanwhile, robot miners (controlled by talented robot pilots such as yourselves) emerge from a hatch at the rear of the ship and venture outward. As the game unfolds, the stream of tunnel cards will become longer and longer, stretching across your table. The drill ship can be advanced in any direction you wish, so long as the tunnel does not intersect itself.&lt;br/&gt; Object of the Game: As robot pilots, players use dice to move their robots through the tunnel, pick up ore, and deliver it back to the ship. Space bucks are scored for each ore cube brought back, with big payouts earned for multiple ore of the same type. The pilot who earns the most space bucks before the end of the game (at which point the ship will resurface and return home) is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
