			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four of you, Arla, Jack, Tirlas and Rachel have been on the trail of The Wicked Man of the Wood for the past eight days now. Since you first heard reports of sightings of this ghost, you have learned that it has existed here for as long as anyone can remember. It is always abroad around the new moon of each month but is never seen at any other time. Further, you have learned that it is a corporeal spirit that has some unique power to attract its victims. You don&amp;rsquo;t know what the power is, because no one has survived it. Your skills served you well, and Arla deduced that the Wicked Man must have a focus, or lair, in the vicinity of Cerlimieu, a small village of 800 people in eastern Dementlieu. You came to Cerlimieu and began further investigations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
