							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Burrito Bison Revenge</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After escaping from Candy Land, Burrito Bison realized he had lost his wallet there. So he returns to claim it. Same gameplay as the original launch from the ropes of the ring and squish as many gummies as you can before running out of speed. Buy upgrades with your earnings to extend playtime. This version includes additional upgrades and has a survival mode so you can try to get as far as you can in an unlimited environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
