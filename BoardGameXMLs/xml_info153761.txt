			<description>This is a horse race and the winner is the one who is the first to reach the finish line. Each player has 3 meeples (horses). There is no die to determine the movement of the meeples. Instead each player gets 3 wooden disks. At each turn each player choses between 0 and 3 disks, which he hides in his closed hand. All players reveal their disks at the same time. Each player moves one of his meeples according to the sum of the number of his own disks and those of the player on his right side. If a meeple lands on a space with a red dot, it has to start again (There are a lot of red dots!). If it lands on a red cross, it is eliminated from the game. Landing on a green space means that the meeple has prematurely reached the finish line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
