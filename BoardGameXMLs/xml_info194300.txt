							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Project Baikal</name>
									
			<description>Project Baikal is a dynamically collaborative village-building eurogame inspired from tower defence video games.&lt;br/&gt;It is a family-friendly card game for 2 players, 10+ y.o. and one hour in length.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players need to balance threats and opportunities, short term and long term, to come up collectively with the best possible action plan every turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theme&lt;br/&gt;The dark winds of war, famine, plague and catastrophic weather have swept the planet, almost scouring it clean of humanity. &lt;br/&gt;One small enclave still survives though, in a village on the bank of the Lake Baikal in Siberia.&lt;br/&gt;From such humble beginnings the human race can be reborn. And not make the mistakes from the past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your friends are the villagers, keeping out the remnants of the old world and nurturing the hopes of the new. &lt;br/&gt;You will protect the village from wolves, mercenaries and internal pressures like racism and corruption. &lt;br/&gt;You will welcome strangers with needed skills, grow your village and rebuild civilisation anew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;From 4 locations, bad events (dust storm, wolf pack, disease, etc) slowly progress towards your newly-formed village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To defeat those events before they do damage, you will:&lt;br/&gt;- Collect value cards (fight, protect, trick, research, stop and care),&lt;br/&gt;- Move to locations (forest, lake, mountain and road) and&lt;br/&gt;- Encounter those events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also acquire good events (dog, old couple, family, etc) who will help to build useful buildings (watchtower, hospital, etc) using gathered resources (wood, stone).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have 10 turns to complete 5 buildings and win the game!&lt;br/&gt;But beware: you can lose instantly if your village takes too much damage!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acknowledgment: Theme written by Ian Triffit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
