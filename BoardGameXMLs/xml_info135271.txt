			<description>Tiledeck is a game system created in 2012 by Néstor Romeral Andrés.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiledeck is basically an extended regular deck of cards made of black acrylic tiles, and created to last longer that cardstock. The tiles are laser-engraved and painted. They are 9mm thick, so they can be placed standing up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 60 tiles in 4 colours (yellow, red, green, blue). Each colour has 15 tiles numbered from 1 to 15, which means 2 more tiles per suit than a regular deck, so it can accomodate more players in games like Big Two. Any card game playable with a regular deck can be played with Tiledeck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, each tile has been binary coded on its perimeter, by adding 'gates' to some or all of its edges. This opens the path for future games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Green tiles also have a little spot so that colour-blinds can distinguish them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
