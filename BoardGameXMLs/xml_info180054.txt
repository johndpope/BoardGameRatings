			<description>Sumoku by Blue Orange Games&amp;trade; is a unique crossword-style game with numbers. Players add up tiles to multiples of the key-number shown, connect them, and that is Sumoku! Each line of unbroken tiles (both columns and rows) must be a multiple of the key number. For example if the key number is 5, then the set of tiles must total 5, 10, 15, 20, etc&amp;hellip; But a tile may not match the same color as another tile in that line of unbroken tiles (row or column). Points are scored for each tile played and the other tiles that form the new line of unbroken tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hager Apps chose to release the Apps using the Freemium model. For a payment ads shown after playing a Game Center turn can be turned-off. An additional feature face-to-face play for 2 to 5 players by passing the device can also be unlocked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
