							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lingual</name>
									
			<description>Lingual is the name of the game as well as the arch nemesis in this interactive iPad application designed to effortlessly teach multiple languages to beginners. This educational app will submerse beginners into the world of Lingual where they will be taken on a journey to learn the language of their choosing. With flash card-like methodology, each journey teaches language through audio and written word. Each journey will also allow users to learn culture and geography while they receive surprises from Lingual himself as he hovers in his hot air balloon above all game play. Set to release in December, the initial language offerings will be English, Mandarin (Simplified Chinese) and Spanish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
