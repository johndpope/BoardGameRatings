							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Beggars Divide Game</name>
									
			<description>This game is a game that tests the ability of players to evaluate proper on how much they give away pointwise in order to insure that players come to them to gain points, so by giving away points, the player has people coming to them to get points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core of the mechanics is that in a set order (unless playing simultaneous turns) a player will pick another player to beg to.  The player being begged will divide up a set number of points between them and the begging player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues a set number of rounds with the player with the most amount of points winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
