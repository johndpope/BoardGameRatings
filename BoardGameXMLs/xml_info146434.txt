							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">It&#039;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Whimsy World!</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Born in 1901, Milton Elias &amp;quot;Milt&amp;quot; Whimsy revolutionized the entertainment industry with his loveable cartoon characters and family-friendly, big-screen adaptations of classic fairy tales. By the time he was 54, he had amassed both a personal fortune and a sterling reputation, and he controlled an international entertainment corporation that produced movies, television shows, and stage plays. When he opened the first of his Whimsyland theme parks in 1958, his fortune and reputation grew even more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unknown to almost everyone, Whimsy was a powerful wizard from the 7th Dimension. He used transspiritism to enter the 3rd Dimension and be born as a human in order to escape the machinations of the Dark Lord Geoff Ratzenbourg, whose perverse evil threatened to turn the 7th Dimension into Ratzenbourg's personal hell. Whimsy used his magic to weave a benign enchantment throughout all his creations, encouraging people's natural inclinations toward kindness and joy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disaster struck both Whimsy and the 3rd Dimension in 1966 when Ratzenbourg burst through the dimensional barriers to attack Whimsy at the ribbon cutting for the joyfullest place on Earth, the amazing Whimsy World. In a barrage of soulsearing necromancy, Ratzenbourg ripped all of Whimsy's attractions from across the globe into a specially constructed prison zone in the 7th Dimension. Tens of thousands of people visiting Whimsy attractions found themselves trapped in a twisted realm constructed from theme parks, movie theaters, resorts, playhouses, and shopping malls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
