			<description>The time is late 20th century.  The kings of the royal family, including those of the Canary House, are very fond of melon.  But so are the queen, princess, and everyone else who works for the house such as chef, housemaid, vicar, and jester!  So a war over a piece of melon starts every day in the house, as well as among the royal houses.  Who on earth will be lucky enough to get a melon in the end?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another Japanese import.  There are character cards, four event cards, and point cards.  The box says it's an homage to Alex Randolph.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
