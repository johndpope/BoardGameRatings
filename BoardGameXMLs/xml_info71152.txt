			<description>Published 1985 by &amp;quot;Hahn&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The object of warfare is to win control of your opponents government. To do this you must capture any two of his &amp;quot;JEL&amp;quot; pieces. JEL represents Judicial, Executive, and Legislative branches of our government. Lose one JEL piece and your country can still function, but lose the second JEL and you lose control of your government and the war.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warfare is an abstract strategy game similar in play style to stratego or chess with players taking alternating turns, where they may move, attack, or retreat (though there is no secret unit deployment as with Stratego). To win one must capture two of the opponents &amp;quot;JEL&amp;quot; pieces, which also have the ability to move and attack. The playing pieces are of various military and civilian ranks (JEL, Secret Service, General, Admiral,Army, Nacy, Airforce, and Marines). Each has a particular set of rules in how it can be moved, how far, or under what conditions/direction it can attack. Black squares on the game board represent land, while white squares represent water. Certain pieces may only move or attack on either by virtue of their class (Navy can only move/attack on water, while army can only move/attack on land).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
