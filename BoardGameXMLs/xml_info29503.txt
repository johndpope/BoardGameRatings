			<description>In addition to being a normal deck of cards, each card pictures av device from a James Bond movie (like the Q boat from &amp;quot;The world is not enough&amp;quot;, or the Marine Scooter from &amp;quot;Thunderball&amp;quot;) or James Bond himself (Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card also denotes unique values for six variables for the creature on the photo (Damage, Protection, Ingenuity, Stealth, Technology and Multi-purpose). Each player play their top card, and the starting player selects variable. The player with highest value wins the card and is the next rounds starter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game separates from other similar card games by having a secret message (e.g. name of next mission card) on the back of every Bond-card, only visible when seen trough a red plastic lens, which goes with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
