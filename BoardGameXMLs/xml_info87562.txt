			<description>PvP is a quick 20-30 min, 2 player fantasy card game where players use teams of combatants to try to be the last man standing!&lt;br/&gt;The game is easy to learn and play, offers many interesting challenges and replayability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to wipe out all of the opponent's characters. Each character can only take a certain amount of damage.&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players roll 6 Six-sided die three times, keeping any number of die between each roll. At the end of the third roll, players assign dice to characters they control. Each character has abilities which correspond to specific die combinations. (Eg. Fireball requires a straight, a strike requires a pair, etc...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters are divided into teams which provide special bonuses if at least 2 members of the same team are present. Each of the 12 characters possess unique abilities. Advanced rules allow for customization of character teams, allowing endless re-playability!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more info on motivation behind the game, head over to&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.indiegogo.com/PvP-A-card-and-dice-iOS-game?a=476297&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.indiegogo.com/PvP-A-card-and-dice-iOS-game?a=4762...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
