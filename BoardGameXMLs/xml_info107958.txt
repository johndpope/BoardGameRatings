			<description>Quorsum is an abstract, strategic racing game for two players.  The goal is simple enough: move your tokens to the opposite corner of the 4x4 board.  Quorsum is unique, however, in that the board is never the same from game to game; rather, the 16 board tiles are picked at random before the game, so that players must constantly react to an unexpected setup.  Not only that, but the board continues to change throughout the game, as players try to flip key tiles from light to dark or vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luck is minimal: even the dice require skill, since players may decide how many of their dice to use for each important move.  The result is a fast-paced game in which players must constantly calculate the best path to take and the best way to hinder the opponent's tokens.  Although the experienced player will usually win, still there is often a chance for both players right up until the last move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quorsum avoids both the predictable setup of most strategy games, and the swings of luck in most dice games.  The players' fate, therefore, is always in their own hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
