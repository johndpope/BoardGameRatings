							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ATS: Briefing #3</name>
									
			<description>The third ATS Briefing, the first in many years is loaded with invaluable resource material for Advanced Tobruk System enthusiasts.&lt;br/&gt;The 48 page issue, laid out in color, contains several new articles, such as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Buildings as targets, with a handy table to assist decision-making&lt;br/&gt;     The Finns in WWII&lt;br/&gt;     Obstacles and demolition&lt;br/&gt;     Scenario design&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that's not why you called!  This issue also includes a new suite of Busting The Bocage scenarios along with a remastered Pointe du Hoc map, printed on heavy cardstock.  AS a bonus, the magazine includes a full-color replay of one of the new scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;Additionaly, the ASL-comp chestnut &amp;quot;The Grain Elevator&amp;quot; is here for ATS players to enjoy, complete with cardstock map and scenarios to play on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ownership of the ATS rules, playaids and system markers is required to make use of this material, as well as combat counters from Berlin: Red Victory and at least one ATS Normandy title, such as D-Day Rangers or Band of Brothers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
