							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wheaties Sports Trivia Game</name>
									
			<description>A sports trivia game that celebrates 75 years of General Mills' Wheaties cereal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to score as many points as possible in Divisional, Conference, and Playoff rounds to get to the Winners Circle.  Once in the Winners Circle, players vie for the Championship Ring.  Points are scored by correctly answering trivia questions on tennis, golf, football, hockey, auto racing, baseball, the Olympics, basketball, and a special &amp;quot;All Champions&amp;quot; sports section that touches on nearly every champion and sport known to man.  Along the way you try to obtain strategic advantage by landing on Playbook spaces.  If you are lucky you get some draft picks, pick-up season-making free agents, figure out a team game plan, or make trades for the stretch run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
