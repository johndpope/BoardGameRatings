			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you celebrate Christmas, Hannukah or Chrismahanukwanzakah, most can agree that &amp;ldquo;the most wonderful time of the year,&amp;rdquo; is often the time we&amp;rsquo;re least thankful for. Between fighting families, re-gifted fruitcake and Black Friday frenzies, most of us end up on the naughty list once the holiday antics are over&amp;hellip; Don&amp;rsquo;t get your tinsel in a tangle anymore! Introducing the gift that keeps on giving, Humanity Hates The Holidays: The Adult Party Game Santa Won&amp;rsquo;t Bring You.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humanity Hates The Holidays is the perfect distraction that will take you away from holiday hell this year. Compatible with Humanity Hates Trump, Humanity Hates Hillary TOO!, Cards Against Humanity and other similar party games, this hilarious expansion pack will have the family in stitches. Humanity Hates The Holidays pokes fun at clich&amp;eacute; Christmas music, Jewish Christmas traditions and Thanksgivings that even the Pilgrims would cringe over. Play it around the Thanksgiving table or at your holiday parties, heck, you may even bond with your crazy aunt over this!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similarly to Cards Against Humanity, each player is dealt 10 white cards, each including a word or phrase. Each round, players take turns serving as the judge, drawing one black card containing a question or fill in the blank sentence. Players answer the question or fill in the blank sentence by choosing their favorite white card to fill it in. Each player takes turns judging, choosing their favorite option and the funniest answer wins the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humanity Hates The Holidays includes one Ultimate Yule Log Card. The lucky player who has the card in their hand automatically wins the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
