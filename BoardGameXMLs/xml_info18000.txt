			<description>THE WINE GAME - A superior drinking game which will increase your appreciation of wine and will provide a very entertaining evening for 2-8 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A delightful journey through vineyards, wine tastings, wine bars, wine parties.  You may be lucky enough to take the Gourmet Wine Tour, the Grand Tour or the Mini Tour.  You will glide effortlessly around the board, answering a question or two about wine (Red - hard, White - easy) and being asked to take a drink or two from your glass, which always seems to replenish itself.....&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to move around the board collecting bottles of wine.  The first person to collect a case (i.e. 12 bottles) is the winner.  By answering questions correctly you will keep moving around the board giving you greater opportunities to collect bottles...and to take more drinks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
