							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The City of Talon</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city of Talon is a crowded, cramped, bustling nexus of business and travelers. No struggling outpost, this; civilization has firmly taken root in this portside city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And that's the problem. Merchants wrestle over a few extra coppers' profit, while the nobles (most of whom were merchants not long ago) vie for power. Filty urchins clog the streets of the Bullrushes while the penitent file into dusty temples, and nobles while away their time and money at secretive clubs like the Knife's Point. There are vast opportunities for profit in Talon, some legitimate and many planned in shadow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Talon is a sandbox setting, appropriate for any fantasy-style game. It's urban but medieval/Renaissance in technology; general enough to be easily inserted into any pre-industrial setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this document, you get 27 separate locations in the city, each described in detail; 34 NPCs, each with a personal motto, background, and defined personality; 10 full-color maps; 2 pages of campaign and quest ideas; and a solid understanding of Talon's history, physical location, major vices, organizations, political situation, etc. Of the 34 NPCs, the most important 14 have been completely and separately statted out for the D&amp;amp;D 4E, D&amp;amp;D 3.5, and GURPS systems. You also get stats for henchmen in the D&amp;amp;D 4E system appropriate for levels 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, or 25.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 107-page PDF contains a portrait version of the text (50 pages) for printing, and a landscape version (57 pages) for reading on a laptop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
