			<description>This card came consists of 6 suits of cards; Red, Blue, Green, Black, Yellow, and Orange. Each suit consists of 8 cards, with point values from 1-8. Each of the 8 cards also have images of camping-related items on their faces, one such image per card, with no duplicates in each suit.&lt;br/&gt;There are also 3 &amp;quot;wild cards.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus the deck consists of 51 cards, and each card has a color, point value from 1-8, and image. (with the exception of the 3 wild cards)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to collect a set of cards that meets one of the following criteria:&lt;br/&gt;A) 7 cards with the same color borders (suited)&lt;br/&gt;B) 6 cards with the same image (which requires one from each suit)&lt;br/&gt;c) 60 points worth of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wild cards can be any color or item, but will always be 0 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hand size is 8 cards. On a player's turn, they may either draw a card from the deck and discard from their hand, or offer a trade with another player. Hand management is important, as is tracking what other players are trying to collect in order to block them if possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
