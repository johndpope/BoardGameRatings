							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1st &amp; Goal: Northeast Division</name>
									
			<description>1st &amp;amp; Goal: Northeast Division, an expansion for 1st &amp;amp; Goal, contains 28 dice which make up 4 custom teams. The Dice Football League (DFL) Northeast Division includes the following teams:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Boston Bombers - The Bombers enter the league with the 9th ranked running game and the 20th ranked passing game. Despite a lopsided offense, the Bombers have a top twenty defense. Coach Pete Sapalla states, &amp;quot;We&amp;rsquo;re pretty good on the ground, I expect us to roll through most defenses and slice &amp;lsquo;em up.&amp;quot; Leading rusher Pat Riot commented: &amp;quot;Coach has some revolutionary new plays that give me a lot of liberty on the field.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Manchester Marauders - The Marauders enter the league with the #1 ranked running game and the 10th ranked passing game. Despite a strong offense, the Marauders have a less than stellar defense. Coach Frank Merrill states, &amp;quot;We&amp;rsquo;re going to put up a heckuva fight this year. We don&amp;rsquo;t have much support in the air department so you&amp;rsquo;ll see a lot of emphasis on the ground game.&amp;quot; Star running back Hugh Mungus commented: &amp;quot;Just give me the ball.  I&amp;rsquo;ll find a way through the lines. &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Newark Nighthawks - The Nighthawks enter the league with the 21st ranked running game and the 18th ranked passing game. Despite a weak offense, the Nighthawks have the #2 defense. Coach Mack Aroni states, &amp;quot;Sometimes I get a little cheesed off at our half baked offense, but our defense? Boy are deze guys good. No meatballs on that squad.&amp;quot; Defensive end Bubba Ganooj commented: &amp;quot;We can take whatever the opposition dishes out. I&amp;rsquo;ll mash up anybody who gets in my way.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Rochester Rockets - The Rockets enter the league with the 20th ranked running game and the 3rd ranked passing game. Despite an uneven offense, the Rockets do have a top ten defense. Coach Red Glare states, &amp;quot;We have a really explosive passing game. Our new quarterback can really launch it.&amp;quot; Quarterback Rocco Gibralter commented: &amp;quot;Thanks to me and my arm, we have a pretty solid offense this year. I pretty much stay in the pocket and fire.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
