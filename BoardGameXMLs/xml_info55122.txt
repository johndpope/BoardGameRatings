			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the heart of one of the ancient necropolis, a sooty, cracked, sagging network of factory buildings rises from the bones of a long-dead industrial quarter. Here, towering chimneys covered in ash rise like broken pillars of some ancient monument, casting deep solid shadows across the ruin of rubble and human remains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the center of the cratered, crumbling quarter, the complex of buildings is slowly being rebuilt. But by whom, no one knows. Wild men from the peripheral regions of the vast ruined city have been driven off, their curiosity sated by laser fire from the metallic sentries that patrol the factory&amp;rsquo;s perimeter. Lone scavs, wrapped in heavy scarves and wearing thick goggles to protect their eyes from the sun, who would otherwise be drawn to any sound disturbing the dead-quiet of the inner city, are staying away, spreading rumors of an army of the &amp;ldquo;metal gods&amp;rdquo; being reborn at the city&amp;rsquo;s heart. Traders, set up in small tent towns on the outskirts of the once-fabulous necropolis, dealing in scrap and baubles found by the scavs who brave the interior regions of the radiated sprawl, are afraid of what these revelations might mean for the future of their fragile way of life&amp;hellip; The following is meant to flesh out just one possible adventure location involving rumors and stories of the return of the &amp;ldquo;metal gods&amp;rdquo;. In specific, this encounter area covers a reactivated robot production factory, which in this case has been brought back online by a particularly powerful and charismatic android commander, a survivor of the Final Wars. Revived and reborn, he, his assassin lieutenant and other followers, have gathered a mass of robots, automatons, and simple-minded organic &amp;ldquo;thralls&amp;rdquo; from the ruins to build a new army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Army Rises is intended for 4-6 characters of about 7-9th levels. This adventure was previously presented in Metal Gods (first edition).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
