							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brain Slugs from Planet X (Savage Worlds)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you are about to read is a treatment of B-movies as translated into Savage Worlds. These pulpy, campy adventures formed the seeds of movies and books and cartoons that we all know and love. This  particular adventure was writen for Fabled Environments&amp;rsquo; Kickstarter for their Average American High School map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When we thought of offering a great module using the Average American High School map, we turned to our friends at Silver Gryphon Games, who rose to the occasion. So many B-movies involve high school kids, high school teachers, or high school labs and when Silver Gryphon Games was presented with the opportunity to craft an adventure for our friends at Fabled Environments, we jumped at it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get ready to jump into the middle of a classic B-movie with this amazing module complete with typical high school archetypes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
