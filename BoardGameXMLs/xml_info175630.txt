							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ironcast</name>
									
			<description>Inspired by Victorian era science fiction writers such as H.G. Wells and Jules Verne, Ironcast is set in an exciting alternative history; a time when refined men and women in top hats and bonnets commanded gigantic walking war machines, laying waste to the enemies of the British Empire! Players take control of a 7 metre tall walking vehicle called an Ironcast. They must face off against an invading force of enemy Ironcast in order to defend 1880's Victorian England.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles are fought by generating resource nodes which in turn drive the Ironcast's various weapons and systems. Players must choose how to spend these nodes wisely, either offensively in order to cripple and destroy their opponents, or defensively, if they suspect a barrage of incoming weapons fire is due.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn based strategy combat set against a rich and interesting alternate 1880's history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roguelike campaign mode where death is permanent but with persistent rewards from one game session to the next. Drive back the invading forces and press forth for victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Completely hand painted art style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by the steampunk genre and Victorian science fiction.&lt;br/&gt;Loot new technology and upgrade abilities from the wrecks of fallen enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Customise your Ironcast with a range of unique weapons and defensive systems. Over 50 different unlockable items will ensure an almost limitless number of combinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Passive boosters allow players to augment and tweak their Ironcast's weapons and abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
