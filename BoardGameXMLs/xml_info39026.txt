			<description>Bilderschlange (Picture Snake) matching game by Selecta is similar to a cross between a jigsaw game and dominoes.&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is for children to find a picture that matches with a picture on a tile already played.  As play continues, the row of pictures grows slowly. Encourage storytelling during play.  The clown needs his umbrella, the tower needs a roof and the moon needs the sun.&lt;br/&gt; Picture Snake matching game requires children to think logically developing cognitive and reasoning skills. Picture Snake is manufactured in Europe by Selecta Spielzeug and consists of 20 large wood tiles (2&amp;quot;x4&amp;quot;) with beautiful painted pictures. In step with Selecta's history of quality, this game is of excellent quality featuring hard beech wood and child safe finished surfaces that will withstand years of children enjoyment!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
