							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Darkness &amp; Light: The Vorlon and Shadow Fact Book</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intelligent life is ancient in this universe. Before the Earth and the Sun congealed out of space dust, there were races travelling between the stars in shining ships. Living beings heard the echoes of the Big Bang reverberate off the cosmic spheres. Alien voices sang as the stars of this galaxy were born. These beings eventually found life developing on a hundred worlds. Not wanting to be alone, they nurtured this burgeoning life. Slowly, over millennia, more sentient beings evolved and took their first steps towards the stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These races would become the Vorlon and the Shadows. Unfathomable years later, they would be as gods to the Younger Races. One embodies the principle of chaos. The other purports the rule of order. Darkness and Light, each as terrible and powerful as the other, locked in an aeon-old struggle for dominance of the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside You Will Find&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History &amp;amp; Technology: Full histories of both races, told from both sides of the moral divide, and the fantastic details of their technological advances - and how they work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First One Servants: All the many types of Vorlon and Shadow Agent are detailed within, along with their major client races, such as the Drakh, the Ru'Harus, the Ascori, and the Zener.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters: Full rules on playing a Vorlon or Shadow character!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realms: From the Vorlon Empire to the Shadow Dominion, all the major client worlds of both races are reviewed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Snowball': A deadly adventure that pits Player Characters against an insidious Shadow plot destined to throw a race into chaos...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
