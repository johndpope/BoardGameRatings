			<description>Old Fritz: One Brain Cell Army Level Rules for the Seven Years War In Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Excerpts from the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;These rules were first devised some considerable time ago as an alternative to the mainstream of tabletop figure wargames, to find, through a different approach a radically faster method for calculating the results of inter-unit combats.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;So, perversely, I decided to design a game that allows a few players to fight battles, in a reasonable time and without the need for very large numbers of brain cells on the part of the players.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The results of combat can be arrived at by reference to a single combat results table giving who won, how decisively they won, and the casualties inflicted, in one fell swoop.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Each bound represents approximately 10 minutes on the battlefield . . . The ground scale is 1mm = 2 metres . . . Each figure represents between 50 and 60 men.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units are controlled by written orders. The implementation of orders is delayed to reflect the time required to convey them to unit leaders. The rules encompass various aspects related to infantry, cavalry, and artillery units. Supply and logistics are represented in an abstract manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
