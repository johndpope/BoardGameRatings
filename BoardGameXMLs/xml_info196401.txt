			<description>Game manual&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday, Ruff Rodgers was a normal, happy-go-lucky eight year old, with a&lt;br/&gt;spring in his step and a penchant for shiny marbles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, he's transformed into a ruthless, sadistic killing machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was the Summer holidays, and Ruff scampered out of his house, and up the&lt;br/&gt;road  to  the  park.  He enjoyed it there because it had loads of different&lt;br/&gt;places  to  play,  not like his Mum's garden with its clipped lawn and tidy&lt;br/&gt;flower  beds.  And anyway, he could show of his brilliant marble collection&lt;br/&gt;to the other kids there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This  particular evening, though, there was nobody else in the park.  As he&lt;br/&gt;walked through the gates sunlight dimmed, as though a storm was coming; and&lt;br/&gt;suddenly the sky was filled with black clouds.  A strong wind picked up and&lt;br/&gt;whistled  through  the trees, creating...  well, an interesting atmosphere,&lt;br/&gt;let's  put  it  that  way.   For added effect, it also rustled up some dead&lt;br/&gt;leaves  from  the  ground  and showered them in all directions.  This would&lt;br/&gt;have  unnerved most people, but not Ruff.  He'd seen all this kind of stuff&lt;br/&gt;before,  mostly  when he was daydreaming in a boring History lesson, and he&lt;br/&gt;was  ready  for  any  nasty  things that might come for him from out of the&lt;br/&gt;woods.  It was then he saw it; just a glimpse out of the corner of his eye.&lt;br/&gt;A  bright  light, shining into the trees from just across the other side of&lt;br/&gt;the path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He padded carefully towards it, holding his heavy bag of marbles tightly in&lt;br/&gt;both  hands, ready to swing it into action should anything horrible appear.&lt;br/&gt;As  he drew closer, he noticed that the source of the light, a tiny hole in&lt;br/&gt;the  ground,  was  marked  with  an equally tiny sign, which read:  WANT TO&lt;br/&gt;PLAY?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An arrow pointed towards the hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ruff  looked  around, just to make sure that nobody was playing tricks with&lt;br/&gt;him  (and  so  he didn't look stupid to any of his friends, of course), and&lt;br/&gt;then  knelt  down  before  the  light.   Reaching his hand into his bag, he&lt;br/&gt;pulled  out a marble:  a big, red shiny one; his favourite kind.  Carefully&lt;br/&gt;he  aimed  towards the hole, and fired.  Plop!  The marble rolled down, out&lt;br/&gt;of sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Almost  immediately there was an unearthly roar from under Ruff's feet, and&lt;br/&gt;the  ground  began  to shake violently.  Still kneeling, he started to sink&lt;br/&gt;into  the  earth, and he tried - too late - to get to his feet.  The ground&lt;br/&gt;collapsed, and he fell into a brilliant white light.  Ruff landed, heavily,&lt;br/&gt;in  a  tree-lined  cave.  He rubbed his grazed knees and elbows, and looked&lt;br/&gt;up.   Curiously, the hole he had just fallen through had disappeared.  Even&lt;br/&gt;more  strangely,  his  bag  of marbles had gone; and a large gun lay nearby&lt;br/&gt;with a note attached to it.  The note read:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;`Master  Rodgers,  I'm  afraid  i've  had  to confiscate your marbles, dear&lt;br/&gt;fellow.   I'm incredibly evil, you see, and I need them to power my supreme&lt;br/&gt;machine which will help me take over the world!  Ha ha ha!'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sudden clap of thunder made Ruff jump.  Bloody theatrics, he thought, and&lt;br/&gt;then read on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;`But  because  I'm  a  sporting  kind  of chap, I've decided to allow you a&lt;br/&gt;chance  to get your marbles back.  Grab the gun, climb into the teleporter,&lt;br/&gt;and  you'll  be  taken  to my secret netherworld.  Of course, you've got no&lt;br/&gt;real hope:  even if you get all the marbles, I'll just have to kill you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yours  evil-ly Doctor Destiny' &amp;quot;Oh yeah, you and whose army?&amp;quot; shouted Ruff,&lt;br/&gt;to nobody in particular.  As though in answer the note continued:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;`PS.   Er,  my  army,  actually.   I  built  them  myself.  I call them the&lt;br/&gt;Tinheads, and they're programmed to blow the pants off anybody who tries to&lt;br/&gt;come  and  take  the marbles away.  Especially you, of course, my dear boy.&lt;br/&gt;To rise to my evil challenge and face them, climb into my clever teleporter&lt;br/&gt;and prepare to meet your Destiny!  Ta-ta.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Almost  immediately  he read the words there was a blinding flash, and when&lt;br/&gt;the  smoke  cleared,  before him stood a bright metal box - a sort of steel&lt;br/&gt;phone booth.  A door in the side opened, revealing another sign:  IN HERE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He'd  never  heard  of theso-called `Doctor Destiny' before, but already he&lt;br/&gt;was  building up an intense dislike for the man.  Anybody who calls himself&lt;br/&gt;such  a jumped-up name must be a bit of a megalomaniac, he thought.  And in&lt;br/&gt;all  the  movies,  it's always the megalomaniacs who eat their words in the&lt;br/&gt;end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Confused,  but  annoyed  that  the rotten git had taken his prized marbles,&lt;br/&gt;Ruff  scooped  up  the  gun  and  ammo,  swung  them over his shoulder, and&lt;br/&gt;clambered  into  the  teleporter.   How  tough  can these Tinhead things be&lt;br/&gt;anyway?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
