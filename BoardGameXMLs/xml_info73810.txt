			<description>&amp;quot;Battlefield: Bad Company (also known as Bad Company and abbreviated to BF: BC) is a first-person shooter developed by EA DICE, released in the U.S. on June 23 2008 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game was hinted at just before the release of Battlefield 2, and then announced sixteen months later. A sequel, Battlefield: Bad Company 2 was released on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows on March 2, 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bad Company puts the player in a fictional war between the United States and the Russian Federation, where players will lead a squad of soldiers fighting Russians, MEC (Middle East Coalition) troops and Legionnaire mercenaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game applies some new features to the franchise, including an environment that can be almost entirely destroyed, besides the very basic supports of buildings and certain metallic structures like antennas, and a single-player storyline. The single-player campaign and some multiplayer maps take place in Europe, the fictional Eastern European country of Serdaristan, and an unnamed fictional Middle Eastern country, in a city called Sadiz, which is located somewhere on the Caspian Sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players can hold one primary weapon which each has its own secondary, along with grenades and other picked up explosives and devices. The health system is different than most games. Damage to the player is shown by an out of 100 point system. Players need to heal by using a system of strategically (placed by a medic) health satchel which give health to those nearby. The environment is almost entirely destructible, but bullets cannot go through most walls. The ammunition system uses a bullet calculator, shown on the HUD, and players can endlessly repair vehicles with power tools unless they are completely destroyed. Airstrikes and Mortar Strikes can also be utilized.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Battlefield:_Bad_Company,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
