							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Expedition: Famous Explorers â€“ Travel Tickets and Hazard Cards</name>
									
			<description>A deck of Travel Tickets and Hazard Cards was included with all Kickstarter copies of Expedition: Famous Explorers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5 Hazard Cards - On a player's turn he may spend a ticket to have another player draw one. The drawn card goes either face up or face down in front of the player who drew it (depending on what is drawn). Players may only force a player to draw one hazard card per game. The card will most likely hinder the player in a limited way, usually for one turn, but there will be one card that gives the player a benefit. Using this deck is optional. Players may use the advanced rules to add more ways to spend tickets. Players then become more careful about how they spend tickets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;30 Travel Tickets - The base game will have tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, miniatures were part of the Kickstarter exclusive content. They are listed separately as a board game accessory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
