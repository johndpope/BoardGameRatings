			<description>Scenario description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting for this modular town adventure is Sontra, a port village at the head of the tide on the east coast of of Dor Provence. Sontra straddles the falls that serarate the Upper and Lower Flowmarch. The area above the bluff is the old village dominated by its 400-year-old keep; that below the bluff is the new village, encouraged to grow because the land there has been free from baronial taxation for the past 40 years.&lt;br/&gt;  Several plots are intertwined in the village on Sontra. The most obvious is a press gang that operates from the slum area north of the Kingsway. A part of this scenario is depicted on the cover of this product, and it is the party's first encounter with the village, designed to involve them with the module. By the time the party members have solved this porblem, they have been introduced to a shady character who is trying to take over the barony form his failing and widowed aunt; this involvement introduces them to the village's real threat, the power-hungry cable-pull operator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
