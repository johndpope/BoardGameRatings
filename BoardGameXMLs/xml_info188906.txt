							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Escape from T-Rex Island</name>
									
			<description>Four exploration teams are racing to get back to their base camp on an uncharted island. Behind them is a furious &amp;amp; hungry T-Rex. The teams must get the crews to the base camp as soon as possible before they become dinner of the beast. They also need to get enough food to feed the survivors or people will start to fight for food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escape from T-Rex Island is a quick family game for 2-4 players. Each player controls three teams of survivors but only two actions may be taken each turn, so a player must choose which team to move. On the way back to the camp, players may encounter other fearsome dinosaurs like raptors &amp;amp; pterosaurs. Players must avoid the dinosaurs while collecting food &amp;amp; weapons dropped from the victims. Besides, players may take valuable dinosaur pictures for bonus scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each turn, a player has two actions. You may play an action card to move a team or to take a picture if available. You may also spend an action to draw a card from the deck. But beware. No more than four cards can be held in hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has 3 teams back to the camp. Then players score VPs for survivors &amp;amp; dinosaur pictures. The player who scores most VPs wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
