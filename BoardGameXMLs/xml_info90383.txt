							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Return to Blacktooth Ridge</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Blacktooth Ridge lies far to the east and north of the Crusader States of Ephremere's making. This long, snake like ridge is fabled for its string of abandoned fortresses, treasure houses, temples and underground mansions. It invites many an adventurer seeking fame and fortune. It is an altogether dangerous place tainted with the evil of the Horned One and those who still worship him in hidden caves and temples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Return to Blacktooth Ridge offers up two more encounters on that fabled landmark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nargulf's Reavers: This band of vicious humanoids led by Nargulf the Hobgoblin set out from Aufstrag to slay the rogue leader of the Red Caps. But he has found himself outnumbered in a country on the verge of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wizening Branch: This fabled tree is older than ought else in the Barren Wood and rumors speak of its unforgiving evil, and it unimaginable wealth. None have seen it that have lived to tell the tale. In the words of old man Nester: &amp;quot;Avoid it I say, don't seek her out or it'll gobble yers up, heart and soul. But mind ye, them fey folk of the Barren Wood, they hid up their treasure at the feet of that old tree and there be mounds of it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
