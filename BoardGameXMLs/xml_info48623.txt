			<description>The Back Cover:-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Help Wanted&lt;br/&gt;Kill-crazed assassins.&lt;br/&gt;Arcanomorphic abominations.&lt;br/&gt;Chimpanzee cyborgs.&lt;br/&gt;Rogue demons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you want fries with that, mister?&lt;br/&gt;Or just a little death on the side?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get off the playground, buddy - the big kids are here! Adrienne Hart. Nine Cuts. Homo Omega. The Thing With 1,000 Tongues.&lt;br/&gt;We're talking world-class heavy hitters, ripped bleeding from the world of the Shadowfist collectible card game and smacked&lt;br/&gt;down right into your campaign with full stats and stories. Good guys, bad guys, what's the difference? They're all gonna kick some ass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Too tough for you? No sweat. We got your mooks right here, pal. Shaolin Monks. Buro Tactical Teams. White Disciples. Plenty of low-rank losers&lt;br/&gt;that'll go down like wet cement - maybe. See, they all got a little something special to share: big cojones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not a people person? We got real estate for you, too. El Primo feng shui sites, ripe for the taking. We got your Ancient Temple,&lt;br/&gt;your Wall of a Thousand Eyes, your City Square. Attune to one of these babies and get a taste of real power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Giving up? Want to start life over fresh? We've got new character types for you, too. Magic Cop. Medic. Thief.&lt;br/&gt;Plus more, and new unique schticks to customize the types you've already got.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think this all sounds like a big snooze? Peel them peepers, pal, 'cuz we've also got the lowdown on Operation Killdeer&lt;br/&gt;and the Triumvirate's plot to rule the Netherworld.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In other words, no matter what you buy this book for, you'll keep coming back to it. Back for enemies, back for allies,&lt;br/&gt;back for sites, back for stories. Grab that fork, ya chow hound, and come Back For Seconds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
