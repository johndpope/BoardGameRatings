			<description>Players pick cards from the draw deck and make decisions based on the information given on each card. Document your decisions on your Game Sheet and move your Player Piece on the Board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the Choices You Will Make: Is it the right time to buy a car? How will I pay for college? Should I start a part time business?  Should I pay for those concert tickets with cash or use my credit card? etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thrive Score measures the decisions you make in the game.&lt;br/&gt;Good decisions = positive Thrive; poor decisions = negative Thrive. Everyone starts out with a zero Thrive Score (Survive).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You WIN if your Player who's game piece reaches Thrive first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
