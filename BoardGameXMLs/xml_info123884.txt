			<description>From the cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something is happening and the realm is changing.  Monsters that haven't been seen in decades have been terrorizing the countryside, ransacking villages and killing the people of the kingdom.  Wizard magic is malfunctioning and the priests of the realm are fearing the end is near.  Everything has taken on a strange sickly-green hue.  Your party has been summoned to help the Lord Mayor discover what has caused the upheaval.  Rumor is that the green hue also emanates from the top of the mysterious spire on the plains, constructed by the greatest wizards of all time and is known as The Tower of the Three Wizards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was originally written for a 4-hour gaming block at the 2012 OwlCon XXXI gaming convention.  It was meant as a one-shot adventure (for character levels 8-12), but can be adapted to fit any campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special thanks to Ed Greenwood for creative input.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
