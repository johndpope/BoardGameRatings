			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, you take control of a mech as you battle other mechs in arena-based combat. The gameplay is third-person, over-the-shoulder action. There are a dozen mechs from which to choose, and each has its strengths. The arenas are littered with power-ups that can enhance your stats for the round you are playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The single-player game offers you five difficulty levels and three gameplay modes: Arcade, features 100 levels that pit you against a variety of enemies; Death Match and Team Death Match, which are both familiar to most gamers. The multi-player offers a bit more variety and can be played co-op or with up to 8 players as adversaries. The 4 modes are: Death Match, Team Death Match, Capture the Flag and Bomb Assault (teams attempt to plant a bomb and blow up the enemy&amp;rsquo;s base).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
