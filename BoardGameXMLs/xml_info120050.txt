			<description>F29 Retaliator is a combat flight simulator video game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was developed during the final phase of the Cold War, based mostly on speculations on then-future machines of war that were expected to be in use in the year 2002, in particular the revolutionary aircraft design of the Lockheed F-22 (based on the game developers' guesstimate, which ended up looking nothing like the real-world Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor) and the Grumman &amp;quot;F-29&amp;quot; (based on the experimental Grumman X-29A).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The graphics were detailed by the standards of the period, featuring cities, bridges, roads, islands, mountains and moving vehicles. The plane's cockpit had three multi-function displays available to set up in a number of configurations. The fantastic &amp;quot;future&amp;quot; weapons to choose from include a fighter-carried Tomahawk cruise missile, rearward-firing AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles and a gigantic cluster bomb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PC version allowed head-to head dogfighting using a null modem cable. This game is regarded as being severely buggy (for example, since the game allows the airplane to be controlled even after the pilot ejects, it is possible for players to hit themselves with their own plane).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes four war scenarios: Arizona desert test and training site, Pacific conflict, Middle East conflict and the World War III in Europe. Each war scenario has several missions, with the total of 99 scenarios between them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A &amp;quot;Special Mission&amp;quot; add-on was released with ZERO magazine in 1990, featuring a battle against the alien spacecraft from the then-upcoming space combat game EPIC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;F29 Retaliator&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only flight simulation to provide 100 complex missions over four intense battle scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only flight simulation to provide detailed daily war update reports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only flight simulation to present the latest in aerodynamic technology introducing ECOP cockpits, backwinder AAMS, supercruise, stealth, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;F-29 is that flight simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;F-29 Retaliator presents the fastest and most detailed graphical environment ever seen in a flight simulation. With multiple internal and external viewpoints, multi-player comms option and a wide range of difficulty levels, F-29 Retaliator will suit both the beginner and the expert pilot. You have the choice of two of the World's most advanced aircraft - the F-22 ATF and F-29.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
