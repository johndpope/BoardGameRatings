			<description>&amp;quot;Super Juegos&amp;quot; was a pioneer Spanish magazine about both, board and computer games, which was published between 1984-1985. Every issue included a board game inside, with rules and cut-out counters. As far as I know only eight numbers were published, at least in its first epoch (another publication with the same name would appear years later, this time focusing on computer games only).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Issue 5 included &amp;quot;Acoso en Nicaragua&amp;quot; which, despite its name (&amp;quot;Pursuit in Nicaragua&amp;quot;), it&amp;acute;s not properly a wargame. The board is a squared one. Each player has a commandant and 36 soldiers (Americans and Sandinistas). Each turn, they move the commandant one square, then places a soldier counter (which can&amp;acute;t never move) trying to immobilize the enemy leader. It&amp;acute;s that simple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
