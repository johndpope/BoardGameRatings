			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I Say a Little Prayer is set in a Nordic capital in the 1980s. The game master decides which city this particular run will be set in. At that time Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm all had similar, rather small gay scenes with just a handful of bars and other venues that were the gay meeting spots in the city. So the feel of the game should be quite similar no matter which city you choose. Ask the players if they are from or know well one of these cities to determine which one it will be the best one to use. Also ask the players which language they would like to play the game in if this hasn&amp;rsquo;t been determined before you gather with the players. In the scenario there are some specified lines that kicks off some of the scenes. Just translate those to a similar line in the language you are playing in if not playing in English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was an English-only game for Fastaval 2014.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
