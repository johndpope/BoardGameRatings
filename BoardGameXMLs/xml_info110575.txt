							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game of Flags of the United Nations</name>
									
			<description>Info on this game gathered from the ELLIOTT AVEDON&lt;br/&gt;VIRTUAL MUSEUM OF GAMES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Card game. There are 40 cards in the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The set of 40 cards shows the flags of the United Nations. They are divided into 12 categories, mostly geographic as follows:&lt;br/&gt; &amp;bull;1 United Nations UN&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;5 Veto Countries VC&lt;br/&gt; &amp;bull;5 South American Countries SAC&lt;br/&gt; &amp;bull;3 Central American Countries CAC&lt;br/&gt; &amp;bull;3 Island Countries&lt;br/&gt; &amp;bull;2 Scandinavian Countries SC&lt;br/&gt; &amp;bull;2 African Countries AC&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;3 Emblem Countries EC&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;4 Moslem Countries MC&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;3 Picture Countries PC&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;3 Costume Countries CC&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;6 Other Countries&lt;br/&gt; The object of the game is to get and meld complete categories (see above list). With two people playing, deal 9 cards to each, three playing, 8 cards, and four playing 7 cards. Place remainder of pack face down in center of table and turn over the top card to start the face up stack. Player at dealer&amp;rsquo;s left starts by drawing a card from either stack, or by calling for a card from some other player. He must have at least one of the cards in the category for which he is calling. If successful he may call again from the same person until unsuccessful and then must discard one card on face up stack, which completes his turn. Then, the next player to left follows the same procedure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complete categories, and meld them, face up, in front of you as fast as possible. A player may pick up all the cards in the face up stack at any turn, but must meld at least one complete category after so doing. You must meld at least two categories before you can meld the single UN card. When any player has no cards left after his discard - the hand ends, and he scores a bonus of 100 for going out. Cards held by other players are discarded for next deal and each scores the total of the value of each card in their meld. Play for time available - highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
