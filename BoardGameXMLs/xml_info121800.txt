			<description>SpongeBob SquarePants: Creature from the Krusty Krab is a video game that stars SpongeBob SquarePants, his best friend Patrick Star and their enemy Sheldon J. Plankton as they journey to nine different worlds, supposedly, inside the dreams of the characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wii version was a North American launch title for Wii. It is also the first SpongeBob game released in Japan (Sony PlayStation 2 and Nintendo Wii versions), but was released under the title: &amp;quot;Spongebob&amp;quot; (スポンジ・ボブ Suponjibobu), to mark it as the first video game in the Spongebob series to have a Japanese release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have access to three playable characters during the game, SpongeBob SquarePants, Patrick Starfishman (Patrick Star in superhero form), and Sheldon J. Plankton, and must guide them through nine levels of play in a dreamworld. Four different types of gameplay have been incorporated into the game, known as flying; rampaging; racing and platforming. During flying sections the game sets obstacles one in front of another, and the player must maneuver past them. In most cases, the game will tell the player which way to fly (up, down, left and right). On the Wii, you use the controller like an actual plane control stick. The most common cases of this is when SpongeBob uses his plane to attack a giant-sized Plankton. In rampage levels the player controls a giant sized Plankton and uses special powers and moves to destroy everything in their path. The player's laser's power is indicated by a bar on the right side of the screen, which refills after use. The Wii version features controller movements that respectively activate moves. Racing gameplay is similar to most racing games; it is featured in both the air and the ground's gameplay, fuel must be collected in order to keep the player's vehicle running. The platforming gameplay is spread throughout the game, such as when Plankton must escape from a live Krabby Patty or when Patrick Starfishman saves Bikini Bottom from his evil form, Dreaded Patrick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;SpongeBob SquarePants: Creature from the Krusty Krab&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
