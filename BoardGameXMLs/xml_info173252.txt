							<name primary="true" sortindex="6">The Commander: A New Character Class</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by similar character classes in other games, this booklet brings the inspirational healing mechanics to your game through the commander: a class dedicated to healing without magic, in the tradition of marshalls and warlords from previous editions, but 100% compatible with the up to date rules of the World's greatest RPG!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tired of clerics, druids and bards? Wish you could keep your allies on their feet without abandonning the gritty warrior archetype you really enjoy to play? If that's your case, we believe the commander is exactly what you need, complete with multiclassing rules and new feats to bring more of the rules presented here to your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
