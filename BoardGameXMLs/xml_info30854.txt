			<description>Super Force Seven (SF7) is a Tactical RPG / Miniatures Adventure Wargame allowing for battles between super powered characters of all kinds. The game can be played as a typical tactical miniatures game, but really shines when the options for added depth are used, allowing it to be played more like a light-RPG or a campaign/story driven tactical miniatures game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is fast paced and simple, and the well thought out design system allows you to easily build your favorite characters from comic books, television, the movies or from your own imagination and lets you pit these characters against each other in a variety of scenarios. These scenarios can range from a simple brawl in the streets to a battle of wits between two masterminds, or anything else you can think of, making this much more than just another game of superhero combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As of November 2008, no further information on this game is available, and the homepage is no longer registered.  This game may be pure vapor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
