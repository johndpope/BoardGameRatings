			<description>The game is called SHADRACK and was distributed &amp;quot;exclusively by the John Ladell Company&amp;quot;. The game was made in TAIWAN and has the number (no.412) on the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a well-made wooden game. It comes with a 10 X 10 board and some hard wood pieces. Those hard wood pieces include 14 tiles with number 1 on them, 10 tiles with number 2, 6 tiles with number 3, and 4 tiles each with N,S,E,and W. The tiles fit into the spots on the game board. Also included is a black covering which lays over the gameboard. That covering has an opening cut in it which allows a 4 x 4 area of the gameboard to become visible. On the covering is printed the name of the game, the company the game is made by, the letters N,S,E,and W and some fancy scrolls in each corner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SHADRACK'S THE NAME. GAMBLING IS THE GAME!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take Tic-Tac-Toe, flavor it with a hint of Craps, toss in a soupcon of Dominoes... and you've got a swinging new game called SHADRACK! Can be played for matches, pennies, dimes or dollars. Two to eight players. Solid mahogany board makes conversation piece worth the price alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
