							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Goblin Garage Sale</name>
									
			<description>Life's tough for goblins.  As if the klastra birds and grignak spiders weren't enough, there's also the constant possibility of having your house blown up by your neighbors (not always on purpose, it's just that most goblins are too curious for their own good).  Mix that with a goblin's natural packrat tendency and what do you get?  A lot of junk left behind in storage (a booming industry for the last 79 years), usually without an owner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Goblin Garage Sale, players are goblin entrepreneurs hoping to get lucky.  Gobo Storing Places Inc. is having a large blind auction of many of its storage garages.  However, players are allowed to see only part of the items in the garage. Using their specific knowledge, players bid their hard-earned monies against the others for the contents.  To the winner: the garage!  Hopefully, it will be filled with glorious junk that the player can add to his personal hoard (for the goblin with the greatest hoard has the greatest bragging rights). If you're lucky, you may even find more monies for future bids!  Just hope that the unfortunate former owner didn't hoard useless things, like soap, and pray that when you open your garage it isn't full of horrors, like kittens (how embarrassing) or even a grignak spider (run!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goblin Garage Sale is a game of bluffing and luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
