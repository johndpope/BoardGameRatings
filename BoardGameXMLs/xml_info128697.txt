			<description>A mathematical card game which first appeared in 1964. The cards feature numbers and you must form pairs. A pair consist of a total on one of the two cards that is equalled when the two cards played are multiplied together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you use all your cards first, the round ends and the player going out scores nothing but the other players take a negative score based on the cards still in their hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To spice up play, there are Problem Cards which are nasty if you get caught with them in your hand when another player goues out. One of them is Mr Whacker, a school teacher who seems to like caning his pupils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
