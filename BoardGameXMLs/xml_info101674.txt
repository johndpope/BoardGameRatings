			<description>Heroes Inc 2 is an expansion to Heroes Inc. This expansion adds several scenarios, two new heroes - named Cat and Mouse, as well as new thugs for them to fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a points system to buy characters with. Players have 40 points to spend on their heroes and villains in order to build the best group. The game follows the core rules of the other Steel and Glory games but adds new rules to accommodate for super hero fighting techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players activate a character which can take up to two actions, including fight, move, rest, climb, or stand/go prone. Characters can attack enemies that are one square away for melee attack or may use ranged attack for enemies further away. Fighting is based on power of the weapon, power of the character's attack strength, and power of the enemies defense strike. The hit points are calculated via 2D6 - the power of the attack. For example, if an attack had a total strength of 6 and a 10 was rolled, the attack would have a power of 4. Victory is achieved by having a character remain on a certain part of the board for three complete uninterrupted turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
