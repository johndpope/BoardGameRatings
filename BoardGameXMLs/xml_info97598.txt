			<description>Them! is a solo horror board game where a player will be on the run from a horrible creature, only hoping to survive until sunrise. With 20 minutes left to survive a player will need to plan an efficient escape route through the forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing a card representing each minute, a player will follow the instructions and draw his or her path along the board. After all his &amp;quot;time&amp;quot; is up, it will be up to him or her to make sure he or she was not caught by the creature. A separate creature deck will contain the activities of the creature, and if lines are crossed, the creature wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game will use a unique color change action requiring the user to change the color of his or her marker, along with that of the creature (at certain intervals). This will be the indicator that the creature was close enough to find the player, or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will consist of:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 24 card player deck&lt;br/&gt;A 24 card creature deck.&lt;br/&gt;A set of template forest terrians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player will provide 5 colored crayons or pencils as well as three tokens to complete the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
