							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Best Treehouse Ever: Kickstarter Promo Pack</name>
									
			<description>This promo pack was part of the stretch goals of the 2015 Best Treehouse Ever Kickstarter campaign for all backers that backed at least a single copy of the game.  It includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Advanced Bonus Cards: 6 more Bonus Cards!  They are also hidden goals but this time the higher you build your secret formations in your tree, the more points they are worth!&lt;br/&gt;     Advanced Game Changers: 4 more score modifier cards will create even more ways to play and some extra strategic decisions for end-of-round scoring!&lt;br/&gt;     Birdhouses: For this variant, each player receives a Birdhouse Card to use once per game.  Discard your Birdhouse to reset your Balance Marker and get yourself out of a tough situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
