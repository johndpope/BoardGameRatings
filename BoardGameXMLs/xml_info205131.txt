			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous experience with role-playing games or other story games is not needed to play Etherium. Role-playing itself was never limited to its game associated meaning and has been used: as a way to indicate forms of acting; as a term for certain training programs in the workplace; as a term for war-game exercises in the military; and as a common tool in counseling and psychology. As for Etherium, the game does not require advanced mathematics. The concepts addressed in the game are as expandable or  disposable as the players wish them to be since these ideas are to serve as a medium for expression for the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For some inscrutable reason, the game was distributed as six separate PDF files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- XEtherium Pages 1 - 4&lt;br/&gt;- Etherium Pages 5 - 15&lt;br/&gt;- Etherium Pages 15 - 18&lt;br/&gt;- XTaboo Sheet&lt;br/&gt;- XEtherium Clock&lt;br/&gt;- Character Sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
