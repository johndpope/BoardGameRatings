			<description>The Reliquary Collection is a boxed set of 12 ancient games from all over the world with origins date between 5000 BCE to 1200 CE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From website: &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Each one features a classic play style that is original and doesn't rely on marketing images to be fun. The collection is varied enough to provide a favorite for everyone and each game is conveniently packaged in a truly unique way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the games in the Reliquary Collection are family friendly, non-violent, and suitable for all ages (there is a choking hazard for very young children).
