							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chaotic Ops</name>
									
			<description>Chaotic Ops is a 1/35th scale skirmish level game based on today&amp;rsquo;s Special Forces and the enemies they face. The first supplement, featuring Law Enforcement and Criminal Organizations, is currently in the composition stage. Players will be able to take control of elite military units, terrorist cells, any number of law enforcement agencies, drug cartels or street gangs. An array of weapons including WMD will be available to either team. Designed for two or more players, game play is fast and full of opportunities. Action can happen anywhere from the desert using tents to a cabin in the woods or a city block. The dossier style game box contains a one hundred-page double coil bound rulebook and two reference cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
