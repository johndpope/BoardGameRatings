			<description>From the intro:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This unusual adventure, written by Dark Conspiracy designer Lester Smith, is part of an upcoming adventure anthology for all horror role-playing games, to be published by Corsair Publishing. Originally, however, it was designed as a two-part convention event for the Dark Conspiracy RPG, to demonstrate the wide range of horror settings possible within that game. Despite that broad expanse of horror themes, however, there is a delightful cohesiveness to it all, a dark secret that lies behind its events. Part of the referee&amp;rsquo;s fun in running the adventure is in watching the players adapt to the unfolding situation, as new layers of truth are revealed as their characters progress through the story. That story also provides plenty of room for you, as referee, to improvise and to personalize events to match your own players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment&lt;br/&gt;this adventure was  posted on Lester's blog&lt;br/&gt;because of that, there are no pages&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
