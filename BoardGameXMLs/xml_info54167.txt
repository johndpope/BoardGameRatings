							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gotham:  Building the American City</name>
									
			<description>Gotham is a tile-laying game set around the turn of the twentieth century.  Players take turns laying tiles to complete city blocks, which they can them claim for points.  More residences on each block means more points.  And civic improvements -- such as churches and schools -- can boost the value of a block.  But watch out:  homes can only be built where commerce supports it.  And urban blights -- like jails and slums -- can reduce a profitable city block into a landlord's nightmare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a free print and play game.  It uses graphics from old insurance maps, and produces a lovely tabletop!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
