			<description>In-app description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atari's final baseball game for the Atari 2600, a follow-up to RealSports Baseball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hit a Homer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the bottom of the ninth, the bases are loaded, and you're up at bat! The visiting team is ahead by three runs. You already have three balls and two strikes, and this next pitch looks like a mean curve. Should you swing on could this be ball four and a free walk to first?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Baseball brings the plays and thrills of real baseball to your video screen! As the batter, you can take extra bases or play it safe. As the pitcher, you can throw curves, screwballs, fast-balls, or change-up pitches. As the outfielder, you can move around the field to catch the ball and make putouts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will have full control over all men on the field. So get out there and &amp;quot;Play Ball!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
