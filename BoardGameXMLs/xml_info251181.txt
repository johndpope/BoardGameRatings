			<description>Mr. Natural is a Press Your Luck dice game for as many players as can sit around a table, played with six six-sided dice, in which the object is being the first player to score 10,000 points. Different single dice or dice combinations are worth from 50 to 1,500 points, depending on the combination. The name of the game comes from the highest-scoring combination, a natural 1 to 6 flush, called &amp;quot;a Mr. Natural&amp;quot; in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in the issue 23 of The Thing Quarterly, an art periodical in form of an object. It consists of six ceramic six-sided dice and a fabric pouch, plus game instructions, contained in a cardboard box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
