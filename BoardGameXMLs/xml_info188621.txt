			<description>Catalog Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Far above the clean, sweeping lines of a futuristic megalopolis, the first wave of craft from another world falls from the skies. Methodically, they work the skyline, releasing the most awesome of weaponry: the terrifying matter ravagers! Instantly, the energy envelope surrounding the city is punctured and several skyrisers sustain serious damage. The first step in the havoc complete, the pulsating vessels disappear into hyperspace as quickly as they had come. But in the span of a few brief seconds, more appear to &lt;br/&gt;recreate anew the terrible destruction....&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt; &amp;quot;This is STRATOS &amp;mdash; a kaleidoscopic explosion of awesome graphics and other-worldly sounds that's light-years beyond any arcade-type game you've ever seen on your micro! This joystick-compatible funfest puts you in TOTAL control of the devastating Armageddon Wave &amp;mdash; the only weapon capable of decimating the attacking alien ships. STRATOS comes loaded with the professional features you've come to expect, including one or two player option, high score save, and mind-melting sounds.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Designed for the home arcader who takes his action white-hot, you can be certain the thrills don't let up with this scorcher! STRATOS &amp;mdash; look to the skies and prepare for the battle that will shred the universe!!!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
