			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This introductory adventure was originally designed for those playing Castles &amp;amp; Crusades. We are now pleased to bring it to you updated and in line with the fifth edition rules set of the world&amp;rsquo;s most well-known role playing game! The module has been designed to allow for the players and Game Master (or Castle Keeper, as we like to say in C&amp;amp;C parlance) alike to begin using the game rules in a fairly non-demanding game setting. The goal is to familiarize the Castle Keeper and players with the basic rules and their applications while undertaking an exciting adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The module is also designed for modularity and expansion. Many of the encounters, monsters, settings and non-player characters&lt;br/&gt;can be removed from the context of this adventure and placed within those of your own making. We here at Troll Lord Games&lt;br/&gt;encourage all gamers to do so as this is the quickest route to ever more fulfilling game-play. As with the core game rules, this module is a tool to use as you will. Please do so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 4-6 characters, levels 1-3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
