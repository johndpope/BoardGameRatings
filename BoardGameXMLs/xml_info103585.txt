							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Using Space Marines</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of those 'Does exactly what it says on the tin' articles. Gav's been thinking a lot about Space Marines lately (perhaps too much), and here's what he has to say.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Marines are the Imperium's most deadly warriors, and are feared by human and alien alike. Accordingly, they are possibly the toughest, strongest and deadliest characters in games of Inquisitor. There has been much debate in the gaming community concerning the battle brothers of the Adeptus Astartes, and I'm here to contribute to that discussion and hopefully provide some answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
