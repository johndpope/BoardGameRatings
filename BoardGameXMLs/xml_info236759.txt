			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have been invited to a lavish dinner with a well known local noble woman, Kendra Ostaram. Ostaram manor is a decadent home with richly appointed furnishings throughout. From the polished marble floors to the exotic and intricately carved wood, to the brightly colored tapestries illustrating the family pedigree, the entire manse is a pageant of aristocratic power and wealth. Olevic Pelegrar greets you at the door and leads you to the dining room. He offers wine and small soft cheeses. He offers to take your cloaks and any weapons, stowing them neatly in a tall bureau in the corner of the room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 1st - 3rd level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
