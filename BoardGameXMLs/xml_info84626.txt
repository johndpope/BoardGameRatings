			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hour of the Gun - Tombstone, Arizona, 1881-2 is a set of three linked miniatures scenarios and a rules set that covers the events surrounding the infamous gunfight at the OK Corral. Scenarios include: Street Fight at the Ok Corral, Tucson Stockyards Ambush, &amp;amp; Shootout at Iron Springs. Characters surviving a scenario (from either the Earp or Clanton faction) are eligible to appear in the next scenario. Off table events (like an assassination attempt on the Earps) between the scenarios help to build suspense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effectively this is a set of skirmish scenarios with characters that are drawn from history. Characters that didn't appear at the events in question, but that might have, are included in charts of &amp;quot;Improbables.&amp;quot; Historical figures that did participate are found in the &amp;quot;Probable&amp;quot; charts, and have a much higher chance of participating. Percentile dice are used to determine the characters in the various scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character has their own set of characteristics which include: Reaction, Control, Bravery, Dexterity, Agility, Physical, Panic Distance, Security Distance, Pistol Skill, Rifle Skill, Hand Weapon Skill, &amp;amp; Fists Skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game requires various old west miniatures and terrain, along with 2d10 for percentile rolls and single d10 rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules set appears in Wargames Illustrated #178 (July 2002)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
