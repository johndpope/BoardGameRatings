			<description>Battle Roller is a tabletop miniatures game focused on Mecha PvP combat. The idea is to capture the feel of games like Armored Core and Titan Fall on the tabletop while still having a system that is easy to get into but with depth for more immersive and challenging game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take on the role of Roller Pilots, customizing and preparing their Rollers for combat.  Each Roller (similar to a mech or power suit) is customizable allowing players to mix and match parts to suit their play style. The deluxe papercraft miniatures as well as the console/dashboard cards are configurable to match the build choices that the player makes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game players allocate EN (energy) to different systems for offence, defense, movement, and initiative and are locked into those actions for the upcoming round.  As they take damage, they lose EN and their systems will go offline until they are no longer able to continue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starter set includes PDFs (letter sized) for the rule book, the Forest Map with obstacles, console cards with EN markers and 2D minis for 4 pre-configured Rollers and Pilots, sticker sheet for Action Dice, and parts and assembly instructions for the deluxe miniatures for the 4 pre-configured Rollers and Pilots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
