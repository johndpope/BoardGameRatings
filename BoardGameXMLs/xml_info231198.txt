			<description>&amp;quot;He who advances vanquishes, but he who awaits the attack of the enemy perishes ingloriously.  To vanquish is our desire.&amp;quot; - Alexi Brusilov&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Trenches: 1916 is not a complete game. You must own either In the Trenches: Doughboys or In the Trenches: Devil Dogs to play 1916.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Trenches: 1916 breathes new life into Tiny Battle Publishing&amp;rsquo;s popular In the Trenches system.  Delve into the gritty tactics of the Battle of the Somme and the Eastern Front&amp;rsquo;s Brusilov Offensive in SIX action-packed scenarios by esteemed designer John Gorkowski, featuring British, Canadian, German, Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and Polish forces.  Lead your men through the great muddy lengths of Regina Trench, across the battle-pocked fields from La Boiselle to the Sausage Valley and through narrow lines dug in at forest&amp;rsquo;s edge at Kostiuchnowka on three beautifully rendered maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by John Gorkowski, In the Trenches enables players to game historically accurate simulations of tactical operations from the Great War. ITT challenges players to move and fight with company-level formations made of separate platoon-sized units during five minute, impulse-based turns. The historically accurate maps are scaled to 100 yards per hex. This approach recreates WWI command and control problems and inspires historically accurate play without forcing decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note:  The six scenarios of In the Trenches: 1916 were originally published in 2009 by Grenier Games, as part of their In the Trenches: The Lost Generation expansion.  We have taken these scenarios, tweaked and polished them, and treated them to brand new artwork by Jose Ramon Faura and a full-color eight-page scenario guide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;         220 Unit Counters (yes, there are two full pages of counters)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;         132 Operational Markers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;         Three 8.5&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot; Maps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;         1 Player Aid Card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;         1 Game Turn Track&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;         1 Full-Color Scenario Book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;         6 Scenarios&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Design: John Gorkowski&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Art: Jose Ramon Faura&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duration: 90-120 minutes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complexity: Medium&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Suitability: High&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
