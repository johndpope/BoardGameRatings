			<description>The lush green grass of irish meadows and a homey shelter provide a pleasurable life for black sheep as well as white ones. A feast for the old lazy wolf. That's why you should keep an eye on your herd with help of the shepherd and his dog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A strategic two player game about tending sheep. Each player moves sheep around the meadows and either into the shelter for twosomeness or off the board to score. A core mechanic is to keep an eye on blancing the size and composition of the flocks. The wolf will kill one of the sheep in the largest flock and you should make sure its not one of yours! You win by scoring enough points or reduce the opponents sheep so they can no longer mate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As all the &amp;quot;Mini-Lederspiele&amp;quot; of Hiku-Spiele this game comes with several semi-precious stones in a leather pouch that when opened is the board of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
