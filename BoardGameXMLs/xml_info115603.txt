			<description>Soccer Game published by Perma Toys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has plastic players that are set into the game board in depressions. Those depressions attract the soccer ball. The players are spring loaded and when the soccer ball falls into their area you can attempt to pass the ball or score a goal by flicking the player pieces. There is a goalie who can block shots on goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
