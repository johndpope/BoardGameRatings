			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Henry DuBois is in a pretty tough spot. His club isn't doing so well and a string of violent murders in the neighborhood hasn't done wonders for business. To give himself a leg up, DuBois just poached one of the best trumpet players in the city from the club on 45th, but the guy went from kind to kind of a jerk seemingly overnight. Karmari has stormed off stage at the drop of a hat and has gone off on other employees.  Without Karmari Harmon, the club is finished. However, he seems to be imploding for no apparent reason.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your job is simple: figure out what is going on with Karmari before the club tanks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Killer Chops&amp;rdquo; is a modern horror adventure for 4&amp;ndash;6 players using Fabled Environments&amp;rsquo; “Jazz Club” and “Warehouse” maps and the Savage Worlds core rules, suitable for an evening&amp;rsquo;s play. An 8 1/2 inch x 11 inch copy of each map is provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
