			<description>Players must exhibit their mastery of the five elements in WuXing by trying to match the master in just the right way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with a hand of cards, with each card showing a hand; each finger of the hand shows one of the five elements on the tip. At the start of a round, someone flips over a card to represent the master's power. Each player then searches her hand for a card that matches the master's card on exactly three fingers &amp;mdash; that is, elements on exactly two fingers have been swapped. If only one player finds such a card, she scores both her card and the master's; if more than one player has such a card, then you need to find an element on another player's card that's on the same finger on your card, with whoever does this first claiming all of the cards played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when someone runs out of cards in hand, then whoever has collected the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
