							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nex</name>
									
			<description>Nex is a variant on the game Hex. Like Hex it is played on a grid of hexagons. One player is trying to connect the top and bottom with stones of their color, while the other player is trying to connect the other two sides with their color. The mechanism that makes it different from Hex is the addition of a neutral color. Each turn a player has a choice between two actions. The first is to simply place a stone of their  color and a neutral stone. The second possibility is to replace two neutral stones with stones of their color and replace a stone of their color with a neutral stone. Neutral pieces are not considered part of any connection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
