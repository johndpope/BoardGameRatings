			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zork Nemesis: The Forbidden Lands is a 1996 graphical adventure game developed by Zombie Studios and published/edited by Activision. It is the eleventh game in the Zork series, and the first such title not to appear under the Infocom label (Return to Zork was marketed with both the Infocom and Activision labels). It was released for the Macintosh , MS-DOS, and Windows 95 platforms (the lattermost using DirectX, another first for Zork). The game's plot was written by Cecilia Barajas, Nick Sagan and Adam Simon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the player takes on the role of a nameless adventurer, charged by Vice Regent Syovar the Strong to enter the Forbidden Lands to investigate the disappearance of four prominent citizens. Additionally, the player is to investigate the rumor of a curse put on the Forbidden Lands by a being known only as &amp;quot;Nemesis,&amp;quot; which has already claimed as a victim the player's predecessor, Agent Karlok Bivotar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon entering the Forbidden Lands, the player finds a message left by the spirit of Alexandria Wolfe. The player enters the Temple of Agrippa to find the four citizens mentioned above (known as &amp;quot;The Alchemists&amp;quot;), held in coffins. As the player purifies their respective elements within the temple, they are able to speak of what they have done, giving insight into what has happened here. The &amp;quot;Nemesis&amp;quot; has &amp;quot;killed&amp;quot; them, holding them in a state of eternal torture. The player also learns the ill-fated story of two of their children - Kaine's son Lucien and Malveaux's daughter Alexandria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Charged with learning the truth, the player travels to each of these characters' private dwellings to find the four lost elements and bring the world back into balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
