							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Defenders of Knife Edge Pass</name>
									
			<description>A horde of terrible creatures are on the rampage in the East. The defenceless trading village of Hilt (located just to the west of Knife Edge pass) has called for heroes to help defend Hilt and the entire western lands from the oncoming horde. Choose between 1 and 3 heroes to defend the pass, defeat the oncoming horde and claim VICTORY! ... plus Hilt is super rich and has many beautiful, eligible, young men and women!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Construct the Pass using between 3 and 5 double sided cards, construct the Horde deck based upon a chosen scenario and choose between 1 and 3 heroes.  Each turn a new monster enters the pass.  You will need to upgrade your heroes and use all your skills in order to stop the advancing horde.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beware! If a single monster makes it through the pass or all your heroes die then you lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
