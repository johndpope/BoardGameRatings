			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A budget run n'gun game. The manual says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;THE STORY (OR EXCUSE)&lt;br/&gt;STAR-TROOPER, MARINE CORP., HIGH COMMAND (SLOUGH BRANCH ) EXTRACT TAKEN FROM MISSION DEBRIEFING: A56/7W&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mission 'Denizen' was only a partial success. Jabba McGut, leader of the evil Alien Syndicate, has escaped us once again. Our special 'Star-Trooper' operations task force tracked him to his secret HQ complex. Unfortunately before they had a chance to attack, Jabba learnt of their plans. Before leaving the planet, Jabba made his mutant mercenaries throw any useful equipment into the bases incinerators. We believe that Earths only supplies of 5 new super alloys (stolen in a recent raid ) were also thrown into the furnace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE MISSION&lt;br/&gt;You have been selected for this very dangerous mission. The alloys must be found and returned to our Slough HQ. You must go down to the planets surface and search for the ingots. When you have found all five, return to your shuttle for further instructions. This mission will not be easy, the bases automated defence system has been put into operation and you will have to contend with Jabbas robots. To make things worse you will need to collect lift passes, teleport access cards and forcefield protection shields, which have been thrown into the incinerators.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game programmed by Robert Lever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
