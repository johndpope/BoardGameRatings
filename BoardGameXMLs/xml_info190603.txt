			<description>Put down your weapons! You fought your battles, now hire heroes for the hard work. Players bid to complete quests and earn rewards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player begins with gold that they use to secretly bid for Heroes to complete their quests. The player with the highest bid wins the Hero's service. Their quest and hero is set aside until the required number of days (turns) pass. The Hero then returns with gold. Journey tokens add twists that may help or hurt players. Play continues around the table with new quests and new heroes. After 10 turns any heroes still out questing come home and all players count their gold to see who is richest!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
