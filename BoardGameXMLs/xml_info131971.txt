			<description>from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breach is for 2 players and is played with Go stones on an initially-empty square grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you take the lead (i.e. when you build a row longer than any built up to that point in the game), your opponent can (optionally) replace one of your stones with her own, in lieu of placing one of her stones on her next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. White begins by placing 1 stone on any empty space.&lt;br/&gt; 2. Then, starting with Black, the players take turns. On your turn you must place 2 stones on any 2 empty spaces. &lt;br/&gt; 3. If you complete a row with a score of at least 2, and that score is higher than any previous score by either player, you must move your scoring marker to that score on the scoring track. &lt;br/&gt; 4. After you move your scoring marker, your opponent gets an additional option on her next turn (and only on that turn): instead of placing 2 stones, she may choose to place 1 stone and then replace any one of your stones on the board with one of her own. &lt;br/&gt; 5. If the longest row is broken up due to a stone replacement, the scoring marker is not moved back - scoring markers never move backwards.&lt;br/&gt; 6. The game ends when the board is full and the player with the highest score on the scoring track at that time wins (in practice the winner will be obvious well before the board is full, and the trailing player should resign at that point).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
