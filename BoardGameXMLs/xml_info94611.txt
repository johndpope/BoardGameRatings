			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the allure of the cyborg? Perhaps it is the viability of the technology. The age of the artificial heart is already upon us. Can a super-powered artificial limb be far behind? Perhaps it is the question raised about the very nature of humanity. Films such as Blade Runner and Aliens have explored this question eloquently, even as they entertain. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s just the &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; factor, the &amp;ldquo;Wow&amp;rdquo; factor, the &amp;ldquo;Cool&amp;rdquo; factor, or whatever other name you want to give it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A &amp;ldquo;hardwired&amp;rdquo; cyborg can be accomplished with the standard M&amp;amp;M rules easily enough. Slap the Super-Science origin on the Telescopic Sense power, and you&amp;rsquo;ve got a perfectly good targeting lens implant. However, it stands to reason that, if my Black &amp;amp; Decker power drill can accept 27 different attachments, my cyborg should have a little versatility as well. That&amp;rsquo;s the concept behind modular cybernetics. It&amp;rsquo;s the science that permits various cybernetic implants to be changed in and out as needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the point? Imagine a top-secret governmental assault team comprised of the most advanced cyborgs on the planet. Need them to infiltrate the Russian mafia&amp;rsquo;s headquarters in Siberia? No problem. Swap in implants that let them speak Russian and ward off the cold. Need them to recover an errant nuclear warhead, sitting on the ocean floor? Piece of cake. Outfit them with implants that let them swim at great speed and ignore the immense pressure of deep water. Daughter of a U.S. Ambassador kidnapped by a drug kingpin and held captive in the Andes? Well, you get the idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sound too good to be true? No one superhero team can do all that? Guess again. Ladies and gentlemen, meet the T.O.M.C.A.T.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
