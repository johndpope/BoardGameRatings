			<description>There are 3 game variations, all on the same game board. Two players Play with 12 playing pieces each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A. Einkreisungsspiel Maja&lt;br/&gt;One playing Piece of each player is called the &amp;quot;Maja&amp;quot;. Which one is hidden from the Opponent (marked on the bottom). The players try to encircle the enemy pieces. Encircled pieces are taken out of the game. If the black Maja is encircled on a yellow space it may reenter the game, but if it ist encircled on a blue space the opponent has won the game. The opposite is true for the white Maja.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B. R&amp;ouml;sselpunktspiel&lt;br/&gt;The pieces start at one edge of the game board and have to reach the opposite edge. The pieces move like a chess knight. The first player to get all 12 pieces to the opposite side of the game board wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C. T&amp;uuml;rmerspiel&lt;br/&gt;The pieces start at one edge of the game board and have to reach the opposite edge to turn into towers. The pieces move any number of spaces in all directions. Opposite pieces can be taken by skipping over the piece sideways to a free space directly behind it.&lt;br/&gt;Pieces that reach the opposite edge of the game board, get turned into a tower by stacking a second piece on top of it. Towers may take enemy pieces (or Towers) by skipping over them not only to the space directly behind the taken piece but to several spaces behind, if there are no other pieces or towers in-between. The last player to have any playing pieces on the board wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
