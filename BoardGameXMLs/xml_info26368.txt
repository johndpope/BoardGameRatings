							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Goth or Gauche?</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website, 2003, via the Wayback machine:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In Goth or Gauche? you take on the role of a peripathetic freak and traipse around the club, quothing, posing, and angst-dancing the night away.  Bottle Dancer on the floor?  You'll shudder in horror and avoid her like the plague until you can Make Them Leave.  Is Phoenix showing off his prodigious jewelry again?  Just wait 'til he gets Entangled and laugh your head off.  Now, not every night is going to be Goth.  Sometimes Fire &amp;amp; Brimstone, the Graver, the Lech, and the Manic Goth may show up together - and you may not be able to Make Them Leave fast enough.  That doesn't mean it's a bad night, though.  NO!  Enjoy your Gaucheness and laugh along with the uncool.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Limited print run, released Dragon*Con 2002. Box unfolded to become the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
