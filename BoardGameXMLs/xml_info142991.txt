			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; IN DEVELOPMENT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it, nor add new releases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Mario &amp;amp; Sonic at the Sochi Winter Games (tentative title) is an upcoming sports video game in development by Sega for the Wii U. It is the fourth game in the Mario &amp;amp; Sonic series and is the official video game for the 2014 Winter Olympics being held in Sochi. A release date has yet to be announced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Like previous games in the series, the game sees players choose characters from the Mario and Sonic franchises and participate in a series of Olympic events. Events are controlled either using the Wii Remote MotionPlus and Nunchuk controllers, or the Wii U GamePad, with some events, such as the biathlon, utilising both control methods. Along with returning events, such as skiing, bobsledding and curling, new events include figure skating pairs and snowboarding slope style. Like the previous games, players can also participate in fictional Dream Events, including a new mixed event in which causes can be simultaneously played with snowboarding, skiing and bobsledding players. These events are played in places from the Mario and Sonic franchises.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mario &amp;amp; Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
