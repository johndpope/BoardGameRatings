			<description>from the introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few things can cause a full-blown panic faster than yelling &amp;ldquo;SHARK&amp;rdquo; on a crowded beach. And few things will strike fear into the heart of your otherwise fearless warrior faster than noticing the first fin break the water as he struggles to stay afloat in his plate mail (hey, you told him not to wear it on the ship!). While mankind has pretty much dominated the land,&lt;br/&gt;it has yet to master the sea. For many, the shark is the ultimate reminder that when humans enter the water they are no longer the apex predator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product clarifies and adjusts some of the information from the SRD to better replicate the true nature of sharks. The Challenge Ratings have been adjusted up due to these changes. This product also provides detailed information on specific species of sharks, with modifiers that should be added to the base shark statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
