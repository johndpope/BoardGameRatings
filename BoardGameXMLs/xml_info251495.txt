							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cyclops Trans-Littoral Combat Walker</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat Walkers are the precursors to modern battledress, and for a while, exist alongside the smaller suits as heavy fire support. This micro-supplement for Traveller, written by the author of 2300AD and Traveller Supplement 5-6: Vehicle Handbook, examines a special-purpose combat walker called the Cyclops. The Cyclops is designed for littoral (shallow-water) environments, and serves as heavy fire support for troops along the shore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes stat and details on the Cyclops, along with two variants, the Cyclops Mk2, and the Polyphemus. Additional information is provided on new vehicular weapons, new skills, and a new robot, the Attack Remote-Operated Vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three adventure seeds complete the book, each with detailed world map and adventure notes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
