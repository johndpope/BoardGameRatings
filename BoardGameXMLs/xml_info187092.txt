			<description>Quizzers is a novel set of questions that is a combination of the classic of a board game and more modern Apps. Up to 4 players of different ages can play this game with questions adapted to your level of knowledge. The App has been designed to recognise each player's turn and pose questions adapted to their age or school year. Both cultural and general questions that might appear on school tests, making Quizzers an extraordinary game for playing with the whole family on equal terms while also being a great tool as a way of reinforcing subjects studied at school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
