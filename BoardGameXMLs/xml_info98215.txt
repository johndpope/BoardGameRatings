			<description>Game Manual [with bracketed user comments]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get set and go with these two 1-player problem solving quizzes to sharpen your Multiplication and Division skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiplication&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After pressing START, the first problem will appear on the screen with two question marks under the answer line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Instructions explain how to enter your answer using the hand controller.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your answer is wrong, &amp;quot;TRY AGAIN&amp;quot; will appear on the screen. You have one more chance to solve the problem correctly and score a point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If, after the second attempt to solve the problem, the answer is still incorrect, Math Quiz will turn itself into a blackboard and show you how to get the solution to the problem step by step. A point will be added to the score in the lower right corner. This is the number of incorrect problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Division&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Instructions are the same as for multiplication.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Puzzles and Activities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following puzzles and activities will help you sharpen your arithmetic skills. Play the game with friends and try making up some games of your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hang Math&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play Hang Math the same way you would play hangman. Draw a simple gallows. For each wrong answer, draw a part of the body. &amp;quot;TRY AGAIN&amp;quot; counts as a wrong answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The person who completes a body first loses and is out of the game. Note: For longer games, eyes, nose, mouth, fingers and toes can be added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Several other multi-player games are described in the manual. These involve rules that must be enforced by the players, and typically require pencil and paper. These games include Mathematical Chairs, Up To 1000, Star Gazer, A-maze-ing Math, Digital Dots, and Math Battle.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
