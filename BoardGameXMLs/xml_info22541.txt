							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Football Fever</name>
									
			<description>Football Fever is as the title implies a football (soccer) game in which 2-6 players compete for the championship by means of football knowledge and playing matches against each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays much like Monopoly in that, players will roll 2 dice and move around a circular playing field. However there are no properties to buy, instead players will have to answer football related questions, play matches, play set pieces (ie. penalty kick, free kick etc.) or gain bonuses in the shape of cards that'll give them an advantage in the aforementioned matches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Football matches are played out on the middle of the board, and uses a colored die to determine the movement of the ball and subsequently the success of attempts on goal. matches are timed with a tiny hourglass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player to first reach 15 points on the scoreboard by answering trivia questions AND reach 3 match victories is declared winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
