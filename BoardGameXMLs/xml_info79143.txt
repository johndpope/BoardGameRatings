			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the commander of the starship PARSEC patrolling an alien planet. Suddenly, the onboard computer announces that you are about to come under attack by small alien fighters and large, heavily armed, hostile alien cruisers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fighters are highly mobile, and unless they are eliminated by your laser, they fill the screen, restrict maneuvering of your craft, and may cause a deadly collision. The cruisers are highly aggressive and their armament devastating. Armed with photon missiles, they track your ship and fire on it. You must outmaneuver and destroy them with accurate fire from your ship's laser. If you survive the waves of alien craft, do not let down your guard, for you also have to blast through an asteroid belt or refuel your ship, demanding the utmost in skillful flying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
