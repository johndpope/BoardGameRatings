			<description>&amp;quot;KOKUGA is a top-down, 360-degree free-scrolling shooter. Players select one of twelve stages, destroying drones, enemy tanks, gun towers, and other mecha as they progress. Each stage culminates with a boss fight, pitting the players' compact tank against larger, heavily armed bosses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KOKUGA FEATURES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     One and done - In KOKUGA, gamers are challenged to focus on honing their marksmanship skills as the player is limited to one shot on the screen while using their main weapon. With gun towers fixing their sights on the player's craft and platoons of enemy tanks and drones closing in, each round can determine if KOKUGA will complete its mission or if it will be engulfed in enemy fire.&lt;br/&gt;     Attack and support cards - In each stage, the player has access to a fixed set of 20 attack and support cards. Distributed at random, use the cards strategically to maximize your score, blast through tough enemy platoons, or assist another player in your squad.&lt;br/&gt;     Personalize your play time and degree of difficulty - Whether you want a quick run or a long challenger, players can easily tailor their game time in KOKUGA. For some fast action, clear a stage next to one of the finals and proceed directly to one of the main bosses. Or if you want to dig in for a lengthy session, work your way through several stages before facing off with a boss. Choose from 4 different difficulty levels as well.&lt;br/&gt;     Multiplayer modes - KOKUGA supports Local and Download Play, so assemble a squad of up to four players for some co-op gaming. Develop new strategies with a bigger squad and help out your teammates by coordinating card use.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
