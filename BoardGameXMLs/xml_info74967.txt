			<description>From the rear cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever wondered what kind of alien species would live on the worlds of your own Traveller campaign? Referees, are you tired of variations on the same old theme, of &amp;quot;people in rubber suits&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;humans with rubber foreheads&amp;quot;, when creating aliens for your new campaign setting? Are you looking for a way to play the aliens that are mentioned only in passing in your favorite Traveller rule books? If so, look no further!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flynn's Guide to Alien Creation offers Traveller Referees a complete system for alien species creation, starting with only a Universal World Profile and two six-sided dice. With examples taken from the forthcoming Azri Drakara Campaign Setting, Referees are guided through the process of generating their own interesting and varied alien species for their Traveller campaign settings. There's even advice on how to further define your alien culture, adding a rich and rewarding depth to the new alien species you have created using Flynn's Guide to Alien Creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product supplements the 2D6 open-gaming system presented in the Traveller System Reference Document, and requires the use of the Traveller main rules book, which is available from Mongoose Publishing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
