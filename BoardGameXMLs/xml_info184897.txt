							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood of the Magi</name>
									
			<description>On a distant planet, a lonely God peers over his barren domain. &amp;quot;If only there was an Other.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;In that instant, a new race was born, perfect in mind body, and spirit. This new race, the Magi, had awesome powers and could control the elements of Earth, Fire, and Water. &lt;br/&gt;They even manipulated the weather and the fabric of Space-Time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preferring the company of each other, the God sent a curse to the planet and attempted to destroy his &amp;quot;failed&amp;quot; experiment. A bloody battle breaks out between groups of these Magi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take control of an army of powerful Magi and arrange a battlefield to take advantage of elemental and tier advantages during the bloody battles where strategy, luck, chaotic effects, spells and d6 rolls decide who comes out on top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A rich variety of spells with effects that range from buffing a Magi to damaging your foe's Magi, stealing their spells, even rearranging their battlefield. A few are powerful enough to resurrect a dead Magi!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beware! When you have defeated your enemies to be the last one standing, the angry God will descend to the planet to battle you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prevent his attempt to eradicate your existence!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
