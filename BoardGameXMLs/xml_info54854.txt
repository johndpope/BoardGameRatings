			<description>In this humorous game set in the world of Lewis Carroll's &amp;quot;Alice's Adventures in Wonderland&amp;quot; and its sequel &amp;quot;Through the Looking-Glass&amp;quot;, players attempt to collect the characters from the stories by following the command of the Queen of Hearts: &amp;quot;Off With Their Heads!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a line-up of characters from the stories, players attempt to collect the lead person in line. Bonus points are awarded for collecting certain sets of characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use action cards to manipulate the line to get the characters they want most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is an homage to / re-implementation of Guillotine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
