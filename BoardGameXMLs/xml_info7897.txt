			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1895 in Russia, a group of Christian villagers, believing deeply in Peace and Sharing, burned the Weapons given them by the Tsar. We become those villagers driving wagons through the countryside, visiting homes to collect Firewood &amp;amp; Weapons. We take these to the Village Center and make Ploughshares. Watch for the Tsar's patrolling soldiers who will confiscate our wagons and send us to prison. Learn love and courage so, with the guidance of our Wise Elders, we will remain determined in our Cause. We might even inspire some Soldiers to drop their weapons and join with us. It will be an Adventure filled with danger and great rewards. To fulfill our task, we must be gentle as a Dove and wise as a Serpent. This is a game of collaboration, learning and discussion; a game full of exciting strategy, with each of us making an important contribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Esperanto version of Ploughshares was published by Esperanto Antaŭen in 2004 under the title &amp;quot;Sokoj&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
