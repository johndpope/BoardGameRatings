							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ten Sports Games To Play With Dice</name>
									
			<description>From the &amp;quot;Letter from the author&amp;quot; page:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The games included in this 'Ten Sports Games To Play With Dice' have been developed and played by my family and friends for over 20 years.  Foregoing the more traditional board games which sell for five and ten dollars and more, we would take our pencil and paper and a pair of dice and develop a game of our own.  This way, we could make the game suit whatever mood we were in.  Being avid sports fans like yourself, we often developed different sports games that we could use to capture the excitement of real sports.  So over the years we gradually accumulated the rules for dice games in nearly every popular sport.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes the following games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Dice Baseball&lt;br/&gt;     Dice Football&lt;br/&gt;     Dice Basketball by Players&lt;br/&gt;     Dice Hockey&lt;br/&gt;     Dice Basketball - Scholastic Quarters&lt;br/&gt;     Dice Soccer&lt;br/&gt;     Dice Baseball - Team Play&lt;br/&gt;     Dice Basketball - Professional&lt;br/&gt;     Dice Bowling&lt;br/&gt;     Dice Wrestling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
