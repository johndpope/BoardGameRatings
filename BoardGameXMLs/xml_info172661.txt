			<description>Welcome to Gauntlet of Heroes. Are you ready to take up the gauntlet against other Heroes and face the many challenges that await your party?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your heroes delve into a long forgotten crypt, rumored to be filled with treasure and danger! Equip your team of brave Heroes as they defeat monsters and maneuver past obstacles to find the treasure and gold that is hidden there. Your Heroes will also face opposition from other parties searching the dungeon. Your Heroes will journey until they find and defeat the elite monster in the final room. The party of Heroes with the most gold wins. So gear up and get out there and show your opponents who the REAL Hero is!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the Gauntlet of Heroes is to be the player with the most Gold Pieces when the game ends. The player gains Gold Pieces by completing Challenges (defeating monsters, overcoming obstacles, and collecting treasures).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
