							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">New Glory Naval Base</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Often there's no more than meets the eye.  Occasionally there is . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an era of demilitarization and downscaling, New Glory Naval Base has been lucky to survive.  Now life returns to it, brushing away years of inactivity and abandonment.  New facilities fill buildings long empty.  The hillside tunnels remain officially closed, yet military freight carriers arrive daily.  The hum of armored vehicles echoes through the woods, gunfire pierces the night, and old sailors warn that the ghosts of New Glory have never been known to be quiet.  It is a new age for the relic of the past, and something stirs deep within it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Glory Naval Base is an extensive, highly detailed military and scientific installation with unusual twists and turns, long and colorful history, and a healthy dose of the unexpected - and sometimes the unexplainable.  New Glory provides an intricate background that maximizes reusability for adventures in multiple campaign themes while simultaneously serving as a recurring focal point of interest.  This completely self-contained modular accessory is an intriguing and invaluable addition to contemporary roleplaying games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
