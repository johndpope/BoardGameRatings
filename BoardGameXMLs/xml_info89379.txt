			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;An intriguing educational game from Europe, this game had you flying around in a spaceship along a gridded landscape dodging flying obstacles and wrapping your ship's talons around energy balls which, when touched, would display educational questions.  Once you'd encountered enough of them, you'd fly off into space and be asked those questions again.  If you got them right, you could go to the next level.  The questions configuration file was customizable, so you could make new learning levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
