			<description>A playbook for tremulus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have always felt apart, different, as though you didn&amp;rsquo;t belong anywhere. You attended university, got a nice job, and found a place where you could live out a mundane, ordinary existence. Somewhere deep within, you knew it couldn&amp;rsquo;t last. It began with the letters from a place you never heard of, a place you felt called to you, and you let them languish, unopened, and unread. Afraid of what they might contain. You had been warned to always avoid that side of the family. Then the man came, an attorney with a briefcase, a ticket, and a deed to your ancestral home. You felt a sudden release, as though you&amp;rsquo;d been holding your breath all these years, and decided to see for yourself if there was really a future for you somewhere else in a place less ordinary, a place where you might belong, a place you could call your home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
