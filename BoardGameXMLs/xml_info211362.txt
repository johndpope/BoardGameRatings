							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Archclericy of Veluna Gazetteer</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome traveler to the Archclericy of Veluna. The heart and soul of Oerth. Inside these pages you will find a wealth of knowledge and information on this great land. From the shining lances and helms of the Knights of Veluna to the hallowed halls of the Great College of Veluna, from the beautiful tree-city of the elves of Asnath to the sprawling markets of Devarnish, Veluna has something that will catch the eye of one and all. The Archclericy is a shining example of what goodness and co-operation can achieve even in these dark times we live in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This item provides background and setting development for the Archclericy of Veluna on Greyhawk.  It was created by the Veluna Triad and Veluna Council (the formal organizations charged with, respectively, creating and running the Living Greyhawk Veluna Regional play program) - but it was not published by Wizards of the Coast.  It was intended to function as a free resource to introduce and orient players to the Veluna region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
