			<description>Players are CEOs of 5 companies that lay tracks to different cities.&lt;br/&gt;The CEOs wish to make their investments grow but the Board Of Directors of each company oversee the development of their companies. They will intervene if the CEOs do not expand as much as they'd like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will ship oil and coal and bring back steel to the company's warehouse. &lt;br/&gt;Market will dictate the value of the merchandise and make the company's value rise.&lt;br/&gt;Laying track and connecting cities will also make the company's value rise but will also give a bonus to the CEOs.&lt;br/&gt;But beware of merchandise placement: delivery can be taken over by another company!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each stock in a company gives the right to the CEO of doing one order; if he has 2 or even 3 stock, he does 3 orders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
