			<description>A space race card game for two or more players. Each player controls a space ship. The first ship to travel 100 Astronomical Units wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a deck of sixty-five cards. There are four types of cards in the deck: Propulsion, Difficulty, Breakdown, and Repairs. Players advance by playing Propulsion Cards. Difficulty Cards can be played to negate specific Propulsion Cards. Breakdown Cards can be played on opposing players. A Breakdown Card stays in effect until it is repaired with the appropriate Repair Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
