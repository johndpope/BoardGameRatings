			<description>Rare board game set around buying and selling stocks and shares determined by advantage and dis-advantage squares on the playing board, the game is for 3 to 7 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes the part of a broker and is dealt stock cards and money to start the game. Play moves around the board on the throw of the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you sell shares or buy shares? You could go for oil, gold, rubber etc.. Wheel and deal is the order of the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a broker is unable to pay a debt in full,  he is said to be hammered - Therefore out of the game. The objective is to be the last remaining broker left standing when all the others have been hammered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Brokers in the game Are called:&lt;br/&gt;Knight and Day&lt;br/&gt;Spenlow and Jorkins&lt;br/&gt;Dunn and Haddit&lt;br/&gt;Dimple and Curve&lt;br/&gt;Catchem and Bending&lt;br/&gt;Hookem and Havem&lt;br/&gt;Dodgson and Fogg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
