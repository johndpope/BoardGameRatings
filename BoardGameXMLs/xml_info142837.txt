			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this Hangman style game you must figure out a secret saying or phrase. Correctly specifying the phrase earns a player up to 50 points. The actual point award for a particular phrase decreases with each incorrect guess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a two player game the players do not work on the same phrase - they take turns working on different phrases. Because of this there is an option to use custom phrases secretly entered by the opposing player rather than the pre-programmed phrases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A series of underscore marks are displayed to represent each letter in the phrase. The player enters a letter of the alphabet. If the letter appears in the phrase, it is inserted at the appropriate point(s). If the letter does not appear in the phrase, the player loses 2 points from the possible score. There is one important exception: vowels are not allowed to be guessed. If a player presses a vowel, an additional 10 points are deducted from the possible score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player believes he knows the phrase, he can enter his proposed answer. If the answer is correct, the player is awarded the adjusted point value of the phrase. No points are awarded for an incorrect answer. Instead the phrase is revealed and the player's turn ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after each player has attempted to identify four phrases. The winner is the player with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
