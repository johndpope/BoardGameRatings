			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feel More. Do Less.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sixth World is full of seductions, and perhaps no siren song is sweeter than that of simsense. Feel the rush of new love without the work of having to date another person. Skydive from the upper reaches of the atmosphere without leaving your couch. Experience every emotion humans are capable of feeling, and do it with a greater intensity than most humans will ever feel. Just don&amp;rsquo;t spend too much time wondering what it&amp;rsquo;s doing to your brain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alleys and backrooms of every major sprawl in the world are littered with better-than-life junkies who can do nothing but think about their next fix. Reality is nothing more a pale shadow of the vitality and energy they experience with the right chips and downloads. Their need is deep&amp;mdash;which, in the hallowed tradition of the Sixth World, means they are ripe for exploitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sim Dreams and Nightmares contains information about the full range of simsense offerings, as well as new qualities and addiction rules to fully reflect the toll that simsense and better-than-life offerings can take on users. Runners can learn how to deal with the addicts out there&amp;mdash;and explore how deep into the seamier side of the Sixth World they want to get.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sim Dreams and Nightmares is for use with Shadowrun, Twentieth Anniversary Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
