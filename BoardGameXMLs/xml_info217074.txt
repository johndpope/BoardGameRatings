			<description>Lode Runner Online: The Mad Monks' Revenge is an enhanced version of the 1994 computer game Lode Runner: The Legend Returns. As the title suggests, the game features online functionality so that players can battle or work together from remote locations in network games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While maintaining all of the original features of The Legend Returns, Lode Runner Online adds several new features as well, such as bombs which constantly self-ignite and reappear on a set timer. New available &amp;quot;worlds,&amp;quot; which determine background and terrain appearance on a map, are a chief addition. New hazards, such as phase blocks, which disappear and reappear on a set timer (and consequently can tear apart players or monks standing in the location of a vanished block in the process of reappearing), and items are among other additional features; notably, editors can specify certain items to be able to be picked up by only the player of corresponding color (e.g. bombs with blue outlines can only be picked up by the second player, Wes Reckless, not Jake Peril).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The level editor is also more complex than in the original game. Including all of these innovations, an editor may place multiple exits throughout a level, and the exits can be programmed to lead to differing levels in a pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lode_Runner_Online%3A_The_Mad_Monks%27_Revenge Lode Runner Online: The Mad Monks' Revenge]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
