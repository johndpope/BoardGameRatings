							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Battle of Frozen Waste</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published as a series of forum posts to a competition website.  Posts were made over several days (interspersed with numerous unrelated posts), which makes locating all of the game slightly difficult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game are all heroes, and they are referred to as &amp;quot;paladins&amp;quot; though such is not a class.  Instead, characters belong to an archetype, which is vaguely like a class.  Play proceeds with the use of a bag of colored stones that are drawn during action resolution.  Characters establish the meaning(s) of the various colors, and this may vary from character to character.  Play proceeds in phased turns; the game master is called the &amp;quot;Ambassador&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
