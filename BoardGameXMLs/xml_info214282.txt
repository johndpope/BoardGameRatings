In Pictionary Pairs, each team draws one part of a paired clue (Bride &amp;amp; Groom, Cops &amp;amp; Robbers). Winning team guesses the entire phrase! First team to win three of each type of card (All Play and Pictionary Pairs) wins the game. Comes with two Pictionary men, two shapes (box, ball), four paddles to draw on, 150 clue cards, timer, markers, and more. Ages 8 and older. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be an artist&amp;mdash;Pictionary is a blast for everyone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
