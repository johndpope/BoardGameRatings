							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Uranium Fever: Asteroid Mining Rules for the Cepheus Engine</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mining is a time-honored practice, its roots going back to the Stone Age. When humanity reached space, it began mining the asteroid bodies and extraterrestrial planets in pursuit of metal and ice. The most desired and profitable of these minerals are rare earths and radioactives. With asteroid mining, the Belter was born &amp;ndash; a profession, and then a culture, of space miners. The company miner, working for corporation or government, works long shifts on interplanetary rocks for a steady salary and employment benefits. The independent belter, on the other hand, strikes out into the belt, prospecting, and mining with his own ship. Usually, he scrapes by on base metals and the more abundant rare earths. However, what sustains the belter through hard work and the loneliness of space is the lust for hitting a &amp;quot;motherlode&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; good radioactive ore worth a fortune. As the 20th century song goes, this Uranium Fever infects the miner's heart and propels them into the unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product explores the theme of interstellar mining. Its default setting is These Stars Are Ours! &amp;ndash; Stellagama Publishing's space-opera setting. However, almost all material in this book will work perfectly well in any science fiction setting using the Cepheus Engine rules or any similar 2d6 OGL ruleset. The book begins with a discussion of belt mining in Terran space in the 23rd century, and then provides detailed rules for generating belter characters, generating asteroid belt characteristics in the Cepheus Engine, and mining asteroid belts. It also includes three belter spacecraft, and a collection of equipment serving in the interstellar mining industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, fire up your fission reactor, calibrate your mining laser, and follow the calling of Uranium Fever to distant stars!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
