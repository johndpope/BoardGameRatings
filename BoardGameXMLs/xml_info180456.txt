			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This month, Unearthed Arcana goes big with a look at the first draft of psionics rules for fifth edition D&amp;amp;D. This article provides a quick overview of how psionics works and presents a new class &amp;mdash; the mystic. Similar to how the cleric represents a wide variety of divine magic users, the mystic encapsulates a variety of characters who wield psionic power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the options presented in this article, you can play a mystic to 5th level, following one of two psionic orders and training in that order&amp;rsquo;s unique disciplines. Following the Order of the Awakened allows you to create a mystic who manipulates the minds and awareness of other creatures, and who can tap into unseen psionic power both in and out of combat. Following the Order of the Immortal allows you to create a mystic who focuses psionic power in combat, similar to the battlemind or psychic warrior of previous editions. Other options for the mystic will appear as the playtest progresses and we gain valuable feedback about the class's mechanics in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As usual, you can expect a survey asking for feedback on these draft rules in about a month or so. At this point, we&amp;rsquo;re not necessarily tied to any of these options. This effort is merely a first draft to gauge where we should start and what kind of approach to psionics in fifth edition will work best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
