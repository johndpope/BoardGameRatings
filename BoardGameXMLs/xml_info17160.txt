			<description>Sound Effects&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CD guessing game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the sound of one hand clapping? That's one sound you won't be asked to identify while playing Sound Effects, a fun new game that has the whole family listening! You will, however, be required to identify 80 other sounds, including the sound of someone brushing their teeth, a skill saw, a pinball machine, a tree falling or a mosquito...after listening for only a few seconds. Fun for anyone aged 4 to 104, Sound Effects can be played at any level. Players determine beforehand the level of difficulty (the tracks get progressively hard to identify) and how long they'll get to hear the sound before they must write their answer down. Mix it up by hitting random play on your CD player or take it with you in the car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes a CD of more than 80 sound effects, pencils and score pads.&lt;br/&gt;Ages 4 and up, 2+ players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
