			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ballaton sits on the southern border of the Neverwinter Wood, just north of the Triboar Trail. It is a major supplier of alchemist reagents as well as food stocks for Neverwinter and Triboar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town is under the rule of a noble family from Neverwinter and lesser family member is often found in the village to collect taxes, adjudicate disputes and control the everyday administrative affairs. The ruling noble family in Ballaton is the Stonegrip family, they have a long history with both the village and Neverwinter as a firm traditionalist family honouring order and law. Ballaton had recently been under the influence of a vampire but due to the wits of the Stonegrip&amp;rsquo;s the threat was dealt with internally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
