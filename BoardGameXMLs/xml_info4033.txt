			<description>Rosetta is a tile laying game where players are trying to match the designs on the tiles to form a complete picture.&lt;br/&gt;The two main game types are co-op in that players are all working together to complete the design. It can be thought of as a puzzle, with square pieces, that has multiple solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On one side of the tiles, the &amp;quot;Rosetta&amp;quot;, 1-3 players work together to make a 6x6 square picture. When complete, the picture shows different coloured flowers, each made up of two corresponding square pieces. You may choose to use the 4 joker tiles as wild cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the other side, &amp;quot;Puncola&amp;quot;, you are creating a 6x6 square picture by matching the edges of the tiles with a similar pattern on an adjacent tile. At the corners of certain tiles is a 1/4 circle that is paired with 3 other tiles to form a complete circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Domino-Puncola&amp;quot; is an alternate version of the game that adds competition. Each player picks 5 tiles at random and, in turn, tries to match an edge of the &amp;quot;Puncola&amp;quot; side to a tile on the table. If that person cannot place his/her tile, he/she draws a new one. The first person to place all of his/her tiles is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
