			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superhero Gaming for Hero Kids&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capital City needs superheroes. The police are kept busy dealing with all sorts of problems. Criminals, monsters, aliens, and super villains pose constant threats. This is a city that can use all the help it can get. That&amp;rsquo;s where super kids come in!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super kids have awesome powers. They can call down lightning on their adversaries, fly over the battlefield, summon minions to do their bidding, shapeshift into powerful creatures, pick up and toss enemies, and more. Some are as tall as giants, others have wings, horns, and tails, and still others equip themselves with gadgets like water cannons and snowball bazookas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion allows you to introduce your young players to superhero roleplaying games using the Hero Kids&amp;rsquo; rule system. It provides details on the setting, inventory and skills, and 14 ready-made Super Kids characters. Super Kids can be set in any time or place. Other Hero Kids&amp;rsquo; material can be adapted by Game Masters to suit your Super Kids gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
