			<description>An indoor golf game that comes in a huge box. Inside there are three playing boards which, when placed end-to-end, make up a plan of the Old Course at St Andrews, measuring 5 feet+ by 1 foot+. This course is depicted in minute detail. Super-imposed on the course is a squared grid, with each square representing 25 x 25 yards.&lt;br/&gt;Club choice is represented by cards. You choose a club, draw a card and it will tell you how far you have hit the ball and whether it was straight or not. The playing pieces are made of metal, painted gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
