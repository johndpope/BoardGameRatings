			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Voidsparrow is an iconic symbol of mankind&amp;rsquo;s expansion into deep space, a visible reminder of human courage, ingenuity, and combat-readiness. Voidsparrows are scouts and soldiers, defenders and explorers- they are cybernetically enhanced champions of humanity. Voidsparrow flight wings patrol trade routes, protecting human startravellers from space pirates and raiders, Lifechained xeno-monsters, and hostiles of all kind, human and otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The noble starfighters are instantly recognizable thanks to their gleaming, high-gloss cyberarmor and the hawklike wings and combat helmet that are their badges of rank. A mated pair of Voidsparrow partners soaring alongside a Earth-registered sublight cargo hauler is a common sight in most human operated ports of call. And an entire flight wing of Voidsparrow warriors filling the sky during manuevers or during a large scale engagement is an unforgettable sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Voidsparrow cyborgs are an advanced class designed for use in a high-tech starfaring campaign set at Progress Level 7 or on the verge of PL 8. The Voidsparrows work best in a campaign using FTL travel. As written, Voidsparrows are intended for a slightly less realistic, comic-book inspired sci-fi setting, though they can be integrated into a &amp;lsquo;hard sci-fi&amp;rsquo; setting simply by reducing the scope of their activities from galaxy-wide to solar system-wide, as well as by describing their distinctive bionics as being slightly cruder, relatively untested prototypes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Voidsparrow characters can function in a D20 Modern campaign; they might be the first of their kind, wielding untested new bionics and establishing the traditions of their order. In this case, the first Voidsparrows might be an outgrowth of NASA or Department Seven&amp;rsquo;s space program. The Voidsparrow can also be an alien visitor or a time-traveller stranded in the past. However, while Voidsparrows can function well planetside, they shine in deep space battles, and some of their class abilities are useless without an enemy starship to blast apart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Psi-Watch and Otherverse America campaigns, Voidsparrows represent a unique breed of military cyborg, an elite branch of the world&amp;rsquo;s space navies. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to imagine these colorful, chromed cyborg knights as Psi-Watch operatives, and its just as easy to imagine them as lonely orbital warriors in the service of either the Lifer or Choicer factions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
