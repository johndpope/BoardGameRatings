							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Westerly</name>
									
			<description>Westerly is a co-operative adventure game of westward expansion. Players select a character at the beginning of the game and try to get them to California in one piece...literally. In Westerly things can go from bad to worse in a matter of minutes and your character can be injured, maimed, left to die by the group or maybe just eaten by a bear or even your own party. Ayup that's right I'm talking about cannibalism. Fear not if it all goes wrong you can rejoin the party as a different character that hops into the wagon at the next town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game involves strategy and co-operation combined with a tongue in cheek approach to all the horrible things that can happen along the perilous route out west.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiles are played in order to navigate the group to California. The game space is split into three different tracks North, South and West. Encounter cards are drawn depending on which track the group is currently in. The group must then work together to select the best way to deal with the encounter and either reap the benefits or pay the consequences of their selection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The road is treacherous filled with bandits, angry natives, predators, environmental dangers, and the list goes on. Westerly is comedic one minute and brutal the next. You never know what the exact party make up will be or what route you will have to take to go west.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Westerly is all about the story of you and your friends trying their best to make it out west and all the ridiculous things that can go wrong along the way. If ya manage to get there you will absolutely have a wild story to tell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
