							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">Il Gioco di Cotto e Mangiato</name>
									
			<description>You are part of the staff who must prepare the recipes for the next episodes of Cotto and Mangiato. When you notice that some essential ingredients for making dishes are not available, you go to the nearby market to try to recover the missing ingredients as quickly as possible, taking them from the available stock of ingredients, as an action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plan represents a market, with 11 stalls, each of which has several products. Each stall is identified by a symbol that determines the type of products on sale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who will be able to complete the higher number of recipes will win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
