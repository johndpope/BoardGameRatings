			<description>A two player game using ten square pieces per player, each with an arrow on showing the direction in which movement is allowed. These are played on a molded plastic board (the lid of the game package).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to win by taking all your opponents pieces by landing on them.  In your turn you may either move one piece 1 or 2 spaces forward in the direction the arrow show, rotate one piece by 1 or 2 points, or make a combination move of rotate 1 point and then move 1 space (or move 1 space and then rotate 1 point).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
