							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Solo Crusade</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Solo Crusade is a simple set of rules to play a solo adventure with your favourite RPG. The underlying idea is very simple: one or more pools of 'tiles' are used to represent the map, the encounters, the events and in general every possible obstacle/help during your quest.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Using a pool of tiles rather than simply roll some dices to create the adventure has a some major of advantages&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;bull; Visual representation of your travel: the tiles played on the table are much more &amp;quot; satisfactory&amp;quot; than a never-ending sequence of dice rolls.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;bull; Better control of the random factor: you can have tiles that can be drawn only once, tiles that are replaced when played.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set of rules allows you to play out solo RPG adventures on the tabletop, similar to games such as DeathMaze and the Metagaming MicroQuests series. The rules include tables and instructions for four sample adventures: The Wilderness, Hobgoblin Forest, Hunt for the Tribe, and the Black Pit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
