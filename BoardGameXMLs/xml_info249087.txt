							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Meeple Circus: Tomatoes and Awards</name>
									
			<description>TOMATOES: During the third round, before each act, one player (other that the one who is performing their act) is designated as the tomatoes thrower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That player takes 5 Tomato tokens from the reserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as the performance starts, the tomatoes thrower will throw tomatoes at the performing player (making sure not to disturb the performance) in three different cases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; anytime one or more components fall&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; anytime you hear a big cymbal crush (after 1 minute, and then every 20 seconds).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; if the performing player forgets to say &amp;laquo;tadaaaa&amp;raquo; at the end of their act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: A player cannot get more than 5 tomatoes during an act. At the end of the game, the player (or players) who got the most tomatoes loses 3 Applause, and the player (or players) who got the least tomatoes gains 3 Applause!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AWARDS At the beginning of the game, each player takes an Award token from the reserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the game ends, each player must have given their token to another player (at any time) and must explain why they did it. Examples: because that was the most amazing performance of the game, because this is a perfect execution of a challenge, because it was the funniest act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, each Award token is worth 2 Applause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player forgot (or did not want) to give their Award token, they lose 4 Applause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
