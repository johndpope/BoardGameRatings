			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FusionPlay &amp;ndash; Heroes is the first mobile NFC card game. It&amp;rsquo;s played with physical cards, each containing a Near Field Communication chip. These chips enable communication between the playing cards and a smartphone. As soon as you slide a card under the smartphone, it appears on the screen of the phone. Then the app processes the actions and visualizes the results.&lt;br/&gt;The game itself is a duel between two players like a digital-analog homage to beat-em-up games of the 16-bit era. Each player chooses one of the 4 heroes and uses the heroes&amp;rsquo; unique skills to win the battle. The game is fast paced and always motivates to play &amp;ldquo;just one more round&amp;rdquo;. All components are pocket sized, so the player can always have them with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before starting the game, the smartphone tray plates need to be placed on the table, and the smartphone should be placed on top of the tray plates. These little bars make it easy to slide the cards under the smartphone. Both players choose one hero and take all 7 cards of this hero. The app is launched, and a &amp;ldquo;Single Round&amp;rdquo; or a full match is selected. Then both players scan their hero cards in the &amp;ldquo;Choose your Heroes&amp;rdquo; screen.&lt;br/&gt;The game begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players shall choose one card, and slide it (with the face down) under the smartphone. The players will take their cards back again. The app will uncover both played cards, then process and visualize the effects of the cards. Depending on the actions taken, the players will deal damage, heal themselves, buff themselves, lower the stats of the opponent, or debuff; e.g. inflict negative conditions like burning or bleeding. Attacks can also miss or hit critically, which depends mainly upon the Dexterity values of the heroes. The game ends, when one player runs out of lives. When playing a &amp;ldquo;best of 3&amp;rdquo;, you need to win two rounds for winning the whole match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many effects from the actions depend on one or more attributes of the heroes. An example: Donar&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Into the Skies&amp;rdquo; raises the Dexterity for one round. His &amp;ldquo;Hammer Throw&amp;rdquo; adds twice the Dexerity to the damage. It may seem like a good move to raise dexterity first, and use the &amp;ldquo;Hammer Throw&amp;ldquo; one round later. A good, but also very predictable move. Each hero has 6 unique actions that all trigger different effects. Most of them trigger multiple effects at once. If you remember beat-em-up games from the good old 16-bit era, then imagine every card symbolizes one button on the controller, triggering a specific move. &lt;br/&gt;Besides using your actions in the right situations, they can also be used to sum up to powerful combos. Each hero has two unique combos and one mighty super-combo. To trigger a combo, you need to play the cards in a specific order and then activate them by playing the hero card itself. The hero card can also be used to block an opponent&amp;rsquo;s combo, or to pause one round, and regenerate some energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
