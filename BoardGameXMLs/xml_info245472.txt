			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerous Judges Guild products were marketed as &amp;quot;A Judges Guild Universal Fantasy Supplement&amp;quot;.  These products were system agnostic and intended to be usable with any then-current fantasy roleplaying game system.  To support rapid, easy, and consistent use across a variety of systems, Judges Guild developed and used a &amp;quot;Universal Fantasy&amp;quot; format of development and presentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generally speaking, this format emphasized the design commonalities of early versions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, RuneQuest, and Tunnels &amp; Trolls, while minimizing their distinctiveness.  The resulting presentation may appear at first to be a new or unique game system, but it never was intended to be usable on its own.  The format developed through time, but even in its final state it was not a complete game system.  Rather, it is a comprehensive notation system used to present scenarios and sources in a standardized, but system agnostic, fantasy format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2010, Judges Guild published this &amp;quot;final state&amp;quot; document that presents the &amp;quot;Universal Format&amp;quot;; it is made available as a free download.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note the &amp;quot;Universal Format&amp;quot; sometimes is conflated with Field Guide to Encounters (a standalone game system) - the format and the game have many commonalities but they are not equivalent (regarding the similarities - the &amp;quot;Universal Format&amp;quot; was designed to be  compatible with fantasy systems, after all).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
