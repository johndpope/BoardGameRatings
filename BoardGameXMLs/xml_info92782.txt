			<description>From the manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Forest is a game of strategy for one to six players. The object is to find the missing treasures that belong to you before the other players find theirs. Each player has three treasures to find. In multiple player games the first player to find his or her three treasures wins. When playing alone, you will be scored on the number of turns used to find them (if you aren't defeated by the Gruds).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An unlicensed version of Avalon Hill's Wizard's Quest. The major difference here are the four different playable maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
