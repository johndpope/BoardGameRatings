			<description>A simple gambling game. From around 1950, they obviously thought the kids would enjoy learning how to gamble because the box shows Mum, Dad, Gran and two young sons, all getting a thrill out of the 'race'.&lt;br/&gt;The board is a large spinner with 6 numbers. It is connected to a battery and a set of 6 lights. There is also an area where you can place your bets. After all wagers are laid, the wheel is set spinning and as it does so, the bulbs will light up every time the relevant number passes a contact point. Eventually the wheel will stop and the last light bulb to be lit will remain lit and that is the number that pays out winning bets.&lt;br/&gt;A game that seems devoid of skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
