							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Carmageddon II: Carpocalypse Now</name>
									
			<description>Carmageddon II: Carpocalypse Now is the sequel to the graphically violent vehicular combat computer game Carmageddon, released on November 30, 1998. The game was developed by Stainless Games and published by Sales Curve Interactive. (...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It features a heavy metal soundtrack with songs from Iron Maiden and instrumental tracks from Sentience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carmageddon II was one of the few racing games at the time to feature deformable models on its cars, making for more realistic dents and crashes. In fact, the player's car can even be bent in half, leaving the player to drive with only the front wheels on the ground. The car can also be sheared in half, causing retirement from the race if the damage is not repaired before the vehicle touches the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Carmageddon II: Carpocalypse Now&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
