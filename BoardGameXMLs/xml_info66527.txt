			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creatures of the Wastelands: Habitats is devoted to some of the possible environments and locations that might exist in a post-apocalyptic campaign setting and how they can be used in role-playing games in general and Goblinoid Games&amp;rsquo; Mutant Future in particular.&lt;br/&gt;Life being what it is, most of these locations have since been colonized by a variety of mutant and non-mutant life forms. Following each of the 44 described locations is a list of up to four creatures each from three different books, the Mutant Future core rulebook, and Skirmisher Publishing LLC&amp;rsquo;s Creatures of the Wastelands and Creatures of the Wastelands: Mutational Evolution, both licensed supplements to Mutant Future.&lt;br/&gt;Creatures of the Wastelands: Habitats is fully compatible with Mutant Future, as well as Labyrinth Lord and other games that use the familiar and easy-to-use &amp;ldquo;Basic D&amp;amp;D&amp;rdquo; rules introduced in the 1980s.&lt;br/&gt;Author Derek Holland is an invertebrate zoologist who has brought his extensive training and experience from the field to this and other books in the Creatures of the Wastelands series of supplements to the Mutant Future role-playing game.&lt;br/&gt;This book is fully bookmarked and designed to be printer friendly and easy-to-use and includes low-resolution screen friendly and high-resolution printer-friendly versions of both its cover surfaces and interior pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
