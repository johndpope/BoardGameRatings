			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have your PCs ever wandered down a road where you didn't have anything planned? So you pulled out a random encounter table, rolled, and *blam* - combat! What if you had another tool in your arsenal to use in these situations?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Open Spaces products aim to answer that question or at least offer some guidance as you enter those wild, uncharted areas with your PCs. The next time the party chooses to go gallivanting across the world, you can use these supplements to suggest new encounters both for good and ill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our PCs spend a lot of time on the road, traveling from location to location, and sometimes encountering a few people, beasts, or events here or there. But what happens when they're on the road and as a GM you need a bit of inspiration as to what they might find? That's where Open Spaces: On the Road... comes in!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use factors such as the purpose of the road, materials used during construction, the current condition or state of maintenance, and more, to suggest intriguing thoughts such as who might have been on the road before the PCs, where the road is headed, or who might be laying in wait just ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 6-page PDF includes three examples, eight tables, and a worksheet to help you create unique descriptions whenever you need them. Like the Little Spaces series, Open Spaces offers everything you need to help inspire you quickly. So pull out a few dice and see what's waiting on the road for your PCs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
