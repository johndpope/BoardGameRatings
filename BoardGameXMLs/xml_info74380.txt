			<description>&amp;quot;Power Blade 2, known in Japan as Captain Saver (キャプテンセイバー), is an action platform video game developed by Natsume and published by Taito for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released in North America in September 1992 and in Europe on September 29, 1992 (1992-09-29). It is the sequel to the game Power Blade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in the year 2200 and follows NOVA the protagonist from the first Power Blade game as he sets out on a mission from the U.S. Department of Defense to destroy the Delta Foundation, who has created a new cyborg that can threaten global security if it falls into the wrong hands. Just as in Power Blade, this game is similar in gameplay to the Mega Man series in that the player has the freedom to select any stage to play. It also adds some new features also seen in the Mega Man series, such as the ability of the player to slide and a wide assortment of weaponry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power Blade 2 was made first in North America and was then released in Japan with the title Captain Saver. As in the first game, the title comes from a special powerup called the &amp;quot;Power Suit&amp;quot; a suit which gives the player additional firepower capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Power_Blade_2,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
