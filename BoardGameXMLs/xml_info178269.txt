			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A drizzly moorland. Its rain-soaked slopes are crowned by clusters of colossal standing stones among which prancers commune as brayers circle unnerved. Lichenids heed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Condensed to one page for slipping in among other materials, this sandbox-oriented content is intended as an easily absorbed framework for improvisation to be adapted by the user as preferred for a wider setting and specific system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It presents core ideas and key numbers to fall back on, with general approaches that can be applied in other situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The content covers map generation on the fly for an abstracted moorland as well as suggestions for aspects of the locality, including inhabitants, behaviours, landscape features, a subtle network and a possible arrival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brayers also feature in The Ferrous Thicket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
