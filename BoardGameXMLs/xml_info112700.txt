			<description>&amp;quot;They are hungry!&lt;br/&gt;The only way to safety is to climb up. . . or is it?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dexterity based game in which your zombies are trying to reach the human of the other player. Be careful, or your zombies will tumble down and they'll have to make their way up again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game is simple: On the player's turn he or she gets a randomised zombie which must be placed against the opponent's wall. The goal is to get the pile high enough to touch the human. Players place one zombie at the time and try to catch the opponent's human before their own human is zombie food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
