							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quirks and Madness</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever created an amazing place for your campaign only to discover that you don't immediately have a collection of NPCs to fill it? Or have your PCs ever stumbled into a place you haven't had time to fully develop as a living, breathing part of the campaign?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, why not take out a handful of dice and roll up an instant NPC! Or in this case, an &amp;quot;Insta-NPC&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Insta-NPCs product line is designed to offer one or more tables to roll on to figure out a little something about the NPC you're pulling together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Insta-NPCs #2, we've taken a slightly different approach. Sometimes your NPCs come fully formed but just need that &amp;ldquo;one little thing&amp;rdquo; to set them apart from other normal folks. Everybody has their little quirks and behaviors that make them unique, so adding such qualities to our NPCs seems like a no-brainer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So we pull out a d100 and roll... 48. The poor traveler who has just come to the inn is suffering from springtime allergies and on top of all that, she's allergic to the cat. Poor girl. Perhaps her attempts to kill the PCs in their sleep will fail miserably as one of the PCs has made friends with the house cat...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond that, sometimes we need our NPCs to be a little mad (all the best ones are). But how does that madness manifest as behavior? Perhaps a key sage in town has been reduced to catatonia as a result of some post-traumatic stress or is suffering from frequent blackouts during meetings with the PCs...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this issue, you get two tables - 100 quirks and 50 signs of madness - as well as four NPCs you can quickly adapt for use in your own campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
