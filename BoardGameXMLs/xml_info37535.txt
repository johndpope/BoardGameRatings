			<description>&amp;quot;The Evil Mad Scientist Doctor Herr Guffin has left his assistants (Igor, Igor, Igor and lest we forget, Igor) in charge of his experiments while he goes to a convention on 'Evil Inventions and the Applications in Modern Society'.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The experiment in particular is a machine he designed to breed a better rat (because the kids these days had gone and invented a better mousetrap). It is a mixture of mechanical and electronic feeder/torturing device.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The object of the player (called Igor) is to have his favourite rat the biggest by the time the master returns.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This involves making sure that toggles tilt the pipes in the machine such that the food pellets go to the player's rat - and avoiding/rotating the shocking motor such that the other rats are shocked (which causes them to lose food pellets, probably through vomiting).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;There are event cards as well (things like Cardiac Arrest - fattest rat gets a chronic heart attack and dies).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
