			<description>A solitaire game where the player takes control of an American armoured brigade as it tries to battle its way from the Czech border to the German coast, fighting against an aggressive but unprepared German military machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is survival of as many American units as possible, whilst under constant German attacks from all directions, effectively a &amp;quot;tower defence&amp;quot; type game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During play, you will position your American units within the column-of-march to meet the oncoming enemy forces, trying to place the most effective units for each threat type in a position to gain most advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Separate tracks have to be managed as well. One tracks your progress towards the sea, another the number of wounded within your column and a third the opinion of the German people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A deck of event cards must be played through, each event either helping or hindering your cause, and hand management is critical during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have to strike a balance of careful manoeuvring, card play and threat management in order to reach the destination with as many of your units as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
