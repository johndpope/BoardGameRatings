							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Disgrace &amp; Favours</name>
									
			<description>In the set-making card game Disgrace &amp;amp; Favours you play the role of a socialite who is trying to gather influential people to your cause by &amp;quot;persuading&amp;quot; them to promote you. You do this by sending your servant to snoop on them, find out an embarrassing secret, then ask them nicely to help you out...or else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card in the game appears twice, and if a player has her secret revealed by an opponent she becomes disgraced and the other identical card is forfeit, even if it is in a set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disgrace &amp;amp; Favours includes an element of luck as players have to try to guess what each other are up to during the snooping phase. Set disruption is also part of the game, and ruining someone's plans will bring you a large chunk of satisfaction. Naturally you can try to defend against this by getting hold of both cards or taking the disgrace token for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
