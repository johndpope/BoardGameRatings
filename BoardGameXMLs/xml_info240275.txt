							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Into the Deep Dark</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for 4 to 6 characters levels 3 to 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The normally quiet town of Ockney's Hold finds itself in disarray as a result of a vast criminal conspiracy. When Baron Reinson, the head of state, began to act erratically and destructively, a group of brave adventurers was hired to get to the bottom of the trouble. After a harrowing investigation, the adventurers confronted the terrible brain gorger, Marlipp, and were successful in forcing him to flee from his lair in a Copper Hills mine and into the Deep Dark. But though the characters were victorious, Marlipp's threat did not end. Now, the adventurers are charged with pursuing the brain gorger into the Deep Dark and destroying him utterly- but what they don't know is that there are other even more powerful forces at play. Will these brave heroes be able to hunt down the foul Marlipp while navigating the perils of the Deep Dark? And how will they fare in negotiating with the other unknown and extremely dangerous forces at work in the underworld, many of which seek their doom?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
