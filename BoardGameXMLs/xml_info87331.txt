			<description>From the PDF introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Defenders of the Faith: A Guidebook to Clerics and Paladins Web Enhancement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defenders of the Faith: A Guidebook to Clerics and Paladins offers suggestions for holy (and unholy) quests and missions that churches might request or demand clerics undertake on behalf of their deities. Divine quests can serve as great adventure-starters, not just for clerics but for any character or party with allegiance to a patron deity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, each god has his or her own agenda in the world, so the nature of such quests can vary drastically from deity to deity. Also, as Defenders of the Faith points out, even churches devoted to the same god might emphasize different aspects of that god or parts of the god&amp;rsquo;s portfolio, and thus might hand down very dissimilar quests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let these suggestions, arranged by deity, get you started-whether you&amp;rsquo;re the player of a cleric, paladin, or other devout character, or a DM in need of a hook for your next adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
