			<description>Fry Thief is a game about poor life choices. Like that time you tried to eat healthy and ordered a salad and your friend ordered a burger and fries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Fry Thief you fight over the fries. As the salad player you're trying to play cards that let you steal fries and as the burger &amp;amp; fries player you're trying to wolf down as many fries as possible so they can't be stolen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you play one card to try to steal or eat fries. At the end of your turn you draw a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are lots of combos like &amp;quot;Distraction&amp;quot; &amp;amp; &amp;quot;Look Over There&amp;quot; that let you steal a ton of fries if you play cards in the right order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's also a lot of deck &amp;amp; hand manipulation cards like &amp;quot;I'm Not Done With That&amp;quot; which lets you pull a card out of the discard pile or &amp;quot;Insatiable Hunger&amp;quot; which lets you draw extra cards and play one immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the shared deck runs out you shuffle the discard pile and create a new deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play until all the fries have been eaten and then count up victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a 16 card micro game in a cute box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
