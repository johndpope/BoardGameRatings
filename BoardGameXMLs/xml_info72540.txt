			<description>They said hello by destroying the moon. Tides ceased to exists and wave after wave of dead fish washed up on shores the world over. You will never know the pleasure of walking in the surf during a lazy summer vacation, bug. I'm so sorry for that. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the midst of the panic over the moon they appeared. We tried to fight back but they destroyed our biggest weapons in their silos. Governments and world leaders responded in different ways. Some gave up instantly, and others resisted. The beach, bug, remember what I told you about that? It used to be a lot farther away, but that was before they made an example of it. All in all, it was a hell of a way to find out that we were not alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That was about 15 years ago. Since then, we've had some victories, but far too many failures. The biggest op your daddy was involved in was faking the crash on Mars a few years back. See, bug, we WANTED that ship to take heavy fire and crash, right where it did. There were enough diggers aboard to set up the underground Mars base. Last time daddy was there he got to see a new weapon, based on their tech. Hopefully we can have it ready soon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is why I have to go, bug. Mars needs people like me to sneak in, hide in the Moon belt, deliver supplies and workers, and get back home without being seen. And I promise you that one day I will take you to see the rings of Saturn, when we can fly throughout the system safely and freely. It'll be just you and me. I should be back soon. I will miss my little bug, bunches and bunches! Daddy will always l-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;END TRANSMISSION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In SNEAK, players take on the role of heroic smugglers looking to transport supplies up to the secret Resistance base on Mars.  On each turn, you will have an amount of energy (action points) that you can use to maneuver and move your ship around the board.  However, any leftover energy is converted in cargo cards, that you draw into hand.  Asteroids will then semi-randomly move around the board, blocking your way or revealing your hiding space.  Then, the aliens will move and attempt to destroy you.  Each time you get hit by an alien you will have to lose cargo cards- or else you will have to start your smuggling run again.  Upon a successful run, you will score notoriety points based on the cargo you brought and can spend it to increase your maximum energy, maximum cargo (hand size), and number of special powers (mods), or to buy new mods.&lt;br/&gt;The most notorious smuggler at the end of 10 rounds is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
