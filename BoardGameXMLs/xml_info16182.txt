							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beat the Warden</name>
									
			<description>The object of the game is to get all your four cars safely parked in a meter bay.  This game dates from the 1960s, when metered parking was relatively new in the UK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board shows a network of one- and two-way roads and a number of parking bays.  Using numbers rolled on 2 dice the players must move each of their cars from the starting garage to a bay. Exact moves only, and no reversing!  There are some traffic lights on the board which at times allow or deny access along certain roads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player's turn consists of move one or two cars, then take a card. The cards are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking meter - collect 4 of these&lt;br/&gt;Warden - immediately pay &amp;pound;1 for each parked car&lt;br/&gt;Tame Warden - retain and use to counteract a Warden&lt;br/&gt;Speeding - immediately pay a &amp;pound;2 fine&lt;br/&gt;Traffic Lights - change the lights&lt;br/&gt;Bank - retain until able to stop outside a Bank, then collect &amp;pound;5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can bump another parked car out of a bay, unless the owner has a Meter card for each car parked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
