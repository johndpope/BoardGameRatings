							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thomas The Tank Engine &amp; Friends (Computer)</name>
									
			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's full steam ahead once again for Thomas, he's had a busy week at the Station and now it looks likely this week is going to be just as busy. The Fat Controller's head is spinning with all the special trips he has to organise. It is a good job that he has Thomas and his friends to rely upon. He calls Thomas over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Now Thomas,&amp;quot; he says, &amp;quot;I have selected some very important jobs for you to do this week. I know that you will do your best and that you will be very careful.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Oh yes, sir&amp;quot;, says Thomas, &amp;quot;You know you can trust me, I want to be a really useful engine.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;These are the jobs you must do.&amp;quot; the Fat Controller replies, &amp;quot;Take the children to the seaside, take a tractor over to the station by the broken bridge, take some medicine to the hospital, deliver some logs to the sawmill and coal to the power station, deliver the mail and finally take some oil over to the refinery. Now there is a lot to do so do not waste time. You can do the jobs in any order but each one must be finished before the sun goes down.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;All right sir, I had better get started.&amp;quot; says Thomas as he hurries over to the turn table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
