							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GURPS Fantasy (Third Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you looking for a good fantasy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From ancient myths to popular films, stories of heroes and magic have captured the human imagination. Now GURPS Fantasy offers roleplayers a comprehensive guide to the entire genre. Building on the flexible, streamlined Fourth Edition rules, it lets you develop a campaign to explore the world of your favorite book or film - or create a new one from your own dreams. The main emphasis is on historical fantasy, in settings from the Bronze Age to the Renaissance, but the principles apply to any fantasy setting, from the prehistoric past to the remote future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there's more here than theoretical guidelines and toolkits. You'll find examples of imaginary plants and animals, unique monsters, nonhuman races, occupations, spells, and enchanted objects, ready to use in your own campaign - or to use as models for inventing your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complete campaign setting, Roma Arcana, is ready to use in your own campaign. It can stand on its own, or fit into the Infinite Worlds background from GURPS Fourth Edition. Send a band of adventurers on impossible missions in a magical Roman Empire, as they struggle to win honor and hold back the darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll find help in running your campaign here, in Roma Arcana or any other setting: advice on creating balanced parties, devising scenarios to challenge them, and using the game rules to achieve dramatic effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take the most flexible, most consistent game rules system available, and use it to run the campaign you dream of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Fantasy requires the GURPS Basic Set, Fourth Edition. The information and ideas here will work with any fantasy game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
