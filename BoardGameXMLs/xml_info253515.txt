							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legio VI Constantiniani</name>
									
			<description>Legio VI Constantiniani is a set of miniatures wargames rules aimed to allow large battles of Roman Late Imperial period (AD 250-600) to be resolved relatively quickly. It's meant for 6mm figures but could easily be adapted to larger (or smaller!) figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are derived from the same designer's Comitatus set of Dark Ages rules, but slimmed down to allow larger battles to be fought in less time. Troops are classed a relatively small number of troop types with minimal differentiation based on equipment; the focus is on troop quality and, especially, generals' limited means of controlling their forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are freely available from the designer's webpage, along with sister sets covering adjoining periods:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legio VI Julia Augusta, for 100 BC to AD 250&lt;br/&gt;Legio VI Macedonica, for 400-100 BC&lt;br/&gt;Legio VI Diadochi, for Alexander and the Successors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
