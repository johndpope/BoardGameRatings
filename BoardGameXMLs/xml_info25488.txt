			<description>This game was published in the German zine &amp;quot;P&amp;ouml;ppel-Revue&amp;quot; 6/86. According to the description, the original title of this game from Derek Carver was &amp;quot;Loot&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6 or 8 (!) players start with 2 treasure hunters and 1 guard in the middle the board to search for 16 treasures of different value. The board has 8 rings with an increasing number of spaces on them; the 16 treasures are placed at some of the 28 outer spaces of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tokens can have 4 different colors and 4 different shapes in a 8-player's game (3 and 3 in a 6-player's game), but each player has 3 equal tokens. That means, one player may have 3 blue round tokens, another 3 red square tokens, a next 3 yellow hex tokens, and so on - each color and shape on a total of 6 tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unique is the idea, that treasures can only be dug out by more than 1 player! How many and what kind of tokens are needed, is marked on each treasure chest, which covers the treasure (e.g. 3 tokens of different shape, or 4 tokens of 4 different colors).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once, a treasure is dug out, it belongs to the whole group of tokens, but it must be transported back to the middle of the game board, where only 1 player can claim it. Needless to say, that several alliances, (broken) promises and other bluffs are usual, especially since the guard pieces can attack the hunters to steal the treasures from them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends, when all treasures are dug out, or when one player has claimed a certain amount of treasures - or when a certain time limit is reached.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
