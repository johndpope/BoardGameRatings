			<description>The emperor and its royal household walk proudly in the palace garden. Everyone made the cunning weavers manufacture a marvelous dress for him. By great fear to be considered as too stupid neither the emperor nor its officials dare to throw a view on their shade. There they can recognize that they are naked in reality. Fortunately a small boy, who sits in a tree in the palace garden, and the players don't let themselves deceive by the stupid trick of the weavers. Gradually the boy and the players hold the naked image before the faces of the vain emperor and its attendants. A little to search they must thereby, and the cunning weavers try likewise to donate confusion. Who finds three of the twelve naked images first, exposed the treacherous weavers and wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
