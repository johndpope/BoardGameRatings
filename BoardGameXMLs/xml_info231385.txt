			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seven Suitors&amp;nbsp;is series of three games designed by Chris Wray.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four-player game, Seven Suitors, is a partnership trick-taking card game.&amp;nbsp; The game uses a custom deck of seven suits with eight cards each.  The first suit is numbered 1-7, the second 2-8, the third 3-9, and so on and so forth, with two of each 7 card in each suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seven Suitors is a &amp;quot;marriage&amp;quot; trick game, and the goal is to be the first team to capture and &amp;ldquo;mark off&amp;rdquo; all seven suits. &amp;nbsp;To mark off a suit, you and/or your partner must capture both 7s in a given suit in the same hand (i.e. not necessarily the same trick).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start the hand by passing one card to each other player.   The player with the &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo; card will lead the first trick, but he or she need not play that card.&amp;nbsp; The suit of the first card led by the start player becomes the &amp;ldquo;trump&amp;rdquo; for the hand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a card is led, players must follow suit if possible.  If not possible, they can play any card.&amp;nbsp; The highest card of the trump suit will win the trick, but absent a trump, highest card of the suit led wins.&amp;nbsp; In the event both sevens of a suit are played and would win the trick, the first seven played wins.&amp;nbsp; The winner of the trick leads the next trick.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;All captured sevens are public knowledge.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play until one side has marked off all seven suits, which will generally take multiple hands.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two alternative end conditions included in the game rules.  Additionally, four special cards -- each with a different power -- are included as an additional variant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anti-Cupid is is a trick-taking game for five players where each player gets a chance to act as Anti-Cupid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets dealt 12 cards.&amp;nbsp; One of the players --- the player with the &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo; card&amp;rdquo; --- will be the first to act as Anti-Cupid.  The first and third players from his or her left will be partners for this hand.  The second and fourth players from his or her left will also be partners for this hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to have the most points after five hands.  The player acting as Anti-Cupid will rotate, so each player will take on the role once.  &lt;br/&gt;If you are not Anti-Cupid, a point is earned for each &amp;ldquo;marriage trick&amp;rdquo; you and your partner capture. &amp;nbsp;A marriage trick means you and/or your partner captured both of the 7s in a suit in the same hand (i.e. not necessarily the same trick).  Additionally, all players that are not Anti-Cupid earn points for each marriage trick Anti-Cupid captures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are Anti-Cupid, a point is earned for each suit where a marriage trick is not formed by the end of the hand.  Card play is similar to that of Seven Suitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Traitor of Love is a trick-taking social deduction game for six players.&amp;nbsp; Players are on teams of three matchmakers, competing against each other to see who can make the most marriages.  But there&amp;rsquo;s a traitor in their midst that is helping the other team make matches!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players sit with members of the opposing team to their left and right.  Each player gets dealt 10 cards.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, from one of the sets of suit tracking cards, six suits are selected, making sure to include hearts.  One of the players will be the Traitor of Love (the &amp;ldquo;Traitor&amp;rdquo;); he or she is the player that receives the hearts tracking card.  The other five players will be plain Matchmakers; they will have received tracking cards representing other suits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After cards are dealt, each player passes one card to each other player of the opposing team (i.e. each player passes three cards and receives three cards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to have the most points at the end of the game, which comes when one player has more than 15 points. &amp;nbsp;If you are a Matchmaker, a point is earned for each &amp;ldquo;marriage trick&amp;rdquo; your team earns. &amp;nbsp;A marriage trick means you captured both of the 7s in a suit in the same hand (i.e. not necessarily the same trick). If you&amp;rsquo;re the Traitor, a point is earned for each &amp;ldquo;marriage trick&amp;rdquo; the other team earns. &lt;br/&gt; Additionally, for Matchmakers on the Traitor&amp;rsquo;s team, if they correctly identify the Traitor at the end of the hand, they get 2 bonus points.  The Traitor loses 1 point for each teammate correctly identifying him, but he gains a point for each teammate not guessing him.  Card play is similar to that of Seven Suitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
