			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are not alone in the Universe, but we have few friends. As we emerged on the galactic stage, we found a universe stripped bare of sentient life by a great Plague, leaving only the wild beasts and twisted plague horrors wandering the ruined hulks of lost civilizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are the Surveyors. We explore the uncharted sectors of space and hunt these ruins for the treasures they contain and the riches they might bring to what sentient life remains. We are not brave, merely foolhardy and desperate. Those who survive become rich beyond dreams. Very few survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hulks &amp;amp; Horrors is a science-fiction roleplaying game of galactic exploration and adventure for 2 or more players ages 13 and up.
