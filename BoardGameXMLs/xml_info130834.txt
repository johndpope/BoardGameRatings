			<description>Blue Toad Murder Files (full title, Blue Toad Murder Files: The Mysteries of Little Riddle) is a murder mystery puzzle video game developed and published by the British game company Relentless Software. The game is episodic and the first instalment was released for the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Store in December 2009. The entire &amp;quot;season&amp;quot; of the game, Blue Toad Murder Files: The Mysteries of Little Riddle, includes six separate episodes.Support for PlayStation Move was added in December 2010 (update 2.0).&lt;br/&gt;The game is for one to four players and leans towards TV murder mysteries such as Agatha Christie's Poirot, Midsomer Murders and Jonathan Creek with &amp;quot;witnesses, alibis [and] motives&amp;quot; rather than being a logic puzzle like Cluedo. The game sees the player investigate murders and interrogate residents in the country village of Little Riddle. Aspects of the game have been compared to the Professor Layton series of games, regarding its setting and puzzle solving game mechanic, but it differs from the Layton games in that the puzzles in Blue Toad are more closely linked to the game's storyline. At various points the game questions the player about their investigation and key plot points to check that they were paying attention. Actor Tom Dussek voiced all the 22 characters (+dog) in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Blue Toad Murder Files&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
