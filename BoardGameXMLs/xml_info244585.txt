			<description>Con Sequence &lt;br/&gt;an Abstract Strategic Memory Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview: Abstract Strategic Memory&lt;br/&gt;Game time: 10-25 min&lt;br/&gt;Number of players: 2&lt;br/&gt;Ages: 6+&lt;br/&gt;Art &amp;amp; game design: Quadrante Isegrim&lt;br/&gt;Game board: 4x4 grid&lt;br/&gt;Game pieces: 7 black discs + 7 white discs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: At the start of the game, players hide their discs from the other players eyes. Keep the discs hidden throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players will take turns placing one disc on the grid upside down, goal is to get your own pieces in a row (or rows) and the other player's discs spread out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At your turn: Place one disc on an empty square the board OR move one disc (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) on the board to an adjacent empty square OR place and push a row of discs one square aside (making the disc already on the board slide one square in chosen direction (horizontally, vertically or diagonally). Discs that fall out of the grid because of this push is picked up by the pushing player regardless of the color of the disc. Discs picked up may be seen and used by that player, place it among the concealed discs or in your palm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make the push discs move, there have to be an empty square where to place the pushing disc at start of the pushing. You could not start off grid pushing a row or column only from an empty spot within the grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Final scoring: As all discs is placed on the board, you flip them over and score points. You score points both horizontally, vertically and diagonally, you score your own symbol discs and disregard blank discs.Note that you score regardless of color of the disc as long as it got your symbol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rows of symbols could cross, and the disc that is in the joint of both rows counts as part of both rows when scoring (both horizontally, vertically and diagonally).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One isolated disc = 0 points&lt;br/&gt;Two in a row = 2 points&lt;br/&gt;Three in a row = 3 points&lt;br/&gt;Four in a row = 4 points&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinations of above 2-12 points&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
