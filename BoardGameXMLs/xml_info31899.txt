			<description>The game is the successor of the Global Air Race game from the same company.&lt;br/&gt;Game components are an 8 inch metal globe with large numbered and colour-coded base with integrated two-dimensional spinner, 4 coloured magnetic jet planes, 16 flight plan and 32 chance and a large lot of fuel cards, play money and a transparent distance finder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have to round the globe first, starting in New York in eastern direction. On the way you have to land on 4 pre-dealt cities depicted on the flight plan cards. You encounter hazards and have to refuel your plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to move you whirl the whole globe (hence the name of the game), and the two-dimensional spinner at the globe base connected to the globe shows on the inside what chance cards and hazards are encountered and if and how much you can refuel. On the outside is shown how many hours (points)you can fly and how much fuel is consumed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And there is also a colour code depicted on the globe base, which adapts to the various countries spread all over the &amp;quot;world&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;You have to take all these informations into account to work out the best route with the help of the transparent distance finder depicting the travel distances point-to-point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also some extra advantages to gain achieving some goals during your travels (such as crossing the equator).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
