							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Laboratory of Raoul Footpad</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure module is meant to assist the DM with providing content to their players.  This adventure is intended to run in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, but it can be compatible with any campaign setting, especially Ravenloft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure also features a new creature: The Greater Nothic!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Need to get your player characters to a higher level before beginning your next adventure?  Want a way to get some loot into the hands of your players before they start yet another long adventure?  Or do you just need a little more content in the campaign you already have going?  Then Sword Coast Side Quests is for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the hills near the Sword Coast is an old, abandoned temple to the goddess Mystra.  A young halfling wizard named Raoul Footpad finds the abandoned temple and converts it into a laboratory.  One day, Raoul returns home to the village of Prairiedale, only to find his parents gravely ill.  With few options for their recovery, Raoul becomes obsessed with creating a magic spell to cure them.  He and his assistant work feverishly to find the right magic, but instead they release calamity upon this portion of the world.  Raoul is transformed into a hideous monster, and undead now inhabit the laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module is intended for 4 to 6, 3rd level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
