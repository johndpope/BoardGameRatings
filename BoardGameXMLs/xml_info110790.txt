			<description>The Commodore PET (&amp;quot;Personal Electronic Transactor&amp;quot;) was a home/personal computer produced from 1977 by Commodore International.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initial model, PET 2001, was announced at the Winter CES in January 1977 and the first 100 units were shipped later that year in October.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PET's 6502 processor controlled the screen, keyboard and any peripherals connected to one of the computer's expansion ports. The PET was essentially a single-board computer with discrete logic, driving a small built-in monochrome monitor with 40&amp;times;25 character graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the PET 2001 was fairly successful, there were frequent complaints about the tiny calculator-like keyboard, often referred to as a &amp;quot;chiclet keyboard&amp;quot; because the keys resembled the gum candy. The keyboard issues were addressed in the upgraded &amp;quot;dash N&amp;quot; versions of the 2001, which eliminated the built-in Datassette (cassette tape recorder) in favor of an external cassette recorder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;dash N&amp;quot; units included a much larger keyboard with a full stroke motion. Internally a newer motherboard was used, along with an upgrade from static RAM to dynamic RAM. Models were available with 8, 16, or 32 KB of memory, known as the 2001-8N, 2001-16N or 2001-32N, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Commodore PET&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
