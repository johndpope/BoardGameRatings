							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Duel at Dawn</name>
									
			<description>In Duel at Dawn Players pit their fighters on an island into a duel with rapiers, that soon becomes a duel of wits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with players configuring their fighters by buying points in attributes and assigning one or more skills.  The configuration of a fighter reflects his strengths and weaknesses.&lt;br/&gt;Combat is played with the Damage Deck, so players have to outsmart their opponents in order to defeat them and to achieve the mission's goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the rules come in English, the game per se is completely language independant and relies on icons only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
