			<description>Fire up the cannons! Six enemy fleets are all competing to reign the high seas, and it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to maneuver your ships and cannons to sink as many key targets as possible. Will you be able to carry your fleet to victory?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of a grid of ship and submarine tokens, along with a command ship and cannon belonging to each player. In each round, players schedule actions on their player dashboards according to the amount of time required to carry them out. Then, each time slot is resolved simultaneously &amp;mdash; actions include loading powder and cannonballs, maneuvering ships and cannons, and commanding the fleet of ships of a player's own color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a ship or submarine is hit by the appropriate size of cannonball, the token is retrieved. If a player hits another player's command ship, the player must give up a token to the player who fired the shot. The player with the most points at the end of the game is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
