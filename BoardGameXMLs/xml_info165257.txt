							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Forgotten Monument</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Point Landfall marks the end of the mighty Moonshield. The saga goes that Mardain the explorer made landfall here. A monument to him stands as a tall reminder. But, that inscription? &amp;ldquo;In memory of the lies men tell to gain power?&amp;rdquo; What can it mean? Therein lies a tale of deception and fraud. It gets woven all together and !surprise! out comes a parasite that bestows good upon the human race and doles out punishment on evil. Did Mardain leave his mark on the world, or, did he just get used by the world to make itself a better place? Blasphemer&amp;rsquo;s Blood makes a difference, of course. But nature has its own devices. Was Mardain just a spore eating device of nature? Play #70 if you dare. But, please! Hold the mushrooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
