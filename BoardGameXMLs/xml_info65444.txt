			<description>The players will be able to use the card game, CerebralFlatulence, to jump start the creative process and find &amp;quot;fresh&amp;quot; views to solving problems. This game will enable the learners to avoid &amp;quot;white fright,&amp;quot; the fear of starting a creative piece, and will provide a method for gaining new insights into otherwise mundane topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The learners are enrolled in the arts. The game will be used initially as a part of the creative writing / graphic design class at the high school level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner will be determined by point scores. The team with the highest point value will win. This game can be limited to one round, or may continue over a longer period of time, depending on the gaming environment. When used in a class setting, this game may easily become part of the grading process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
