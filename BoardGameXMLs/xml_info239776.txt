			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Herein are 5 unique alien races to further expand your adventures in the Fractured Future&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Ethernauts- post-human descendants of explorers altered forever by the ghostly legacy of a dead civilization, Ethernauts navigate the infinite mists of the Deep Ethereal, persuing grim quests and ancient vendettas inherited from eons long past.&lt;br/&gt;    Ezzana- forged in the lava vents of a hostile planet, the Ezzana were forced to flee to the stars in order to survive. Master gunsmiths, the Ezzana use specially crafted rifles to hunt the titanic predators that roam their blighted planet. &lt;br/&gt;    Qlaarpians- these amphibians lost control of their homeworld to the hated Aboleth mudlords, and now fight a crusade to reclaim their planet from the demons that rule their seas.  &lt;br/&gt;    Ripper Dogs- they are known for cruelty, but that reputation isn't entirely fair. These creatures seek progress and self-improvement: higher states of being; perfection of flesh in metal. Only the evil ones exhibit wanton, sadistic cruelty for its own sake. &lt;br/&gt;    Un Men- cold traders, holo-mutes, these mockeries of humanity visit frontier space stations and smugglers' moon bases, trading exotic pharmaceuticals for cryogenically preserved human bodies -paying extra for the living kind. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;new alien homeworlds, spacecrafts, and much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
