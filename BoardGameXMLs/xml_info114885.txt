			<description>Put your slot car on the tracks and push the pedal to the metal in Slot Car Gran Prix, a fast and furious FREE racing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Burn rubber and reach the finish line before your opponent. With a click of your mouse, you're off as the green light strikes. But watch out for those curves, because if you hit them too fast, you'll fly off the track and lose valuable time, and ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Select from five fabulous cars and fifteen outrageous racetracks as you drive for total domination. It takes a steady hand and nerves of steel. Can you come out on top and claim the winner's circle?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
