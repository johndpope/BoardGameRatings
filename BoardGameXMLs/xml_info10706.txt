			<description>-From the Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALL THE ACTION OF GRAND PRIX RACING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Wheelspin, the board game that recreates all the thrills and spills of Grand Prix racing. Your objective is to be first past the chequered flag at the end of the race. You'll stand the best chance of winning if you 'read' the race in advance, avoiding hazards and penalties wherever possible and by forcing your opponents to make mistakes and incur delays and penalties. After only a few games you'll be reading the track like an expert - and beating your fellow drivers to that magnum of champagne! Why not run a series of races with your friends and family and create you own world championship&amp;hellip;.&lt;br/&gt; Of Particular note:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-The game is heavily luck based. A flick-spinner is used for movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
