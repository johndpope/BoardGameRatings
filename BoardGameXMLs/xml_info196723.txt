			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One is a Mortal, the Other, a God. Both are Legends!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Celestial (PL 15) is an alien of mixed heritage with vast powers that could turn him into a nearly unstoppable tyrant. But he was raised in a simple farm life by parents who loved him, and imbued in him a strong sense of right and wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Geist(PL 9) is a legend dating back to World War Two. A soldier, keen criminologist, and cunning infiltrator, the Geist has clung to the shadows for a generation to keep an aura of mystery that gives him an edge against the depraved agents of the underworld.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Should they ever combine forces, no foe is likely to escape from justice at the hands of the Legend&amp;rsquo;s Finest!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Powered Legends. Because sometimes what you need is a character everyone will recognize, even if they&amp;rsquo;ve never met her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
