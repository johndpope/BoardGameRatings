			<description>In keeping with the spirit of the Rocky Mountain fur trade, Each of the four game pieces represents a fur brigade:&lt;br/&gt;1) The Rocky Mountain Fur Company&lt;br/&gt;2) Manuel Lisa's Missouri Fur Company&lt;br/&gt;3) The Mountain Fur Company&lt;br/&gt;4) The men of the Hudson's bay company&lt;br/&gt;As a player you move out across the wide Missouri river into the wild, free country in search of Fur and riches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to return to one's starting point with as many packs of Beaver pelts or Trade goods, or their equivalent in blood brother cards and fort ownership, as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played until each of the players has moved over all of his hunting trails, designated by his particular color, through the Rendezvous twice, and back home. Each trapper move along spaces, encounters adventure or situation generated by pulling  cards from a deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
