			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An indie 2-player full information abstract. Players each have one of two identical set of 5 viruses, starting on one half of the board. Each turn, players must move one of their viruses according to that virus movement capacity. The goal of the game is to either delete each of your own viruses by stepping on the delete-square on the opponent's board half, or block the opponents every possible move &amp;ndash; this is a victory by error&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game comes as a folded A4 cardboard. Half is the rules, the other half is cut out to form pieces and board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
