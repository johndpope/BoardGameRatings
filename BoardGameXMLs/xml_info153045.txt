							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">From the Laboratory of the Mad Wizard Shadmar (Revision 2)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the realm of magic there are items that are created for both good and evil. At times, whether it is due to a degree of ineptness or just pure greed the outcome of some of these items are not quite what was intended. These items are considered to be cursed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collection of magical items is the continuing legacy of the Mad Wizard Shadmar. Shadmar was both full of greed with a lust for power and slightly insane. Whether it was because of the magical power he possessed or because of something genetic no one knows for sure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of these items has its own unique power, as well as its own individualistic history and curse. These items also include adventure hooks to aide the Campaign Master in his endeavor to add these paraphernalia to his current game. They are sure to add a different twist to your game, and have your players cursing you the whole time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revision 2 has been updated to include adventure hooks, item creation costs, and other pertinent data to make it easier for CMs to add them to their gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
