			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a long lost treasure of tavern legend is found in an old mine, the local town of Beer Gnomes becomes embroiled in a battle of Brothers and recipes. Called in to find the item and restore the peace, the Party must figure out how to party with the undead, schmooze with the Gods and endure horrifying and deadly new foods that have a habit of fighting back! Can our heroes save the day while still walking in a straight line? Will Loki forgive their folly? And most importantly, does this color of green make the warrior look fat? Find these answers, along with plenty of bubbly action and adventure, when you sample &amp;quot;The Beer of the Gods!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Episode 33 - The Gods of Beer Town&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: Two beer brewing brothers have divided their father's brewery in two, and are sending out the party to find the Aegir Brewing Kettle. They must face off against angry dwarves, berserking undead, and the Norse God Loki. Then top it all off with the party having to be drunk for the entire adventure. Plus, there is a good chance everyone turns into frogs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
