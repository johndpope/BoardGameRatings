			<description>The Hundred Years War&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1337, based on the strength of his claim to the French throne as a direct descendant of Philip IV&lt;br/&gt;through his mother, Isabella of France, Edward III of England refused to do more than simple (non-liege)&lt;br/&gt;homage for Guyenne to the French King Philip VI.&lt;br/&gt;The resulting war that started shortly afterward between France and England continued, with periodic&lt;br/&gt;truces, until 1453.&lt;br/&gt;The Battle of Cr&amp;eacute;cy, fought on Saturday, August 26, 1346 was the first of several significant battles&lt;br/&gt;during which the longbow triumphed over crossbowmen and armoured knights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Battle of Cr&amp;eacute;cy is a game for two to five players in which you and your opponents play French&lt;br/&gt;knights trying to defeat the Englishmen and to get as much fame and honour as possible while doing so.&lt;br/&gt;Honour is gained by showing off and dispatching English footmen.&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in two separate parts: the night before the battle and the battle itself.&lt;br/&gt;When the battle is done all the player&amp;rsquo;s fame is counted and the knight whom has gained the most&lt;br/&gt;honour is the winner - even though he might be dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
