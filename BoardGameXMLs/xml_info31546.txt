							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mystery Board</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Watch the mystery ball magically select the correct answer. Over 100 questions on history, sports, science, entertainment and the world around us. Scoring board for competition play.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A two-player trivia game in which the object is to be the first player to answer ten questions correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a plastic board with an oval area to place the question/answer sheets and two scoring boards which are used to track how many correct answers each player has given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;mystery ball&amp;quot; is clear plastic dome mounted on a black base. At the edge of the base is a round hole or window which allows one to look through the base and onto the question/answer sheet. The mystery ball is placed on the question side of the board and turned to reveal one of the eight questions through the window in the base. The player then chooses an answer from among the eight answers. The mystery ball is then moved to the answer side of the board and it automatically (and mysteriously) turns to reveal the correct answer through the window in the base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The question/answer sheets are double sided, providing eight questions in various categories, such as Space and Space Travel, Popular Music, Movies, Science and Inventors, Astrological Pairs, The World's Mostest, Where in the World, General Knowledge, Facts on Wheels, The Arts, Sports, History, Geography, Legends and Myths, and Who Is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publication date is approximate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
