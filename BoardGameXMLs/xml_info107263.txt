			<description>Grand Prix Manager 2 is a 1996 Formula 1 management simulation for Windows systems and is based on its prequel, Grand Prix Manager. It was developed by Edward Grabowski Communications Ltd and published by Microprose, and it is licensed by FIA to have real statistics for the 1996 Formula One season. A sequel, Grand Prix World, was released in 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is composed of long and short term &amp;quot;contracts&amp;quot;, long term games being made up of 10 seasons of F1 (in game from 1996&amp;ndash;2005) whilst short term challenges dictated a specific outcome to be met over 1, 2 or 3 seasons, failure of these resulting in being fired and losing the game.[2] In long term challenges, the only way to lose the game is that the player's team goes bankrupt. The game can be played on the same computer with one to four players in a hotseat mode, assigning turns for the players to make their decisions. Before the start of a long term scenario, the player(s) may freely edit the teams and personnel to their liking by using a simple in-game editor. Short term scenarios cannot be modified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game the player(s) must hire &amp;amp; dismiss personnel, negotiate with sponsors to secure the team's finances, control the research of new parts to stay competitive, negotiate contracts with engine, fuel, and spare parts suppliers, control testing and set up the car according to hints given by the drivers.&lt;br/&gt;The race screen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before a race weekend the player(s) can choose whether he/she wants to see the different sessions or just skip them, thus allowing the game to simulate the results. The car setup can also be altered during these sessions. Before the race the fuel &amp;amp; tyre strategy of both cars has to be set, the game giving a suggestion to the player(s) which can be freely modified.Stirling Moss provides commentary during the race.  After the race certain news stories based on the race's results and current game events are displayed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Grand Prix Manager 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
