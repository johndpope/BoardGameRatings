			<description>Ultraman: Towards the Future (ウルトラマン Urutoraman, &amp;quot;Ultraman&amp;quot;) is a multi-platform combat-oriented video game based on the then-recent Ultra Series, Ultraman: Towards the Future. This game has received mostly negative reviews due to its high difficulty and its poor graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cast in the role of the Ultraman, the player must defeat many of the same monsters that appeared in the original TV series.  Taking the appearance of a one-on-one fighting game, Ultraman can punch, kick, and grapple his opponent, in addition to using a variety of various special moves that must be charged. However, in order to actually defeat his opponent, Ultraman must deplete their continually-recharging life bar, and at that moment hit them with the Specium Beam (which is his most powerful attack). As the game continues, different enemies may develop ways to evade the final blow.  Ultraman must adapt to their changing ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ultraman: Towards the Future (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
