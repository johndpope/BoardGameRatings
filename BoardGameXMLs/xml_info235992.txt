							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Battle of Changsha</name>
									
			<description>The Battle of Changsha is a two-player, operational level game of the second (September to October 1941) battle for Changsha, China, capital of the Hunan Province. The second battle in 1941, resulted in the city being captured by the Japanese, and then being recaptured by the Chinese 9th Army Group commanded by Gen. Xue Yue. The third battle was originally intended by the Japanese to gain control of the city and prevent Chinese forces from reinforcing the British forces engaged in the defense of Hong Kong. When Hong Kong fell on 25 December, the Japanese decided to continue the offensive to gain control of Changsha thereby dealing a major blow to the Chines war effort. Ground units represent battalions and regiments with artillery and Japanese air power being represented with the use of fire support markers. Each hex is 3km across and each game turn represents 1 to 2 days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
