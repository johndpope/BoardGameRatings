							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">7ombie TV: For Ghouls and Colleges</name>
									
			<description>This is a expansion to the game 7ombie TV which is a spin off to 7TV, but has a fraction of Ghouls and school girls as every system needs one. Players make their force spending points and following rules on the number of hero's and sheep they can have as there are three levels of characters. The game is won when one side completes the objective, points can be scored for other task completed during the game such as killing of zombies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Ghouls and Colleges brings a UK twist and some minor misdemeanors to 7ombieTV. Play cannibal ghouls such as the twisted Number 11 or two new survivor casts &amp;ndash; the Girls of St Searle&amp;rsquo;s or the vicious Borstal Boys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player forms a fraction using the type cast up to a point cost. Cards are given at random to add a little flavor as weapons or one off effects. The games will have different objectives to complete and bonus points for completing mini task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
