			<description>What Is It?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a card game of deception, confusion, and chaos. Jack the Ripper mixes the interplay of party games like Werewolf and Mafia, the psychology of games like poker, and the action of games like your favorite collectible card game. On top of that, we fit all of this into a primer game that takes fifteen minutes or less to play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Jack the Ripper, you play a character that has been attending an aristocrat's party in the year 1888. The main event of the party is a scavenger hunt and you and your group of fellow scavenger hunters are one item away from completing the hunt. The only problem is, you've been locked in a dark warehouse and one of your team mates is a celebrity known as The Whitechapel Murderer, Jack the Ripper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have used many strategies to get ahead in Jack the Ripper. Some have found ingenious card combinations that help them race to victory. Many have sat back quietly and watched while others are picked off one by one. A few have gotten deeply involved in questioning the other players, trying to sleuth out which one is Jack. Some industrious players have learned all of the character names and are quick to claim to be one of the other scavenger hunters, hiding the fact that they are really the Ripper himself.&lt;br/&gt;Jack the Ripper is mechanically easy to play and it doesn't take long to get through a game but it is dynamic enough to allow for many potential strategies in both the cards you play and the style in which you play them. So you choose, take a pot shot at one of your opponents or talk it out and then decide who to attack!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World of Jack&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you are trapped in a dark warehouse and you know that one of your group members is the notorious Jack the Ripper, you just don't know which one. The closest thing you can grab to protect yourself is from the bag of scavenger hunt items that your group has collected. Using these items, the partygoers try to find out who is Jack and destroy him before he destroys all of them.&lt;br/&gt;If Jack can murder all of the partygoers before they murder him, Jack the Ripper wins the hunt and prowls on in infamy. If Jack falls first, then the remaining partygoers share in the victory and become the heroes of Whitechapel. But would be heroes beware, Jack has some tricks up his sleeve to help take you out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn More at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://cryptmonkeygames.com/games/jacktheripper&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://cryptmonkeygames.com/games/jacktheripper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
