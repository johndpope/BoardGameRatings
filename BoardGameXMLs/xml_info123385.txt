			<description>The Biz is a ZX Spectrum management simulation/strategy computer game from 1984 where the player got to manage his own rock band.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players set up their rock band with gigs, make them rehearse new songs, and hire a recording studio for producing new albums. The player starts out with no talent or money and an agent must be hired in order to better co-ordinate the band. The stage presence of the band and the fanbase are improved with every gig performed. School dances and YMCAs are the first places that accept the player's newly-formed band.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Real television stations are included: a band from either Swansea or Cardiff would perform on S4C while a local band from Coventry would get promoted on Central Television. Players can sometimes record a session with John Peel; whose broadcasting influence opened up new bands to people between the ages of 20 and 60 years of age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mundane stuff (insurance, standard musical instruments, and transportation expenses) are all tabulated against the player's savings in the game.[3] The game also contains an anti-drug message for bands who decide to experiment in their usages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Biz (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
