			<description>The Faerie Dice series  evolved thematically from the board game  Faeries in which the Faeries, aided by Trolls, throw Cheese at each other while racing for safety. The Faerie Dice series of games use only dice-rolling; with players scoring over several rounds. Six is suggested as an ideal maximum number of players, though more could play, with rounds and games taking longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faerie Dice, the first of the series, comprises six unique dice each bearing three Faeries, two Trolls, and one Cheese, which can be used to play two games. The first, Faerie Dice, is a jeopardy game where players choose to collect Faeries, Trolls or Cheese, each scoring differently. Players may continue to roll so long as they continue to score but must be aware of the danger of wiping out their original score or even ending up with a negative score. The second game, The Cheese Cupboard, has players attempting to collect, over four rolls, specific scoring combinations of dice, called for example Bring on the Cheese, Grumpy Trolls, A Light Lunch or the eponymous Cheese Cupboard. As with the first game, scores are totalled over several rounds, with the winner the highest scorer after either a fixed number of rounds or after a set score has been reached by at least one player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
