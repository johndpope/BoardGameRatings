			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corporation Inc is both a business simulation and an office simulation, inspired by OPeNBooK's SimTower (North American name). With a small bankroll, depending on difficulty level, the player founds a corporation dedicated to pushing buttons. The button-pushers, who earn the money, are assisted by IT, Janitors, Accountants, Human Resources, researchers, and supervisors, who motivate them by beating them with sticks. The researchers can increase the productivity of all the kinds of workers, invent new ways of improving productivity, and increase the size limits of the office building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corporation Inc is cartoon styled, with a little bit of a Dilbert feel. The game has a built in, always-on tutorial with money rewards for completing objectives. The challenge in multiple plays is to discover exactly how the different jobs and aspects of the game relate to each other, and so how to win as quickly as possible. Cheat codes are available to allow play in a sandbox manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
