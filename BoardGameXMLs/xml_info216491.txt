			<description>Friday the 13th: The Game is a 2017 online multiplayer horror game set in world of the Friday the 13th movie franchise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is semi-cooperative, with up to 7 players taking on the role of camp Counselors trying to escape the wrath of iconic movie slasher Jason Voorhees whilst the remaining player takes the role of Jason himself who must attempt to murder them all before they escape from the Campsite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay includes survival horror tropes as Counselors must search the Campsite for items to aid them escape and help keep them alive such as weapons and healing items. Each game lasts just 20 minutes in which the Counselors need to escape from Jason through via getting a car or boat working (by refueling and repairing them), summoning the Police (via repairing the phones and calling them), or simply hide and survive for the 20 minute duration. It is also possible to kill Jason, although this is exceedingly difficult!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Jason Voorhees your mission is to kill as many Counselors as possible before the time elapses or they all escape off the Campsite. Jason has several powers that allow him to perform horror movie monster style feats such as teleport, fast move, sense the locations and movements of victims and turn off his background music allowing him to effectively sneak up on and jump scare people! He can smash up windows and fuse boxes to cause problems for the Counselors and elicit fear which makes Counselors temporarily loose their abilities and skills. He can also perform environmental kills based on location. There are several versions of Jason Voorhees to choose from, each with abilities and weaknesses inspired by their movie counterparts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can earn experience in game to buy new skills and abilities for both Jason and the Counselors, as well as unlock a wider choice of playable characters with custom clothing options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
