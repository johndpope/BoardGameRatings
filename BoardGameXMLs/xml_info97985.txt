			<description>A fantasy based game where you have to win quests using various characters (heroes and monsters), items (components, magical items, treasures and equipment) and spells. Special Event cards are used during gameplay to spice up the gaming experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players compete against each other and score points while completing quests.  Each player take their turn trying to match cards according to the current quests in play which vary during gameplay (as quests are completed).  Strategically players may play special Event cards to steal cards, force trading of cards, etc.  Each turn players pick two (2) cards from the draw pile and can at most play three (3) cards per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to have the most points before the maximum completed quest is reached which varies according to the number players:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    4 quests for 2 players (a rather quick game - appx. 15-20 mins.)&lt;br/&gt;    6 quests for 3 players (a longer game - appx. 30-40 mins.)&lt;br/&gt;    8 quests for 4 players (longest game - appx. 45-60 mins.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
