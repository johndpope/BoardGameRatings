			<description>Pawn Voyage is a race game where family and friends battle each other for their place in paradise.  Stranded and alone in a life raft, players must stay afloat while attempting to get all their pawns to paradise before anyone else does.  It won't be easy though, the other players will be doing all they can to Trade Places with you, Challenge you for your position or sending you flying across the board to a random location.  You will find extra help along the way with Additional Turns, Shortcuts and a Mega Roll to get you into paradise even quicker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
