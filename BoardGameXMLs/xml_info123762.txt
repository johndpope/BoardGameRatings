							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Army of the Barbarians</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains stats for both standard OGL play and Feast of Crows unit conversions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonus rules for heroes-as-units and fractional casualties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the walls of civilisation lie the untamed lands. Most of the world is untamed, wilderness, walked by fell beasts and savage races to whom fighting, survival is their only way of life. To survive out here, without the comforts of the hearth fire or the aid of trade and civilisation, to live requires you to become part beast yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The barbarian tribes survive by becoming the savage, by becoming the beast. Human ingenuity and flexibility combined with the very traits that make the lands so hard to live in, in the first place. They are one with the harsh land they inhabit be it plains, mountains, deserts or blasted wilderness. Supplementing their armies with wild horseflesh and the great beasts that civilisation looks upon in awe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And when stirred? These barbarians can be the greatest allies or the greatest enemies to civilised man. They can tear down his walls or unite with him against his enemies. They rebuff civilisation itself but to some the brotherhood of man overcomes any cultural difference that they might feel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blood is life, blood is sacrifice, blood is all. The barbarians embrace the beast and fight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
