			<description>As lobby and campaign spending soars to record highs, Congressional approval ratings plummet to all-time lows.  Explore the influence of money on Congress while playing this educational card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two kinds of cards in the Politics and Corruption deck: bill cards representing legislation of the 112th Congress, and capital cards that are used to solicit votes and champion bills.  Players take turns playing capital cards on bills until the draw pile is exhausted.  Bills pass with a simple majority, meaning more than half of the votes on a bill are in support.  Bills may either occupy the center of the table or be placed in front of a player who has chosen to champion them.  Championed bills earns their champion more points when passed, but costs that player a point when blocked.  Players also earn points by passing bills that are favored by their party, and by ending the game with lots of cards left in their hand.  The player with the most points at the end of a game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
