							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fifth Horseman</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virtually any person in the modern world knows about the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Famine, Pestilence, War, and Death; their story has become synonymous with destruction and doom. The iconic image of four riders bringing ruin to all those in their path has found striking cultural resonance with many groups, but no more so than among biker gangs. Seeing their motorcycles as &amp;ldquo;steel horses&amp;rdquo; and themselves as apocalyptic figures, harbingers of the imminent collapse of Western society, they have come to identify themselves with the unspoken &amp;ldquo;Fifth Horseman&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bikers find the ideal of the so-called &amp;ldquo;Fifth Horseman&amp;rdquo; appealing, in that it represents a rejection of normal morals and values in favor of a free and unchained lifestyle. They view their bikes as the ultimate symbol of freedom, allowing them to be in one city today, and hundreds of miles away the next, feeling the open air on their faces all the while. Some bikers become so attached to their rigs that man and machine start to blend at the edges. This new Advanced Class for the D20 Modern game allows you to mount up, and raise hell on two wheels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
