							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scum and Villainy: Criminals of the Star Lanes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proud aristocrats, brave mercenaries, dashing pilots and loyal stellar knights populate the galaxy's spacelanes. However, they are not alone. Beside the brave heroes with shining star-swords, other people ply the ocean of stars in search of profit and glory. Among these are the less savory of spacefarers. In the bowels of interstellar society, one may find them &amp;ndash; the scum of the galaxy: namely, lethal assassins and stealthy rogues. They might live in whatever wretched hive in the far colonies or in the stinking underbelly of a great arcology in the core. But regardless of their habitat, their stories are also stuff of legends, parallel to those of their more scrupulous brethren: stories of cunning heists, daring escapes, cleverly executed plans to bring down a tyrant &amp;ndash; and, indeed, outsmarting the Consortium and all other stuffed-shirt, dour-faced authority-figures who think they can tell the free-spirited scoundrel what he can and cannot do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This humble booklet offers the White Star player and referee two new classes. First is the Assassin &amp;ndash; a man (or woman!) trained in the art of precise killing and stealth. Second is the Rogue, a thief or spy skilled in getting into places people do not wish him to enter. Together with them, we present you with clarified and expanded stealth rules, two new ship modifications, five new weapons and two new pieces of gear. All together, we hope that this will open a secret door for you into the world of interstellar crime!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
