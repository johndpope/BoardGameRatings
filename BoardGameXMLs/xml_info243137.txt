							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Draft City</name>
									
			<description>Draft City is a drafting and tableau-building game for 3 to 5 players which focuses on combining card abilities to score prestige.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, players have five rounds (or four rounds in a five-player game) to harvest resources, issue commands, store goods and acquire buildings, contracts and workers from a deck of one hundred unique cards featuring different abilities. Each card can be used in several different ways, and there are many strategies to discover. Every card relates to one of five resources, and each resource has two separate themes represented by card abilities. Focusing exclusively on one resource provides the ability to play powerful buildings, while gathering multiple types of resource provides the ability to play a much greater variety of cards and combine their abilities in unexpected ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have what it takes to become the new mayor?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
