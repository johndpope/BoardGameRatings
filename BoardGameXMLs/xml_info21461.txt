							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big Mouth</name>
									
			<description>Big Mouth comes in quite a large box (15&amp;quot; x 16&amp;quot; x 3.5&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is given a large 14&amp;quot; red plastic fork and a paper plate on which there are 6 different plastic food items and a green bug.  A thin piece of cardboard is placed over a plastic bowl.  The cardboard is designed in the shape of a cute clown with a hole forming the entrance to his oral cavity, which is formed by the bowl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A spinner directs gameplay.  There are 7 equal segments on the spinner, representing each food object &amp;amp; the green bug.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a food object is spun, players race to be the first to feed it to the clown with their fork.  Losers replace their food object on their plate.  If a player has already successfully fed that particular food object to the clown on a previous turn they instead try to feed the clown the green bug.  If successful, opponents cannot feed the clown the food object that was spun on that turn and the bug is retrieved from the mouth of the clown &amp;amp; returned to its position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the green bug is spun, ANY food object may be placed in the clown's mouth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to feed all the food on their plate into the mouth of the clown is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
