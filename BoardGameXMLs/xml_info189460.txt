			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're ghostin' us, motherfucker. I don't care who you are back in the world, you give away our position one more time, I'll bleed ya, real quiet. Leave ya here. Got that?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A team of highly trained special forces badasses enter a hostile situation. Success in their mission is beyond doubt; they have the gear, the skills, the muscle and the one-liners to put an army into the ground without breaking a sweat. I saw one of them flex once and I almost died. Nothing on Earth could stand before them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or should I say, nothing from Earth...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One Ugly Motherfucker is a storygame that recreates the classic tale. The special forces team is wittled down, one by one, as they try to accomplish their mission. As each dies, they become an aspect of the Hunter and turn on their comrades. When only one is left, the tables are turned, and the Hunter becomes the Hunted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the storygame, One Ugly Motherfucker contains an expansion for PATROL called Run Through the Jungle, which pits the players against an alien menace. With an adjustable profile for the Hunter, including both unique strengths and weaknesses for varied play, and several new, overpowered items for human players to use against their attacker, this offers a whole new way to use the PATROL ruleset. A way that lets you carry and fire a minigun from the hip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
