			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superliga is a d20 pen and paper RPG system which is intended to encompass a variety of character concepts. The primary aim of Superliga is to provide players with a wide range of abilities for the personalisation of their characters, while allowing the Overseer the flexibility to create their own adventures. (Overseer is the word I use for &amp;ldquo;Dungeon Master&amp;rdquo; to distinguish it from D&amp;amp;D. I will probably revert to &amp;ldquo;DM&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;GM&amp;rdquo; because it&amp;rsquo;s easier to type in a hurry. &amp;ldquo;OS&amp;rdquo; may also become a popular term).&lt;br/&gt;The cosmology of Superliga is a mournful salute to every games master ever who&amp;rsquo;s described the setting of their campaign as a film noir only to be asked if the player can make a drow ranger. Superliga takes place in the twisted psyche of that particular player&amp;rsquo;s mind &amp;ndash;&lt;br/&gt;tiny splinters of the material plane float through some dark void where gigantic whales lurk. On some splinters, knights battle valiantly against dragons. On others, walking tanks fire missile salvos against psychic assassins. On the most numerous splinters, the same knights are bemusedly locked in combat with equally confused robots. All it takes to traverse from one splinter to the next is a little imagination, and of course a couple of skill points spent in the Planar school of magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
