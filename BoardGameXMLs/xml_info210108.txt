			<description>Constantinople (Istanbul) in the beginning of the 17th century at the Grand Bazaar (Kapali Carsi). Players are the proud owners of a few small textile shops with the ambition to build more and larger shops, sell more goods, gain customers' trust and popularity, in order to become the most successful merchant in Grand Bazaar. Players gain success points by satisfying their customer needs that are influenced by market demands. In order to expand, players need to hire more employees, build new shops and auxiliary buildings, increase their supplies, and attract more customers. Players need to make sure that they satisfy their customers; unsatisfied customers become angry, leave the shops and spoil players' reputation.&lt;br/&gt;During the game, players compete in preparing in the best possible way for running their market shops. Players send their managers and employees to external jobs (common for all players) in order to build new shops, order supplies, hire new employees etc.  Then they operate their shops in order to gain money for the next rounds and success points.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to gain the most success points.  Success points are gained by operating shops, having a large number of employees, operating a large market and by making presents to the Sultan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
