							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Odious Censor</name>
									
			<description>The object of Odious Censor is to get your team to guess a specific word or phrase. But there's a catch: you can't use certain &amp;quot;censored&amp;quot; words in your description. You have a minute to get through as many cards as possible, earning a point for each one your team guesses correctly. But use one of the censored words and you not only lose a point, you also get the DREADED COWBELL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you get your team to guess the word Pervert, without using the words Dirty, Gross, Filthy, or Sexual? Or maybe Fake ID without saying Underage, Liquor, Alcohol, or Bouncer. How would you describe a Walk of Shame without mentioning Next Morning, Last Night, Hookup, or Embarrassing?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It might sound easy, but only if you can handle the pressure of being timed and the looming threat of a censoring cowbell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Odious Censor comes with: 500 cards, 1 one-minute sand timer, 1 cowbell, 1 score pad, 1 pen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
