			<description>Playing as one of six unique Squirrels your mission is to add eight acorns to your personal stockpile in the Big Tree so you won't be hungry in the winter months.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forage and fight other Squirrels for acorns as you avoid such dangerous things such as power lines, cars, and kids with BB guns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing space consists of nine location cards in a grid. The Big Tree is always placed in the middle with the other locations being placed at random. Then each card starts with a certain number of acorns noted on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives a stockpile card with scoring chip, a random squirrel card, and a pawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you can choose three actions from the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.) Forage for an acorn - (Roll d6 under forage)&lt;br/&gt;2.) Move one space orthogonally to a new location&lt;br/&gt;3.) Attempt to steal an acorn from another squirrel at the same location as you (Roll d6+skill - Highest wins)&lt;br/&gt;4.) Add an acorn to your stockpile. (Only at the Big Tree)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a player rolls a six that player draws an event card and follows the instructions on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you be the first Squirrel to stockpile eight acorns and be ready for winter?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
