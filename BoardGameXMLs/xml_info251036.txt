							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Animal Kingdom: African Edition</name>
									
			<description>Animal Kingdom is an educational, fun and challenging game, built for the whole family to enjoy. There are easy and intermediate questions, so every member will be able to participate and learn something new. Players can even get rich by building up their own game farm while learning about the bush. Animal Kingdom was developed to get families and friends to interact and to show everyone how wonderful African wildlife is and how important it is for us to preserve and nurture what we have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move along several intersecting tracks on a map of Africa, taking actions depending on which type of location they land on. Various actions spots allow player to answer trivia questions about African wildlife, gain or lose money (themed as various types of wildlife for their own game farm), or encounter unexpected events. The interior of Africa holds several off-road paths which are high risk roads that may lead to disaster or to riches. As players correctly answer certain questions, they earn pieces for their individual jigsaw puzzle. The first to complete his or her puzzle wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wildlife trivia includes not only traditional question formats, but also tracking cards (with pawprints and other spoor that must be identified) and picture cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
