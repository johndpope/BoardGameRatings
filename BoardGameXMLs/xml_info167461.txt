			<description>Zombie ApocalyOOPS takes place in a not-so-distant future, where scientists who have been researching immortality have accidentally created zombies instead.  Fortunately, the condition can be reversed, though there may be some residual side-effects.  In the meantime though... players must battle each other to survive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie ApocalyOOPS is a fast paced card game in which players switch between human and zombie in a free-for-all battle.  Each card is split in half and color coded.  Blue halves are playable by humans, green by zombies, and white by any race.  If a player chooses (or is forced) to change race, they must flip their hand to the corresponding color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also includes 22 Event cards, of which a random 10 are used each game.  This provides high replay value, and also a chaotic element similar to what one might expect in a real zombie apocalypse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
