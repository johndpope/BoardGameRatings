			<description>Number of players: 2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game: The object of pwn_Henge is to &amp;quot;capture&amp;quot; your opponent's disks by moving one of your pieces onto a space occupied by his or her piece(s).&lt;br/&gt;Getting Started&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment: Cards (trilithon cards removed)&lt;br/&gt;10 disks of a color for each player&lt;br/&gt;The game board&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must first randomly determine which player will go first as this is a turn based game. Players each draw a card from the deck. The card having the highest value determines which player goes first. If both players draw cards of the same value, the day card beats the night card.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of PWN-Henge is to remove all of your opponent&amp;rsquo;s pieces from the board by capturing them with your own and be the last man standing. To capture an opponent&amp;rsquo;s disk, you must one of your pieces to that space. There are two methods for doing this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may move their disks into adjacent spaces:&lt;br/&gt;This may be done even if the target space is unoccupied.&lt;br/&gt;This results in the defending player losing his or her piece(s.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player moves his or her disk onto a space with two or more disks, the &amp;ldquo;defending&amp;rdquo; player will lose all of those pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may draw a card:&lt;br/&gt;Players may move to the space indicated on the card.&lt;br/&gt;Players may move into occupied or unoccupied spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may also move a disk in the exact amount of spaces (in either direction) of the drawn card&amp;rsquo;s value.&lt;br/&gt;Players may only make one move per turn and may move any of their own pieces in that turn. If a player draws a card, he or she must play it or pass. Played cards go into a discard pile. If the deck runs out before gameplay has ended, players must re-shuffle the deck and place it face down in the middle of the board.&lt;br/&gt;Ending the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has removed his or her opponent's pieces from the board, the game ends and the last man standing is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
