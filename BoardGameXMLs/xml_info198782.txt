			<description>&amp;quot;SD Snatcher (Japanese: すーぱーでふぉるめ・スナッチャー Hepburn: Supa Defuorume Sunatchā?, Super Deform Snatcher) is a role-playing video game by Konami for the MSX2 computer platform released in 1990 exclusively in Japan. It is a spin-off of the original Snatcher, adapting the same storyline into a different genre. In contrast to the original game's realistic art style, SD Snatcher features a &amp;quot;super deformed&amp;quot; art style, depicting all of the game's characters with big heads and childlike proportions (only the game's ending deviates from this style and reverts to the original game's realistic style).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with most RPGs released at the time, the game consists of overhead exploration of areas and menu-driven turn-based battles. However, it discards random encounters and introduces a battle system which uses a first-person perspective that allows the player to aim at specific body parts of an enemy and disable certain characteristics. For example, shooting a robot's wheels or legs will render the robot immobile, making it less likely to avoid the player's gunfire, attacking its weapon will reduce its strength, or continuously attacking its weak point could lead to a potentially quicker victory. As with other RPGs, the player can upgrade their weapon and purchase auxiliary items that can be used in battle to make battles easier. The game also introduces an auto-battle feature, where Metal Gear Petit can take control of the battle. Each of the firearm weapons have different abilities and target ranges as well as limited ammunition that needs to be brought or found separately.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SD_Snatcher SD Snatcher]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
