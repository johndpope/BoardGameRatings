			<description>(from UGG's Website: P500 production)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is developed from the Collectible Card Game: Tank Commander: The Eastern Front Edition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Panzer Commander Afrika 1940/1941 is a two- (or multi-) player card game covering tactical combat in North Africa (Libya and Egypt) during 1940 and 1941. The game contains 220 cards that represent British, German and Italian forces.&lt;br/&gt;Each vehicle card represents just one tank, half-track, or truck; each infantry card represents one squad of infantry; and each anti-tank gun card represents one AT-gun and its crew. Moreover, there are cards representing typical terrain, equipment and special events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card depicts in full color either a single tank, an infantry squad, an antitank gun, typical terrain, equipment, and special events. &lt;br/&gt;A space on the battle board (your table top) represents roughly 500 by 500 meters and each shot equals five real shots. You will find that your playing time&lt;br/&gt;closely approximates the time it really took to fight these battles in World War II.&lt;br/&gt;PANZER COMMANDER AFRIKA 1940/1941 includes eight different scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introductory Scenario: Tank Action (Tutorial), Sidi Barrani, 1940&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operation Compass, 1940&lt;br/&gt;In December 1940 the British went over to the offensive and rapidly destroyed the Italian forces in Egypt and Libya.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build Your Own, 1940&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sidi Rezegh, 1941&lt;br/&gt;During &amp;quot;Operation Crusader&amp;quot; a wild armored clash took place at and near Sidi Rezegh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minefields!&lt;br/&gt;A German armored force has run into a British position&lt;br/&gt;Build Your Own, 1941&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free For All&lt;br/&gt;In this scenario anything is possible - it is not even checked if a unit was available only in 1940 or 1941...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the scenario is great fun because all cards are used. In addition, only a minimum of preparation time is needed.&lt;br/&gt;Panzer Commander Afrika uses the system of Tank Commander, The Eastern Front formerly published by Moments in History.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More details about Tank Commander see: Photo Album&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Panzer Commander Afrika is a complete, non collectible card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Features&lt;br/&gt;Designed by Uli Blennemann &lt;br/&gt;Series Designer John Desch and Uli Blennemann&lt;br/&gt;TIME SCALE 1940/1941 &lt;br/&gt;NUMBER OF PLAYERS  Two or more&lt;br/&gt;Age: 14+&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
