							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Geek Out! The Big Bang Theory</name>
									
			<description>Geek Out! is a party game that can determine once and for all which player is the most knowledgeable about your favorite pop culture subjects!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, you draw cards asking you to list a certain number of things which fall under a certain category: comic books, fantasy, games, science fiction, and miscellaneous. Before you begin, however, the other players may try to steal your points (and bragging rights!) by bidding to list even more than the card requires. The bidding continues until one player is ready to &amp;quot;out-geek&amp;quot; their friends. Collect a predetermined number of cards, and you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the other topics normally found in Geek Out! titles, Geek Out! The Big Bang Theory features questions about the Warner Bros. Television&amp;rsquo;s sitcom of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
