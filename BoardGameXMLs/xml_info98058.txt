							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nemesis: A Perfect World GM Screen</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first supplement to Nemesis: A Perfect World is designed to be the resource any Game Master needs to run the game effectively. The GM Screen is made of three standup folding panels. On the outside, for the players to look at, is a dynamic full color scene.  On the inside, for the Game Master&amp;rsquo;s use, are charts reporting everything from how combat and magic works to possible outcomes of a random hit. Also included with the GM screen is a booklet including a new adventure, an updated powers chart, and additional game errata. There is also a two-sided generic character sheet designed to photocopy for the players' use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
