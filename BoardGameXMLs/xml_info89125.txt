			<description>Strange cycling board game because during the race the cyclists also switch to air movement (via either a balloon, slow or fast air plane) and travel over water (via a rowing boat, 2 normal boats and a hovercraft) between the tracks. The cyclist who arrives first in the port can choose which boat he chooses and thus move faster over the water to the final cyclist track. So this is a race game over land, air &amp;amp; water. The player who reaches the finish in Chiromo Village wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the book The KnowHow Book of Action Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
