			<description>The stated object of the game is to &amp;quot;do everything you can to survive out-of-control government, corrupt unions and environmental weenies who want to destroy your business and livelihood.&amp;quot; The object of the game is to be the last player with at least one franchise, or to be the first player to complete four circuits of the board and roll &amp;quot;some snake eyes&amp;quot;; failure to roll two ones on two six sided dice on completing four circuits eliminates that player from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with many games of this genre, the focus is on political satire rather than game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
