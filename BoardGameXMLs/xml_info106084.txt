							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mutant Virus: Crisis in a Computer World</name>
									
			<description>The plot centers around protagonist, Ron, and his fight to eliminate a virus out of a global A.I. that is responsible for every aspect of technology in the game's present day. If Ron is unable to extinguish the virus, humanity will be thrown back to the Stone Age. The player controls a miniature &amp;quot;space ship&amp;quot; that shoots anti-virus and other variations of the weapon to try to contain the virus in that room.&lt;br/&gt;The virus in the game is a cellular automaton following the rules of Conway's Game of Life, with the exception that each cell is either a virus cell (green) or a clean cell (light blue). As new cells are created, they either be virus cells or clean cells depending on which type makes up the majority of their neighbors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Mutant Virus: Crisis in a Computer World&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
