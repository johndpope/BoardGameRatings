			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you track down Dimitrius, the human time bomb?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a crack operator for the Special Security Agency. Now the agency is counting on you to find the deadly Dimitrius, a human time bomb who can explode with all the force of an atomic blast! But before you start your search, you'll need an undercover identity. What should you be?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you decide to pose as a professional gambler, turn to page 74. If you pretend to be an art collector, turn to page 23. Think carefully! Dimitrius is dangerous. He might shatter you into a thousand fiery pieces--unless you can outsmart him and save the world from disaster!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What happens next in the story? It all depends on the choice you make. How does the story end? Only you can find out! And the best part is that you can keep reading and rereading until you've had not one but many incredibly daring experiences!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
