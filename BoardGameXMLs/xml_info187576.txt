							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The World of Sylnae</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last campaigns took place in Sylnae around 1659, but much has changed and today, one would hardly recognize the places they used to be familiar with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The old calendar was dropped years ago, shortly after the chaos began. A new calendar was started and today the year is 533, no one is exactly sure how many years passed before the new calendar was adopted but historians theorize that around one thousand years passed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World of Sylnae is the campaign setting developed for the s3 Version 1.0 rules.  It has not been updated for s3 Version 1.1 update.  The setting is presented as a series of HTML pages (homepage, geography, theology, people, lexicon, and organizations).  Several maps are provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
