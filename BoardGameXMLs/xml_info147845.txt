			<description>From the game text&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Human beings had gone away.&lt;br/&gt;Either consumed by death or transcended to a higher state, they left their world.&lt;br/&gt;But Earth wasn&amp;rsquo;t empty nor asleep. Out of a seeming lack of sentience, civilization has risen. Remembrance of the Ones Before became mystery and myth. The world was inherited, nurtured and called home. A new history began.&lt;br/&gt;That was until we felt fire in the air, the sky glowing ablaze.&lt;br/&gt;Something is changing. A human has come back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;inabsentia is a roleplaying game about humanity in a world totally changed. Its aim is to get players to live together a story full of sense of wonder, alienness and dramatic comparisons between what&amp;rsquo;s human and what is not. To play you will need to be three or four people with some dice, pen, paper and markers. A stereo loaded with awe and wonder-inducing music (see later) can be a great optional.&lt;br/&gt;Years (or centuries, or epochs) have passed since humanity left the Earth, and a new sentient species, or more than one, inherited the whole world. We will play together to see what happens when a human being resurfaces, and i twill not be painless at all. This Human will be the past coming back, whether to haunt Earth or to change it for the better, and a single hurricane capable of tremendous change. What will be destroyed, what will change, and whether the return will be a short world-changing event or something taking roots, we will see during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
