							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Side of Loridian</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Barrington Tor is (or rather was) a corporate transport ship used by Nebula Vista Corporation to ferry high value cargo and representatives across the frontier. When the ship went missing two weeks ago it made interstellar news.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last week a satellite located its remains on the dark side of Loridian (in the Kassel System), and an expensive search was undertaken by local rescuers who failed to find survivors using remote recon drones. Today NVC ordered the search ended and sadly sent news to the families of the eight beings lost in that crash, citing failure in the nav computer as the likely root cause of the accident, killing all aboard. Reparation to families is underway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your team has been sent to recover the black box flight data recorder from the wreckage. The dark side of Loridian is a dangerous place, made even more dangerous when the team realizes the ship was sabotaged, and they&amp;rsquo;re not alone among the wreckage of the Barrington Tor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
