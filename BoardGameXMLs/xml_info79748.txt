							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scott Pilgrim vs. the World: The Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World: The Game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up game based on the comic book series Scott Pilgrim by Bryan Lee O'Malley, and tying in with the release of the film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. It is published by Ubisoft and developed by Ubisoft Montreal with Ubisoft Chengdu. The game was first announced at Comic Con 2009 in July 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loosely following the plot of the graphic novels, up to four players can play as Scott Pilgrim, Ramona Flowers, Kim Pine or Stephen Stills (along with two other unlockable characters), who must battle through seven levels in order to defeat Ramona's seven evil exes. Characters have their own individual movesets, which can be expanded upon by gaining enough experience, and are also able to use weapons and summon Knives Chau to assist them. During co-operative play, certain actions can be performed such as simultaneously taunting to defeat enemies or reviving fallen comrades before they lose a life. Defeating enemies earns coins (stylized Canadian currency) which can be spent on health items or attribute boosts. Players can also enter Subspace areas which act as bonus areas where extra coins can be earned. Other modes include a boss rush mode, and a zombie survival mode unlocked via a cheat code.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World: The Game , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
