With numerous coins representing larger amounts including limited edition collectors coins its easy to replicate even larger amounts of loot such as a Dragons hoard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters reward your players with cold hard gold after an epic battle or the plundering of a long lost tomb. Players equip yourself with a belt pouch and guard your precious coin.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
