			<description>Hidden Intruder is a reprint/re-skin of Intruder: a one player board game that re-creates the theme and feel of the movie &amp;quot;Alien&amp;quot;. The game can also be played with 1-3 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to survive an encounter with an alien &amp;quot;intruder&amp;quot; on a space ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the Print &amp;amp; Play website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Intruder is an alien being of unknown power. During the course of the game the Intruder will move through the space station as both the hunter and the hunted. One or more players must cope with a monster that moves rapidly and changes continuously as it undergoes metamorphosis into a more powerful being, and possibly divides into two or more clones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hidden Intruder is a solitaire game &amp;ndash; BUT it has 3 &amp;ldquo;scenarios&amp;rdquo; or different ways to play that allow for 2-3 players to play.&lt;br/&gt;-Intelligent Intruder (One player plays the Intruder)&lt;br/&gt;-Return to Prometheus (One player plays the Intruder, or 3 players each take a team of 3 troops)&lt;br/&gt;-Science Officers (2 players, each control a separate team, with slightly different win conditions, allowing for one player or both players or neither player to win)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 54 counters representing the crew and their weapons, lab animals (which confuse the search) and the Intruder. The playing map shows in detail the interior of deep space station &amp;lsquo;Prometheus&amp;rsquo;. The map also contains special charts to record the development of the Intruder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hidden Intruder is an exciting game of terror and suspense for one to two players. Hidden Intruder is a reskin of the old Classic game, Intruder. Dennis Sustare, designer of Intruder, has agreed to let me reprint his game with this new art.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
