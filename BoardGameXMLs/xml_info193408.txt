			<description>Optimatics flagship optimisation software, Optimizer, is a powerful tool to help engineers optimally design their water systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Optimatics: The Card Game players compete to put together the most interesting Optimizer project by collecting hydraulic models, decisions, criteria, objectives and cloud computing subscriptions. Try to be quick to collate a project first or push your luck to get a project worth more points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt 7 cards each. On a player's turn they draw a card from the deck or discard pile and discard a card. Players must form a complete hand to win (1 model card, 1 subscription card, 1+ decision cards, 1+ criteria cards, 1+ objective cards). But it's not just who finishes first wins. When one player reveals a complete hand. Everyone else with a complete hand adds up their score. Scoring varies depending on the specific cards of each type a player has. Most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
