							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Savage Thunderscape: The World of Aden</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Epic World of Steam and Darkness&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Aden, a thousand-year Golden Age of prosperity gave rise to an unprecedented development: the fusion of magic and technology into a unique discipline called mechamagic. Arcane power, steam power, and gunpowder changed the world almost overnight. The Golden Age ended, and the Age of Thunder began. It seemed that there would be no limit to the industry and ingenuity of man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Until the Darkfall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A supernatural cataclysm of unknown origin, the Darkfall plunged the world into darkness as the sun was blotted out for only a moment. In that moment, every nightmare and horror imagined by the people of Aden sprang into existence, and the world was thrown into chaos. Villages were wiped from the face of the world, entire cities burned, and tens of thousands perished in an instant. It seemed that the world would die in flames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Aden will not die so easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, ten years later, the people of Aden struggle to survive in the face of unrelenting assault by horrors beyond imagining. It is a world of magic, a world of industry, a world of horror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the World of Aden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Savage Thunderscape: the World of ADen is a setting and mechanics sourcebook compatibly with the Savage Worlds role-playing game. Within the pages of this book you will find the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Details on the different races of Aden, seven of which are new to this work!&lt;br/&gt;    New Edges of all types, including new Arcane Backgrounds!&lt;br/&gt;    New spells, new technology, and new equipment!&lt;br/&gt;    A sample bestiary of creatures from Aden!&lt;br/&gt;    And much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
