							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scorpions&#039; Cove</name>
									
			<description>In Scorpions&amp;rsquo; Cove, you play pirates who stumble upon an island laden with gold - and, as the name would suggest, overrun with scorpions. The last crew to stop here didn&amp;rsquo;t make it off the island, and their treasure is just lying out in the open for the taking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luckily, you have a good apothecary on board, and he&amp;rsquo;s able to compound an antidote for you. of course, like any good pirate apothecary, he&amp;rsquo;ll give you one for free to get you started, but the rest are going to cost you. So, off you head to Scorpion&amp;rsquo;s Cove to seek your treasure. The bold will get more gold - but they&amp;rsquo;ll also get stung more. The cautious may not be injured, but they won&amp;rsquo;t make nearly as much. Choose wisely...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each player's turn, he or she may draw any number of cards from the deck. If a player encounters three or more scorpion cards, he'll be stung - and without Antidote cards to cover the stings, he'll have to be carried back to the ship by his crewmates, who'll take all of his treasure while he's unconscious. The player with the most treasure at the end of the game wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
