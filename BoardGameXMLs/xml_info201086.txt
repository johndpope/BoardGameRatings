							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elementor</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Dylan Duvall is attacked by a mystic order, he found himself endowed with mastery over the elements! With his ability to transmute his body into any substance he comes into contact with and capable of generating and controlling the four basic alchemical elements, he concluded that fate had chosen him to oppose evil and prevent villains like those who attacked him from gaining such power. As the powerhouse hero, ELEMENTOR, he does just that. There's no place on the earth, in the sea, nor air where ELEMENTOR isn't a great force for justice!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
