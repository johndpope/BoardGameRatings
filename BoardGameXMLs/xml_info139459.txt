			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supernatural suspense, horror, and action await the unwary in Shadowglade! 500 years ago, the world ended. More than that, it was forgotten, the minds of those alive scoured clean of knowledge, history, and identity. In the intervening years, society has rebuilt as best it could, new alliances have been forged and blood-sworn enemies made as the surviving nations have begun to rediscover their roots. Out in the wilds and darkness, however, not all that lurks is friendly...or human...or even alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The history of Shadowglade is one shrouded in mystery and uncertainty. The ruling nations and popular churches and inquisitive souls have documented what little history they could, however, in an attempt to ensure the ravages of time could not scour what little they knew ever again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our historical world had a great deal of difficulty in these times but the folks of that era survived without magic, without scads of adventurers to flood local coffers with cash. Shadowglade seeks to emulate that world more than one of traditional sword and sorcery; to help Game Masters exploring this realm we have composed Hearth &amp;amp; Home, a collection and expansion of OGL and original material to assist in world building. Culled from several sources, both gaming and historical, and tweaked for a Shadowglade flavor this guide includes a number of helpful charts, tables, and topics to build your own settlements for Shadowglade or any other fantasy realm!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Tables! Lots of tables, new and reproduced for easy access, to determine distances, populations, acreage, buildings, residences, and more!&lt;br/&gt;     Trust! An excellent subsystem to recreate the uneasy little town atmosphere, expanded to include specific forms of trust, variations how to set and manage trust in a community, and more!&lt;br/&gt;     Qualities &amp;amp; Traits! Additional settlement qualities and character traits to further tweak and hook your characters to the small town mentality.&lt;br/&gt;     Old Nobside settlement; stat block, history, and some roleplaying notes for a community constructed with these very rules!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This guide is intended for game masters only! Part of the suspense of Shadowglade lies in mystery, misdirection, and exploration; if you are almost exclusively a player or intended on playing in the campaign setting before running, its a good idea to leave this book be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
