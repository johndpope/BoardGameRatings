			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RPCheese is a tabletop roleplaying game that takes place in a fictional, alternate future where mankind is no more and intelligent rodents roam and rule the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A World of Hamsters and Bottle Rockets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the not-so-far-flung future world of RPCheese, Earth&amp;rsquo;s intelligent rodent population has constructed a society of their own resembling something of a cross between a Midwestern pet store, a post-apocalyptic demilitarized zone, a Renaissance faire, and Sean Connery&amp;rsquo;s bathroom. Or, at least, a few of those things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this world, scattered towns and kingdoms built from the remains of human cities dot the Earth. Rodent-sized buildings are erected from cardboard boxes, buckets, hamster cages, and other disparate ruins left behind by a vanished human society. These settlements&amp;rsquo; furry inhabitants spend their time trading, foraging for food, and fighting for survival against lizards, cats, and other savage beasts not blessed with human-like intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RPCheese uses an easy to learn d20 based system, with skills, feats, and all of the things you are used to if you have ever played the worlds oldest RPG! Only here the races are MUCH more interesting...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Choose from Hamsters, Gerbils, Guinea Pigs, Mice, Rats, Chipmunks, Squirrels, and Rabbits as your player characters!&lt;br/&gt;    Use far-flung future trash such as thimbles, sewing needles, and bottle rockets as your weapons!&lt;br/&gt;    Fight lizards, spiders, birds and other survivors for food, resources, and CHEESE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
