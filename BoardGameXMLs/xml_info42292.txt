			<description>Easy game of moving the pawn from field number one up to field number twelve and back again. On his turn the player rolls three dice and is allowed to move along all fields for which the sum of two or three dice equals the field number. No fields may be skipped. The first player to be back is the winner (how you can reach field number one with two dice will remain a mystery).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game offers some variants to spice things up. One is to allow subtraction, division and multiplying in addition to adding but all three dice are mandatory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
