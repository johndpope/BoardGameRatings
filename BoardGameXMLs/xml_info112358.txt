			<description>Players take the role of MATRIX RUNNERS (2-4 players) characters with unique advantages, disadvantages &amp;amp; specialty RIGS which they use to hack into the Cybernet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take missions, complete them, hack into systems, enter battle arenas, invest in upgrading, or purchasing programs, and taking on more &amp;amp; more difficult challenges, all the while dodging traces, system guardians, &amp;amp; other players who may be trying to collect a bounty on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's always risky engaging with other players in the net.&lt;br/&gt;this provides them with the ability to trade or sell each other programs, or reveal information (for a price). But you never know if the mission they're on is to catch you &amp;amp; destroy you.&lt;br/&gt;if you get caught, you can get fined, you programs can become corrupted, or you could face a serious virus is infecting your rig, or worse, eliminated!&lt;br/&gt;It is a game of covert operations, espionage, and power. The more you earn the better the hardware &amp;amp; software you can buy, and become better equipped to move on to bigger and better things, but you never know who could be after you &amp;amp; who can be your ally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Year is 2055&lt;br/&gt;The world is run by 3 major corporations,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GLOBE-E-TRON, E-Vision, and NOVA CORPS.&lt;br/&gt;Sovereignty of Countries, and Governments have become obsolete.&lt;br/&gt;The once known Internet has evolved into a vast Virtual Cybernet, where millions of people live out their&lt;br/&gt;fantasy in virtual entertainment. The WORLD has become solely dependent on this Cybernet.&lt;br/&gt;Corporations that virtually govern the world have reputation to uphold, &lt;br/&gt;so they hire MATRIX RUNNERS to do their dirty work.&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes these RUNS, include:&lt;br/&gt;Hacking Important information on a new product, &lt;br/&gt;Retrieve info on corporate activity, &lt;br/&gt;Eliminate the competition by destroying their system. &lt;br/&gt;Other jobs include hunting down other hackers as well,&lt;br/&gt;Because of this vast underground employment market, a secret organization has developed an agency to facilitate &lt;br/&gt;these jobs, keeping both the employer, and runner safe and anonymous.&lt;br/&gt;This AGENCY also provides illegal programs to registered RUNNERS &amp;amp; provides them with jobs.&lt;br/&gt;They are simply referred to as THE AGENCY.&lt;br/&gt;It is a dangerous world of Intrigue, Deception, Skill, and Subterfuge. Noone is truly safe, and anyone can be traced and Eliminated. Tread carefully, young Runner...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
