							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Postman Pat: Package of Fun</name>
									
			<description>From cover&lt;br/&gt;There's lot of fun to be had with Postman Pat, Jess his black and white cat and the other colourful characters who live in Greendale. Postman Pat&amp;trade; Package of Fun is designed to help children develop easy learning skills whilst having fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Remember the moves that your favourite Postman Pat&amp;trade; characters make on the screen and repeat them in the Memory Game. The better you do the more actions you will have to remember!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     In the Pairs Game match either the characters, their hats and faces, or their dance moves - the harder the level the more cards you have to match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Help Mrs Goggins change the pattern and colour of parcels to match the others on the rack in the Parcel Game. Try to bring a smile to her face by matching up all the parcels correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Feed, water and play with Postman Pat's cat Jess for the day in the Looking after Jess Game. Remember she needs lots of attention. Keep an eye on all the indicators and the clock to make sure you don't miss anything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
