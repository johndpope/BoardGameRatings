			<description>La Qu&amp;ecirc;te des Chevaliers (Knights' Quest) is a boardgame that is primarily a memory mechanic game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two players face each other, both players must remember the location of the Excalibur swords and dragons laid about the board. Then they close their eyes, moving their finger on the plateau to reach the castle of their opponent without touching a dragon. And when they find Excalibur, they win gold coins. Players must therefore memorize the course and stay well focused. The winner is the player who wins the most coins by reaching the other's castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
