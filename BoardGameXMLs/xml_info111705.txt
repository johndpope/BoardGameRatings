			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Neverwhen campaign setting lets you go anywhere and play any type of character you have ever dreamed of. It is simple enough for a new player, but also has a lot for a veteran player to enjoy. If you have never played a tabletop role-playing game before you will love playing Neverwhen. Your characters are only limited by the extent of your imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have been playing for a long time, Neverwhen gives you new classes, races, and feats to enrich your gaming experience. The Wound system in Neverwhen gives the character a more &amp;ldquo;life like&amp;rdquo; feel, and with the Edges and Hindrances, you can give your character any kind of personality you want, from a fun loving trouble maker to a serious veteran fighter, to anything in between.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For gamemasters, Neverwhen will allow you to add new elements to your campaign. These new elements range from psionics to mutations, from cybernetics to new magic abilities. Add in a new level of breadth and dimension that will really excite your players. Have your players ever wondered what a tank can really do in a fantasy campaign? Have you ever wondered how a druid would react in our modern day city? Ever thought what would happen if you turned off all the power in the world today and how would your players survive? Well now you can do just that and have everything you need to bring those new stories to life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go wherever your imagination takes you. Use the gates located in the amazing city of Manzala to travel to any worlds with any combination of genres that you can imagine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the Neverwhen books are:&lt;br/&gt;-Exciting new classes such as the stoic tribal warrior or the battle hardened soldier.&lt;br/&gt;-Complete rules for playing interesting new races like the dragon-like hylathans, hearty techno organic construct and adventurous xenoforms (anthropomorphic animals)&lt;br/&gt;-Dozens of new prestige classes. Ranging from the heroic ork swashbuckler to highly skilled arcane gunmen.&lt;br/&gt;-Enhanced combat system that includes rules for automatic weapons, explosives and vehicular combat.&lt;br/&gt;-New and revised spells for the new classes Techno-Mage and Trans-Dimensional Magi.&lt;br/&gt;-New and revised creatures that travel through the realms.&lt;br/&gt;-&amp;hellip; and much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
