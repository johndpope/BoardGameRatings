			<description>from the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Fight for Loyalty&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loyalty is overrated.  Sure, you can swear allegiance to a nation or a state, but when the going gets tough, are they really going to remember you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Fight for Glory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yeah, you think you&amp;rsquo;re hot stuff because you&amp;rsquo;ve got a killer mecha.  You probably think you can take the galaxy on all by yourself, but let&amp;rsquo;s get real.  You&amp;rsquo;ve been watching too many bad action movies.  One pilot and one mecha can&amp;rsquo;t change the world, but you know what you can do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight for Money!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of Mecha Mercenaries where the mecha pilots, be they the vilest evil or the purest of heart, all fight for one thing: money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mecha Mercenaries is an expansion for the Mecha role playing system.

The Crimson Emperor is dead and the nobles he left behind are hiring every able body the can find to fight their wars for them.  That&amp;rsquo;s where you come in.  Live long enough and you&amp;rsquo;ll get rich.

Lots of places in this galaxy need a few steady warriors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metal and Flesh, Fight for Cash, Together as One!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The universe is at war mecha pilot.
