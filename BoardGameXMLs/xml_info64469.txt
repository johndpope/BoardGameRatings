			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ah, summer. A time for BBQ's, swimming pools, parties and relaxation on the weekend. Camping trips and visits to State and Federal Parks are a standard for many citizens of the United States, a chance to spend some quality time with the family, get away from the city, and leave work behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Memorial Day and the Fourth of July are two of the busiest times for parks and recreational areas. Hundreds of people are usually in attendance, and the larger parks see thousands of people. Even small, local State parks can easily have several hundred people pass through the gates on a daily basis. These groups often stay at the small campgrounds scattered throughout the woods, but many more people go to these parks for the hiking, the sights, or to enjoy a river or lake if they are available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parks are usually full of campers, children running and squealing, swimmers, and couples in love spending precious time together. Togetherness, food and family are a common theme to those who go to a park during the holidays, and several hundred people have come to Applegate State Park to enjoy the weather and the lake, some camping, some hiking, some swimming, and some being brought to see the historical sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This holiday, however, is New Year's Day, and nothing will ever be the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Independence Day Massacre is the first Year of the Zombie adventure, set at the time of the rising, and sets upto 8 PC's (with pregenerated characters) in the unenviable situation of being trapped in the middle of a zombie infested National Park, their mission, to get out and survive. Poorly equipped, outnumbered twenty five to one, the odds are stacked against them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Year of the Zombie is recommended for Mature Audiences only, due to horror, brutality and profanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 35 page adventure pdf, including pregenerated characters, additional 'meat'.. er NPC's and a selection of zombie's&lt;br/&gt;A 54 page full colour battlemap document, providing 25mm scale tiles for all the major encounter areas.&lt;br/&gt;Vehicle stats for a typical Park Services Jeep.&lt;br/&gt;New random zombie appearance tables, to make each zombie uniquely grusome.&lt;br/&gt;8 Pregenerated Character Sheets&lt;br/&gt;Player handout map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requires The Year of the Zombie sourcebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
