			<description>From the cover -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When that last adventure went a bit wrong and you had what is referred to as a Near Death Experience, something changed. If you had any doubts that there was life after death, those doubts have been erased, because when you were brought back to life, you gained a new and constant companion--a ghost who has decided to form a partnership with you. It's a little bit like having an invisible friend who can actually help you out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by films like The Frighteners and the classic British television series Randall and Hopkirk (deceased), Modern Advances: Spookmaster provides a new, slightly askew take on ghosts for Modern OGL games. Designed by Steve Miller, this release features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spookmaster advanced class.&lt;br/&gt;Three new feats, including Ghost Companion.&lt;br/&gt;The first of IDA's Terror Templates, which will rework classic creatures in ways that fit better with modern and futuristic settings.&lt;br/&gt;Also compatible with IDA's Mind Over Matter skill-based psionics system.&lt;br/&gt;A fully detailed NPC -- celebrity Spookmaster Marion K. Bassett.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes a creature template that updates ghosts for modern and futuristic campaign settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
