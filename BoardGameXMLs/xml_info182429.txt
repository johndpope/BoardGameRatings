			<description>In this comic book-themed game, the world&amp;rsquo;s most nefarious and diabolical super-villain has been captured and imprisoned by meddling heroes. As fellow villains and loyal henchmen, it's up to you to orchestrate an escape!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a (mostly) cooperative board/card game for 1-4 players, in which you acquire super powers, battle heroes, and overcome obstacles to break the super-villain out of a maximum-security prison.  The game includes four (4) different prisons, with their own set-up rules, victory conditions, and defeat conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to accomplish their goals, players draw a hand of 5 cards from the communal &amp;quot;Villain&amp;quot; deck.  These cards include Attack cards, Defense cards, and Power Surge cards.  Attack cards are played on heroes, guards, and obstacles in order to defeat them.  Defense cards are played to overcome certain obstacles, as well as protect players' hands from the hero &amp;amp; guard abilities that otherwise make them discard cards and reduce players' effectiveness on their turns.  Power Surge cards are used to overcome certain obstacles, but more importantly are used to purchase super-powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can acquire different combinations of abilities, choosing from among 22 unique super powers.  These powers run the range of classic powers, including Super Strength, Time Control, Energy Blasts, and others.  Powers allow players to break or augment the normal rules of play, making their hand of cards go further and hit harder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the players defeat heroes and guards, they acquire victory points.  If the players succeed in defeating the scenario, the player with the most victory points gets bragging rights as the &amp;quot;winner&amp;quot;.  If the game wins, then all the players lose regardless of points, so teamwork is essential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
