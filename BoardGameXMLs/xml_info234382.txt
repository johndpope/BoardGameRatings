			<description>The race is divided into four leg. Two Types of tests are possible: Time Controls (CH) or Special Stages (SS).&lt;br/&gt;Each tests has a pre-fixed number of turns to be executed. But work differently: CH rewards regularity. SS rewards speed. &lt;br/&gt;The movement of cars is made by token 1-6 numbered. Each leg distributes a predefined number of token. &lt;br/&gt;The board is divided in cases, where only one car can stand in each case. It's a wide two lanes with narrow points to one lane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wins who in the end counts less penalties, in the number of turns set on the itinerary cards, separately for each CH and each SS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In CH, you receive one minute of penalty for each missing case on arrival, or two minutes for each case over the arrival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In SS, instead, you add +1 minutes at base time (predefined) for each missing case on arrival, or -1 minutes at base time for each case over the arrival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
