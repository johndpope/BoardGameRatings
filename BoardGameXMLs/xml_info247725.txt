							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wrath of Kings: Izari Warhounds</name>
									
			<description>It would seem that dogs would be quite out of place amongst the technomantic and steam-fueled horrors commonplace on the battlefields of Arikania, but through long research and dedicated training, the armies of House Nasier do just that. Some of the war masks of the Nasier allow for limited yet powerful telepathic communication, and it is through these masks that the masters are able to bond with the hounds and help them through the binding with their elemental masks, creating a wonderful blend of intelligence, stability, superior senses, and predatory ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wrath of Kings: Izari Warhounds includes two characters and bases and a unit card for use with the base game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
