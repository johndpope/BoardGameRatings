							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Male Luchador Names</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lucha libre is a professional wrestling game that originated in Mexico. Its competitors, or luchadores, are known for the highly decorative masks that many of them wear, often with their true identities hidden by both the masks and their names.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a list of 100 different male names, or perhaps titles, inspired by the sport of lucha libre. They are in Spanish with English translations. These names could be used for professional wrestlers in a wrestling RPG, and some are more suitable for the &amp;quot;rudos&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;bad guys&amp;quot; of Mexican wrestling. The names could even used for superheroes and supervillains in another type of game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;41. Esp&amp;iacute;ritu de M&amp;eacute;xico - Spirit of Mexico&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
