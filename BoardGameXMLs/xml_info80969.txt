			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blitzkrieg at the Ardennes is a turn-based, operational level wargame on the Battle of the Bulge during World War II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map utilizes a hexagonal grid with three zoom levels.  Terrain types include plains, mountains, forests, cities and Siegfried Lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units have combat and movement factors in the manner of board wargames.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the normal unit types of armor, infantry, artillery and so forth, there are also V-2 rocket units and German infiltrators, with the latter having the ability to misdirect the movement of Allied units nearby, albeit at the risk of being discovered and destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was sold in a small folder containing a printed manual and game disk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
