			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book catalogues some of the most famous and infamous creatures of Magnamund and presents them in an easy to use format for the Lone Wolf Adventure Game system. Additionally, it provides evocative descriptions, histories, combat traits, and special rules relevant to each. From a loathsome Vazhag to a hideous Gourgaz, great care has been taken to make sure that the men and monsters represented here are accurate profiles of the ones that first appeared in Joe Dever&amp;rsquo;s original gamebook series, replete with lots of extra information that will enhance your understanding and enjoyment of his unique creations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book serves as a springboard for Narrators and Players alike, with an special chapter devoted to the art of bringing these monsters alive, so that each encounter will have something to savour and be remembered for everyone involved. This book also introduces some powerful new adversaries, such as the Agarashi and many extra-planar creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as being a fascinating read in its own right, this book provides the ultimate toolkit for the Narrator who needs to pull together an encounter scenario quickly, but is understandably reluctant to compromise on quality for the sake of expedience. The best and the worst of the wonderful world of Magnamund await you. Turn the page&amp;hellip; if you dare!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
