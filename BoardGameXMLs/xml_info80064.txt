							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prison Tycoon</name>
									
			<description>Private prisons have become the new growth industry. You will construct and run an efficient rehabilitation facility with nothing but money on your mind. There's no escaping under your watchful eye as you oversee every detail of prison life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brick by Brick...&lt;br/&gt;Start from the ground up placing the very walls and fences that will house and contain your prisoners. Choose from multiple isolated environments and get to work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pay the Cost to be the Boss...&lt;br/&gt;Begin with a low security prison and build it up to a maximum security facility for the world's most dangerous criminals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What We Have Here is a Failure to Communicate...&lt;br/&gt;Expertly staff your prison with wardens, guards, cooks and rehabilitation experts. Carefully balance your budget, maintain prisoner morale and minimize the potential for financial meltdown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron Hand or Velvet Fist...&lt;br/&gt;Determine the overall security level of your lockdown, but beware! Too harsh a prison will create a dangerous environment and could spark prisoner riots. Too lenient an approach will result in rampant gang activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
