			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s something rotten in the town of Advent&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advent - the last civilised place in The Realm before one crosses into the barbarian lands of The Long Riding.  Many years ago this was a lawless place of warring clans and murderous bandits. Advent has grown since then, but little has changed. It still attracts the dregs, the runaways, the refugees, the desperate, the unforgiven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps this is why Zarand and his gang of robbers thought Advent was a good place to lie-low. To plan the next job. To find the fabled treasure hoard of the barbarian chief, Hessaret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But naturally, nothing is ever so simple.&lt;br/&gt;This might just be Zarand&amp;rsquo;s last job...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hessaret&amp;rsquo;s Treasure is a RuneQuest 6th Edition scenario set in The Realm, the lands described in Book of Quests.  It provides a side chapter for that campaign or, as is intended, a scenario in its own right. While useful, Book of Quests is not essential to play, and this scenario can be easily slotted into many fantasy campaign settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
