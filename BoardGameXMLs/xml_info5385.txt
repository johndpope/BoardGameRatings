			<description>Speculation is a commodity-trading game for 2 to 4 players, Ages 12 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to finish with the most money.  The players start with a portfolio of blue chips, gold, oil, and treasury bonds worth $1,000,000.  Players can buy and sell shares by landing on Market Mover spaces on the gameboard.  Every time someone lands on a Market Mover space, they roll two dice, find the corresponding card, and the share prices all change.  Players get one wild card at the beginning of the game, which can be used to change the market whenever they want according to the card.  Share prices over time are kept track of on a nifty wipe-off board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with both play money and shares and with trading worksheets, and players can use one, the other, or both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
