			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liquid War is an abstract war game in which each player controls a horde of colored pixels with whom he has to try to surround and eat enemy pixels. He controls the rally point to which each pixels tries to find the shortest paths. If he encounters enemy pixels they collide and fight which wears them down and converts them to the color of the enemy. If a pixel gets attacked from behind (the direction opposite of his current movement) he gets consumed very fast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
