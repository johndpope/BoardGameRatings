			<description>(From the back Cover)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crack parachutists decend out of the night. Their target: the bridge vital to the sucess of a spearhead allied attack only hours away. The bridge is wired and mined for detonation and&lt;br/&gt;intelligence reports suggest that an SS Panzer Division is in the area. As the paratroops gather in their chutes, ready their gear, and form up their attack, they know that split-second timing and speed are their only chances for success...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elite Rangers check their weapons and grapples and eye the cliff that rises from the beach into the pre-dawn mists. Their mission: hit the German battery at the top and hit it hard, before the Allied invasion fleet comes into range. A mortar blast geysers water beside the boat and someone cracks a lame joke about the welcome mat being out. Raw guts and determination are the only hope now...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A combat infantry squad peers from the cover of scattered trees and boulders along the crest of a ridge at the river below. Their problem: the last bridge over the last river between them and friendly lines lies below and the intelligence they have gathered about Panzers in the area must be returned to HQ, and fast. There is a slight complication: a Tiger I tank squatting by the road on the near bank. Only daring and inqenuity can get them back from...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BEHIND ENEMY LINES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behind Enemy Lines is a role-playing game which allows you to take on the character of a U.S. Infantryman in World War II. Parachute drops, night raids, sniper ambushes, pitched battles,&lt;br/&gt;combat patrols, and long-range reconnaissance probes are the challanges you face. Your enemy is cunning, well-trained and well-equipped. Your ingenuity, your courage, and skill are&lt;br/&gt;all that stand between you and disaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
