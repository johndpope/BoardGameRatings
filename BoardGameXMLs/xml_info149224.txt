			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the moment you first held it in your hands, you have become attached to your sword. You were inseparable, taking on any foe that crossed your path without hesitation. Over time the sword became an extension of yourself, and it began to give you the ability to do things most normal people could not. Without the sword you were nothing, and without you your sword was nothing, but now that the two of you have been attuned to each other after so many years, there was nothing you couldn&amp;rsquo;t do together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Items of Legend provides a rule set and examples of items that grow in power through exposure to their owners, gaining levels in the same manner as a player character and unlocking new abilities as they progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement includes 6 new artifacts usable by a variety of character classes (fighters, mages, bards, etc.) whose powers will expand as the players grow in levels. Each artifact comes tailored with an origin story and provides DMs at least 2 quests, including final encounters, for how to unlock the artifacts full powers; the quests include new solo monsters, skill challenges and adventure hooks the DMs can use that are based on the item&amp;rsquo;s origin story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Items of Legend is designed to be used under the Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edition rule set, and the guidelines provided here could be used at any level: from entry-level Heroic heroes to Epic demi-gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
