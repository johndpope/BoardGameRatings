			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the dark reaches of Blackthorne, an army is summoned; an army unlike any other this world has ever known. It is an army of death and despair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lexor calls in an ancient tongue. He calls to legions of skeletal warriors from battles since forgotten. No corpse can resist, and none tries, as Lexor assembles the world&amp;rsquo;s most deadly battalion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon completion of his army, Lexor marches north and conquers each of the seven sister kingdoms. Although each fights valiantly, Lexor&amp;rsquo;s army proves too great a force. After the final kingdom falls, Lexor summons the spirits of the worst tyrants Blackmore has ever known. Each is given a castle as Lexor&amp;rsquo;s lords and each rule, as mercilessly as they had in life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After Lexor&amp;rsquo;s conquest, most able-bodied men are transformed into slaves or left without the courage to oppose him. The few who do attempt to overturn the generals are publicly executed or made into hideous mockeries of their former selves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goals in The Red Crystal are to find Lexor and the Seven Secrets of Life. The Seven Secrets of Life are said to be the key to Lexor&amp;rsquo;s destruction. There may be truth to this as Lexor has resurrected seven of Blackmoore&amp;rsquo;s most vile and powerful men to guard them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of these generals resides in one of the seven castles scattered throughout Blackmoore. All secrets may have been created equal hut Lexor&amp;rsquo;s generals were not. The backgrounds provided are helpftil in gaining an initial knowledge of the generals. More may be learned through conversations with villagers and other adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
