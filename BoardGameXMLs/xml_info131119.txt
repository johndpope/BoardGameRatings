			<description>The Very Bad Game is a board game based on the wacky characters and themes of the immensely popular Bad Book series by Andy Griffiths - one of Australia's most successful writers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;For ages 7 and up, the game is easy to play and always fun. Players race around Badtown trying to find the 4 missing pieces of their lost pet. But it's not easy! They have to get past the weird and wacky folk of Badtown - who will send them every which way around the board for all kinds of very bad reasons. And watch out - the whole town may even blow up! It's a lot of nonsense and riotous family fun!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three dice are used - The Bad Die, The Very Bad Die and The Highway Die (which is used to cross the highways).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is expected to be the must-have companion to the Bad Book Series and the perfect gift for the hundreds of thousands of Griffith's fans. Developed in partnership with Andy Griffiths, The Very Bad Game is a genuine extension to the books - including 200 hilarious Very Bad Cards.&lt;br/&gt; It is cetain to bring hours of family fun with excellent game play, laughter, the enjoyment of reading and a little strategy. It is also a visual treat! Just like the books, the game includes hundreds of illustrations and a stunning game board by Terry Denton that bring the world of Badtown to life as only Terry can.&lt;br/&gt;(Source: Relatively Creative website)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
