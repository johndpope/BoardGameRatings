							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Duet Bridge</name>
									
			<description>This is one of the many bridge games designed for two players. Play is exactly like Contract Bridge with a few exceptions. Players sit in the North and East positions. The hand is dealt normally, but a player places his &amp;quot;partner's&amp;quot; cards in a dummy rack that holds the cards at an angle so that he can see them sitting across the table while his opponent cannot. Bidding is normal except that the players can see all the cards in both their hands. The only other difference is that the declarer does not lay down his dummy's cards but shows them one at a time per trick: otherwise three entire hands would be exposed to the declarer's opponent (and thus make the game pointless).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is helpful for beginners trying to get a grasp of the bidding process, but also fun for experts who want to calculate their bids with full knowledge of two hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
