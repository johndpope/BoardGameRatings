							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beard! The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Beard! is a casual, silly, Beer &amp;amp; Pretzel style game for 2-6 players. This card game takes you on a  a ridiculous romp through reality as you compete with your friends to grow the first truly epic beard! Will you become a Lumberjack, face down Ninja! or find True Love? All is possible when trying to grow the greatest of all beards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is simple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The player with the largest beard chooses who goes first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. The first player draws a Save Or Shave card (SOS Card), reads it out loud, and does what it says. Hopefully, it tells you to draw Beard! Cards, but it might tell you to lose Beard! Cards, Steal the Cards of others, roll a six sided die, or choose between multiple options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Play continues clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Each Beard! Card has one letter: B, E, A, R, or D. The first person to have one of each Beard! Card, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
