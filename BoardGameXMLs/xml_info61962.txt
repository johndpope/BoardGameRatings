			<description>Two groups of ants try to get to a pot of honey in the middle of the game board. They get toward the pot by passing several concentric rings of squares. Movement is determined by two dice; in each turn, two ants can move. Playing pieces can be stacked up to three high; a stack of three cannot be moved over. The first player to get five pieces into the inner ring around the honey is the winner - but the five pieces have to be alone or on top of their respective stacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
