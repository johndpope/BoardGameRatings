							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">AFFLICTION: Salem 1692 â€“ Tactics Card Add-on Pack</name>
									
			<description>This Kickstarter bonus pack of eight cards (plus one rule card) gives players the option to purchase colonist enhancements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The eight cards are shuffled and two are turned face up. A player may send a messenger to assign a tactic card to a colonist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards include such traits as Opposition, Rumors, Political Maneuvering, Petition, Rousing Speech, and Pardon from the Governor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They were initially added to Kickstarter copies of the base game in a separate package. They are still handed out by the publisher at conventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
