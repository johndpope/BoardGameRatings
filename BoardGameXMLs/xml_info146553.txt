							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Red Solstice</name>
									
			<description>The Red Solstice is a strategic, team-based action shooter from the top-down perspective with a strong focus on unique and cooperative multi-player. It is set in humanity's dark, final hours on a lonely, isolated Mars colony. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those rare games that go beyond standard cooperative games in which players only need to watch for friendly fire and item setup.&lt;br/&gt;Background&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Red Solstice is loosely based on a popular mod for Warcraft 3, called Night of the Dead. Night of the Dead community has been active for more than 5 years now and it features several maps played across the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
