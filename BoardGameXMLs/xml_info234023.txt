							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Forest Giant</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forest Giants are vicious bandits and raiders from the edges of civilization. Able to pass in and out of the woods quickly and quietly, regions haunted by Forest Giants never quite enjoy peaceful times - the next raid could always be just around the corner. Thankfully, Forest Giants are rare compared to other kinds of giant, preferring the solitude of deep, trackless forests and only emerging to take what the lesser races have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infused with innate druidic magic, forest giants can speak with plants, teleport between trees, and call up the brambles of the woods to attack enemies. Their natural leafy coverings also allow them to blend in with the forest canopy - a natural consequence of their size. While their natural talents might earn them some respect from other giants, forest giants instead scorn giant society and prefer to go their own way - raiding or attacking their kin just as often as anyone else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forest Giants do not take slaves, mostly stealing or doing banditry to get things they can&amp;rsquo;t make themselves, like metal weapons and shiny, finished goods. Lazy to a fault, they much prefer to rob under threat violence or demand tribute than actually kill anything. After all, they&amp;rsquo;re smart enough to understand that dead humans aren&amp;rsquo;t going to have more things to steal next time they come around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though forest giants mostly act as isolated tribes, they are willing to cooperate with other forest dwellers - usually fey and fey-adjacent creatures like Lank Boars and Trumpeters of the Dark Woods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
