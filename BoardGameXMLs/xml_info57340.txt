			<description>This accessory was written for TSR's Greyhawk line shortly before it was canceled. The text of unpublished book was instead released as an RTF file on the publisher's website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description taken from the introduction to the book:&lt;br/&gt;The Great Kingdom is sundered, collapsed into chaos after the terrible Greyhawk Wars. An insane overking, advised by a malefic priesthood and conversing with fiends atop his malachite throne, slew and revivified many of his local noble rulers as animuses, undead creatures of cold, hateful passions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great armies once the envy of the Flanaess wander the lands as freebooting mercenaries and pillagers, stripping the once-abundant treasures of this great nation. More than 300 years of slow degeneration and decline have climaxed in an appalling tragedy. Hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children have perished, and many more will follow in the years ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this merciless nightmare of insanity and cruelty, only a few pockets of resistance fighters, good and valiant rebels, can be found. Made up of rangers, druids, bards, and woodsmen of the great forests of Aerdy and the Lone Heath, they struggle against the growing evil and oppression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ivid The Undying is an extensive guidebook to the Great Kingdom and its many lands, expanding on the information presented in From The Ashes. The first chapter summarizes the history of the Great Kingdom of Aerdy. The following chapter details its peoples and rulers, laws, royal houses, merchants and peasants, powerful factions (armies, mercenaries, humanoids, fiends, and others), commerce, trade, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
