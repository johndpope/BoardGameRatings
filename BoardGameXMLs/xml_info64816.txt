							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Showdown! Battle Royal</name>
									
			<description>Showdown! is a turn based card game. Each player starts with a leader that is out of play and five cards (max hand size). Two cards are drawn each turn and the players may play any number of soldiers and weapons on his/her turn. In order to attack another player's soldier he/she must have an attack card. The attacker chooses both his soldier and the target soldier and may disarm the target with a disarm card. The defender may respond at this point with a disarm if he/she has one. Each player in the fight rolls a die and adds up the bonuses from weapons, upgrades and one shot cards. The highest number wins with ties going to the defender. The loser may play a reroll card on his/her opponent if the player has one. Once three soldiers are in a players soldier discard pile, that players leader is in play and may attack. The leader may only be attacked if the player has no other soldiers out. Be the last one left with a leader in play and win the battle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This card based battle game that will require both strategy and luck. Get ready to choose a side in this epic fight that will answer the question once and for all. Who's cooler?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set combines Ninjas, Pirates, Knights and the Undead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play your soldiers! Protect your leaders! Equip them with weapons and accessories! Play attack cards on your opponents soldiers in order to clear the way to their leader. Roll the dice and add your bonuses and hope it's more than your opponent. He rolled a 6?
