			<description>Bible Bafflers, Jr. is a Bible trivia game with questions belonging to one of 5 different subjects: Old Testament, New Testament, People, History/Geography, and Other Bafflers. Correct answers are scored on a bingo type of scorecard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game (quoted from the game rules):&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;To win, a player must answer enough questions to complete a straight line of Bafflewinks across the Baffleboard in any direction -- horizontal, vertical or diagonal.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Bafflecard lists 5 numbered questions all of the same subject, with the correct answers given on the reverse side of the card. A numbered question is determined by flicking the spinner, and the player answers that question from the top card on the draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a correct answer is given, the player places a Bafflewink on the same number in the column under its subject heading on his Baffleboard. If there is a Bafflewink already on that spot, the player must answer a question from the next card, otherwise play passes to the next player on the left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Baffleboard is basically a 5x5 bingo card, but only the player who answered the question correctly places a Bafflewink on his Baffleboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;20 different Baffleboards&lt;br/&gt;200 different Bafflecards- 40 each in one of 5 subjects&lt;br/&gt;105 Bafflewinks (small red transparent discs)&lt;br/&gt;1 spinner&lt;br/&gt;1 set of rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bible Bafflers, Jr. may be played along with the original Bible Bafflers game. It is suggested that the younger players answer questions from the Bible Bafflers, Jr. cards, and the older players answer questions from the original game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team play is allowed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tenwinks is a variant for 2 experienced players. Each player plays with only 10 Bafflewinks. If a player answers a question correctly but all 10 Bafflewinks are already on the player's Baffleboard, then one of those Bafflewinks must be moved to the spot corresponding to the current correct answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in 1984 by Paraclete Press.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
