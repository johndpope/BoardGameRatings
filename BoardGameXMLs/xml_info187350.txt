			<description>The Mystigo Game Kit is a party pack designed to be played by any group of people easily at any social occasion.

The Kit includes four stand alone card games diverse in themes and tactics, so there's a game to appeal to any group. Do you want to build the world's greatest art collection, or create strange creatures in a crazy genetics lab? Perhaps you prefer to throw a cow into a tornado or send drunken dwarves down the mine to fetch you glittering gemstones? Make your choice, teach the game in moments, and play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mystigo Games Kit includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gallerist: Bid against other players to acquire the best collection at the most expensive art auction of the century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;60 Dwarves: The race is on to hire the best dwarves and send them into the treacherous mine for valuable gems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trust Me!: A classic European bluff-tastic card game is made more colorful and crazy, with new mechanics and cards introduced into the mix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr Blender's Lab: Dr Blender has mixed up the body parts of the strange creatures in his genetics lab, and it's up to you to put them back together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
