			<description>&amp;ldquo;Each player controls a small town in a fantasy setting. Every turn players build structures and hire heroes to defend their town. Some cards are used to send monsters and disasters to destroy your opponent&amp;rsquo;s towns. The Deck: The deck has 75 cards. These will have to be constructed before play is possible. Object: Have the most defenders and structures at the end of the game. Each defender and structure is worth 1 victory point. The game ends when the last card is drawn from the deck. In a multiplayer game, the game ends if all but one player&amp;rsquo;s town is destroyed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
