			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a series of items, events and occurrences that could be found in a haunted, or otherwise creepy, house. Many of them are suitable for any setting or time period, whilst a few require settings having a technology equivalent to the 19th or 20th centuries depending, as they involve technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not every encounter is immediately obvious as being disturbing; some of them will require players to be paying close attention. Others stand out more noticeably. Whether or not any of the encounters have a negative effect is up to the Game Master. The various items tend more to supernatural and cosmic horror than to gory horror, but there are a few examples of the latter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are one hundred items which can be chosen randomly using a d100, or required ones can be chosen. They are laid out in a table, with each entry having a name of what type of encounter it is, then details of the encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page of the supplement is the cover, one the front matter and instructions and the remainder is the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An example result is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Door - As a player passes a door, it slowly opens, revealing the room beyond. When the room is entered, nothing is in it. If the door is closed after it opens, as the player leaves it behind, it gradually opens again behind them. The room behind it is still empty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
