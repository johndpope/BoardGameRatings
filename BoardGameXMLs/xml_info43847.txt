			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         STORMBRINGER reveals more about my own fantasy books and characters than I could have guessed! It does not merely derive from the books &amp;mdash; it complements them perfectly.&lt;br/&gt;The game is delightful.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;Michael Moorcock&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uh oh...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You knew you were in for trouble when you answered the strange offer for work &amp;mdash; few sailors in those northern parts are offered a noble's pay in gold for a voyage with winter coming on, and fewer still are offered the job from a Melnibon&amp;eacute;an wizard. Gads! What horrid eyes he had, red as blood, and skin as pale as a corpse's. But the money was good and plenty, and there was little more to do in a frigid city like Banarva. Besides, who else but a famed Tarkeshite sailor like you could handle that strange ship?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But this? What can you do against an Elemental Lord like Grome (pictured at right), who can toss huge ships, even magical ships, about like bath toys? What about Elric, the one who hired you? He's a brooding sort, and no mean sorcerer either. He'd have your head before you could turn to face him. And his sword, Stormbringer, is supposed to hold the fate of the Young Kingdoms within its eldritch blade. Maybe they can do something about this Grome. . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STORMBRINGER&amp;reg; is an easy-to-play game of fantasy roleplaying. Participants in the game create imaginary characters who go adventuring through a fantasy world where magic is real and heroes exist. Characters can begin play as a sailor, warrior, priest, noble, hunter, merchant, or even a beggar, working and fighting through adversity to gain magic, money, and fame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This box contains everything needed to create and play such adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INCLUDED IN THIS BOX &amp;mdash; Stormbringer Rulesbook (art by Frank Brunner, welcome to the Young Kingdoms, character generation, weapons &amp;amp; combat, skills, sorcery, cults, creatures, hints for the game master, statistics for characters from the novels, sample summonings, game tables &amp;amp; charts, introductory scenario), Map of the Young Kingdoms (22&amp;times;28&amp;quot;). Playaids (eight major character forms, sixteen minor character forms, eight demon forms, eight page reference booklet, twenty-five character &amp;amp; creature silhouettes), six polyhedral dice (one 4-sided, three 6-sided, one 8-sided, one 20-sided).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
