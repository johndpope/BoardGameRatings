			<description>Abstract game of memory and pattern recognition. Players have two pieces in their hands and each round have to play one piece on the table, creating the board and buy a new piece to their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each piece is made of 3 connected hexagon, with different colors and shapes. To place pieces on the board, players need to connect at least 2 different hexagons matching or the colors or the numbers, or a mix of both from their hand to pieces already on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces can be placed adjacent to other pieces in the same level or placed over other pieces. Higher a piece is placed, more score a player gets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game ends when no more pieces can be added to the board and the player with higher score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
