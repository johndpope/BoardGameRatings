But all this production might just wake a few monsters from the Earth of old... Goooooodziiiiiilaaaaaaaas!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Godzillas are now awaken and are going to walk around your city!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the first 4 rounds, the Godzillas are still sleeping. At the end of Round 5 and each Round till the end of the game, all the players roll one  6 Die, the highest roll will host one Godzilla. The Godzilla first appear in the Harbour, then in Factories level 3, 2 and so on... Then they must move in the city, the player still decide the direction. Each citizen on his path are swallowed and each Building becomes inactive.&lt;br/&gt;The players track the Radioactivity with black discs. &lt;br/&gt;It is possible to clean 2 black discs if the player choose the Engineer action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also...
