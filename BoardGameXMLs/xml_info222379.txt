			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ever After: Twisted Realm is a unique objective based Board game where player takes a role as a character from one faction between &amp;ldquo;Dawnguard&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Eclipse&amp;rdquo;. Each player is secretly assigned a team at the start of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no player elimination in this game. Player wins or loses with the team by comparing team victory points. Player gains VP (Victory Point) by completing quests, controlling areas and bonus power from identity skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts by dealing character card secretly to each player as Identity Card. Then randomly select leftover character cards to make a draft pool for Partner Cards. Each player will have 1 secret Identity card and 1 Face-up Partner card. The partner card will have its ability during game play while the identity card will define your team and guide your play style by its extra score condition.&lt;br/&gt;Player plays the game by moving around the map to complete the quest, conquer more areas, attacking other players or killing world boss. Player will get to know other players identity through rumor system which will let you know some information and guess from their actions.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, all victory points gathered from each player will be summed up as team score and the team with higher score wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
