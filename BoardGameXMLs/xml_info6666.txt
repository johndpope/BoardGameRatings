							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Forte Trivia Cards, Volume One</name>
									
			<description>These came out at the height of the Trivial Pursuit craze in the early 1980s and has rules as a stand-alone trivia game or for use with Trivial Pursuit.  Like the official expansions of the time, this one has 1000 cards with 6000 questions and answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The categories are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soaps: Peyton Place, Dallas and beyond Another World&lt;br/&gt;Cartoons: Bugs Bunny, The Flintstones, Pink Panther and more&lt;br/&gt;Space: Sputnik to Star Wars, Buck Rogers to Apollo&lt;br/&gt;Famous Pairs: Antony and Cleopatra to Bette Davis' eyes&lt;br/&gt;Advertising Slogans: Memorable lines that sold us all&lt;br/&gt;Fairplay: If it's trivia, it's eligible&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The back of the box promised three more sets of Forte Trivia Cards.  Forte Trivia Cards Volume II has a BGG entry, although its description says it contained only 363 cards instead of the promised 1000.  But Volumes 3 and 4 were, to the best of my knowledge, never produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were some good questions, but a bunch of gamers in their twenties had no idea for the answers to the Soaps questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
