			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Positrons. Neutrinos. Photons. These are just a few of the nuclear particles threatening to blow your ship apart. There's nowhere to run! No way of escaping! To survive, you must fight them. But that's only half the battle. While you try to destroy these dangerous particles, you must also try to stop the reactor's expanding core before it reaches melt-down. So board your ship and prepare to enter the awesome depths of REACTOR!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to destroy as many nuclear particles as you can before they smash your ship into the kill wall and to knock down as many sets of control rods as possible to stop the melt-down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
