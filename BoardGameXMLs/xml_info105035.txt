							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Command Combat: Civil War</name>
									
			<description>In Command Combat: Civil War, you take the role of a real, historical general leading his forces into battle. Choose who you will be, and what brigades you will have in your force, and lead them against other historical figures utilizing the unique Command Combat system, which streamlines combat to a simple format which focuses on how the personalities of the various generals effect the result of combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as the stoic Grant, the flamboyant JEB Stuart, the cautious, yet beloved George McClellan, or even the marble man himself, Robert E. Lee. There are many generals and specialized units to choose from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Command Combat not only puts you in the general's seat, but also gives a sense of how difficult it is to control an army. Players only have control over the generals they are playing. All other units are restricted to a color coded group of orders that are given to them, and can only break out of those restrictions when given new orders. This, and other specialized rules give the game a more realistic flavor, and helps the players understand why certain battles went the directions they did.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Put on the general's uniform and lead your men to victory in the most dynamic struggle in American history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
