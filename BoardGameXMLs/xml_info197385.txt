			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the Doctor, a scientist from New York. You're dying. Unable to stop the disease, you leverage your company's unbelievable achievements &amp;ndash; human cloning, hyper-accelerated growth, and your own Zulu method of neurocoding &amp;ndash; to create a copy of yourself. You won't survive, but maybe he will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first attempt is a disaster. You try again. And again. Your failures teach you, eventually, that though the clones share your Zulu-imprinted knowledge, they are unable to access your memories. They cannot empathize with what they know, cannot accept and affirm their past actions, and anyway have no ego present into which they can integrate those affirmations. Without these things, the clones go instantly mad and soon die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Problem-solving, however, is your strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game requires exactly three players.  Each player assumes a defined role.  Play proceeds with shared narration.  Any difficulties are resolved with a simple majority vote.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
