			<description>This is the successor of the highly successful game of KARGO from the same company, in this edition in the line of the &amp;quot;Double feature Games&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game consists of 54 illustrated cards: 29 distance cards, 12 putt cards, 1 holed out card and 12 hazard cards. As second feature added is a distance indicator chart and 4 numbered, very tiny golfballs (4 mm diameter).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to get the ball into the Hole in the least number of turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is the same as in Kargo: Players try to drive their ball and in the meantime to hinder the opponent to do so. Special rules apply for using which wood or iron in certain situations , the same goes for the hazard cards and their counterplays. Driven distances are marked with the golfballs on the indicator chart.&lt;br/&gt;Further added is a list of real golfcourses and their distances to play for the competitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
