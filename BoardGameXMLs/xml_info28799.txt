			<description>Flange-ended bulb whistle is inserted into question space and bulb is squeezed.  If whistle sounds, answer is correct.&lt;br/&gt;Each player has three chances to answer a question. If question is answered correctly on the first try, player scores 5 points, second try 3 points and third try 1 point.  No score is given if player fails to answer question after three tries.  &lt;br/&gt;Starting player selects the first question appearing on the top row of the card, takes his turn and scores accordingly. Next player takes the next question appearing on the top row and proceeds in the same manner. Players continue across row after row, each player taking a new question whether or not his predecessor has answered the previous question correctly.   When all questions on the card have been used, a new card is put in the box and play continues.  Highest score for all six cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
