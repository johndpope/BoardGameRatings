			<description>In Intelligent Design each player attempts to create the conditions necessary for life to evolve in his/her solar system.  The players do this by flicking planets across the board and utilizing gravitational fields to move the planets around each other and the suns.  Players must also be wary of the black-hole in the center of the board that can swallow up the planets left within its gravity field.  The game relies upon a mix of skill and strategy creating exciting shots and chin scratching moments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intelligent Design is played on a board with a hexagonal grid.  The grid has 6 solar systems centered on each sun and a black-hole in the center space.  Each player has a set of 10 planets and 2 score tokens in a color that matches the color of a solar system and grid edge.  The planets each have a number between 1 and 8 printed on them and come in three different sizes.  The number on the planet indicates the mass of the planet and its ability to orbit(moving adjacent) planets with smaller numbers.  Each player will take turns flicking and orbiting planets on the board attempting to get as many planets into the Goldilocks Zone of their sun.  The planets are worth an amount of victory points based upon their size with the smallest(and most vulnerable) planets worth the most and the largest worth the least.  Players will have the opportunity to score the planets in the Goldilocks Zone of their sun three times during the course of the game, twice by using score tokens on their turn and again during final scoring.  The winner is the person that has earned the most VP throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
