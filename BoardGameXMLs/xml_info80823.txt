			<description>Back of box description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 240 Legends. Full Customization. This is Football Resurrected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spiritual successor to the ESPN NFL 2K series. Since EA signed an exclusivity deal with the NFL, 2K obtained the rights for over 240 retired players to appear in the game. Although there aren't any NFL teams in the game, the player can still create teams that resemble their NFL counterparts. A Create-a-Player feature allows the player to add players who were not included on the original roster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
