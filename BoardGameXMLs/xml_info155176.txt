			<description>Pew Pew, Die is a Rock, Paper, Scissors-like game using two Looney Labs pyramid dice (called a pew-pew die for this game). The pew-pew die is marked on each side with one or two triangular symbols denoting attack and defense capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each players starts with the pew-pew die in his or her hand and mixes it around in their palm before starting. Facing one another, the players open their hands revealing the die faces. Each player can then twist their die up to 90-degrees either clockwise or counter-clockwise to orient the faces into a desired attack and defense configuration.  The players then determine the result of the initial round based on the attack, defense and orientation of the pew-pew die and then make moves from this initial position to conclude the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each round thereafter a player's die can only be changed in the following ways:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) A die can be rotated 90-degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise only after flipping&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) A pew-pew die can be flipped onto its front (the side closest the opponent), left or right sides&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play proceeds for as many rounds as the players desire, up to a pre-determined number of wins -- typically three works best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is inspired by the dice jousting mechanism used by Bushi Shogi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
