							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Advent Rising</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Advent Rising is a third-person, science fiction action-adventure video game. It was developed by GlyphX Games and published by Majesco. The game was released on May 31, 2005 for Xbox and on August 9, 2005 for Microsoft Windows. The story of this game was created by Donald Mustard, and featured a script written by famed sci-fi writer Orson Scott Card and Cameron Dayton. The full orchestral soundtrack was done by Tommy Tallarico. As of September 14, 2006, Steam began offering Advent Rising for download as well as other games by Majesco. (Advent Rising on Steam) At release on Steam, it cost $14.95 USD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advent Rising was the first in a planned trilogy which also saw the development of a game that would take place alongside Advent Rising, called Advent Shadow for the PSP. However, the game's retail performance fell short of expectations. By the end of 2005, Majesco Entertainment had completely revised its business plan to focus towards handheld games and canceled plans for future Advent Rising games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A five-issue spin-off comic book series was produced and ran from October 2005 to November 2006 (see Comics section below). Plans for novel tie-ins by Orson Scott Card never came to fruition.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Advent_Rising,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
