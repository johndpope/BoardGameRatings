							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragon Quest 1 and 2</name>
									
			<description>Not two boardgames as the name would suggest, this is actually one boardgame based off the first two games in the Dragon Quest video game series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map is of an entire continent. You draw a quest card at the beginning of the game, and that gives you your victory conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's lots of different types of cards: other than the quest cards, there's monster cards, weapon cards, item cards, and event cards. For movement, two dice are rolled. The higher die roll is your movement. If you roll a '1' and a '6' however, then a monster appears in the center of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart from the Japanese ruelbook, there is Japanese text on most fo the cards in the game, although mostly it is about two lines of text to go along with a picture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
