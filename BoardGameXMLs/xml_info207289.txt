							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Soldiers</name>
									
			<description>This is a WWII-era target game. The targets are cardboard soldiers that are inserted in wooden stands. The shooting mechanism is a wooden cannon powered by an elastic that shoots small wooden darts. While the box shows a twin-engine American starred airplane, the soldiers themselves are still in Napoleonic-era uniforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring is simple: whoever knocks down the most soldiers wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The all cardboard and wood construction is consistent with wartime publication, and the cannon and stands are similar to the cannon version of Bomb the Navy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
