			<description>A fast action family word game for one or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to form as many vertical and horizontal words as possible within 6 minutes... or whatever time limit the players wish to set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, a player starts the timer, then randomly draws cubes from the bag one at a time. Each cube may be turned to any desired letter, and is then placed into any open square in the board. Once placed, letter cubes may not be moved or turned again. When the timer runs out, or the last letter is placed, the player's turn is over and his score is calculated for both horizontal and vertical words in the grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
