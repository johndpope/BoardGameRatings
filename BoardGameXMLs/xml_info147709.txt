			<description>From the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Universe is ending. Legends and Myths throughout the galaxy talk about a way to survive. The Oracle promises eternal life to the species that possesses it. The object of the game is to find the Oracle and hold it until the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players journey from planet to planet searching for useful items to aid them in their quest.&lt;br/&gt;They will engage other players with diplomacy cards as well as facing them in player versus player combat.&lt;br/&gt;Different weapon types include energy, physical, mental, fire, sound, and acid.&lt;br/&gt;One on one combat starts at long range. If neither player has died combat progresses to medium and then short range.&lt;br/&gt;Expect to be destroyed. There is no player elimination. Another agent of the species steps in to take the place of the deceased character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a lot of variation in the initial setup. Replayability is built into the design.&lt;br/&gt;After the Oracle is discovered, the universe begins to deteriorate. Planets start disappearing.&lt;br/&gt;Resources become scarce and combatants are pushed together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oracle is an exciting fast-paced game that you will find yourself playing multiple times a session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
