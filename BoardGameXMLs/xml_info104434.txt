			<description>Help Cargo Ships from Red Rabbit Rentals, Blue Bonnet Boating, Purple Pirate Parcels, and Green Gremlin Groceries into port by playing Tugboat cards that match their number or company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During gameplay you play Tugboat cards from your hand into your Tug Line in order to score Cargo Ships. You can score a Cargo Ship two ways; by playing 3 tugboats of the same company as the Cargo Ship, or by playing three tugboats that equal the number on the Cargo Ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first person to score 3 Cargo Ships wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
