			<description>&amp;quot;The game is a simulation of the hardships faced by the first English Colonists to the New World in the 1600s. Each player controls their own colony, modeled after Jamestown, the Plymouth Pilgrims, and the Boston Puritans.&amp;quot; The game consists of six card decks: a Leader Deck, Site Deck, Action Deck, Build Deck, Food Deck, and Hardships Deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game lasts 5 years. This represents the first 5 years of each players colony. Each Season is a turn, so the game runs for 20 turns.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Victory: The player with the most Victory Points (VP) at the end of the game wins.&amp;quot; Victory Points are scored for the number of Colonist Tokens, Land Purchase Tokens, and Buildings a player possesses at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
