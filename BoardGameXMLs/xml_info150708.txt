			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interesting burial sites and tombs are a mainstay of any underground complex.  But not every burial site can be a large, complex, crypt.  Every dungeon needs some individual caskets and monuments that commemorate the fallen where they fell. &amp;lsquo;Eighty Tombs&amp;rsquo; is a game aid to help the Game Master create small, single burial sites that can be quickly investigated as an episode in a larger quest.  This book provides complete descriptions for tombs that range from simple cairns to free-standing mausoleums, including descriptions of their occupants.  &amp;lsquo;Eighty Tombs&amp;rsquo; also gives the Games Master tables to generate the details of as many individual tombs as needed.  Some tombs have guards, some confer special abilities or curses, some hold treasure, and some are empty.  The occupant&amp;rsquo;s stories can provide ready-made hooks for Games Masters to link the tombs into other campaign elements.  The tombs can enhance a dungeon&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere, history, and flavor, or be used as one-time encounters.  A random selection table is provided to pick tombs as needed.  &amp;lsquo;Eighty Tombs&amp;rsquo; will be useful to every Games Master who needs to quickly design dungeons locations.
