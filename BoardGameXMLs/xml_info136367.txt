			<description>How Much Do You Know About New Zealand?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time Zone is the quiz game that&amp;rsquo;s both historical and fun. Developed in conjunction with the New Zealand School Curriculum, Time Zone will have you racing to complete a time line of events and placing New Zealand in a historical perspective as you do so. Do you know which came first, regular television broadcasts in New Zealand or Sputnik 1? Was the Great Depression before or after Jean Batten&amp;rsquo;s flight to New Zealand? These and other challenging questions will have your mind racing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time Zone includes ten different game variations so you can play for hours. You can choose to play with all the cards, just the New Zealand event cards, or just the world events. Play against others or race the clock to place ten event cards in a time line to win. Time Zone is great for challenging friends, and since it&amp;rsquo;s appropriate for ages 9 and up, the whole family can join in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
