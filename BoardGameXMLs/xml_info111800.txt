			<description>'Flicking through the Ages' is a 2-player dexterity civilization game created as part of the NaGaDeMon contest during the month of November 2011.  Aside from the obvious Through the Ages nod, FttA claims Flicochet, Tumblin Dice, Breakout and the classic carnival game of knocking over milk bottles as its primary pedigree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FttA aims to deliver the civilization 'feel' to a dexterity game playable in under 30 minutes and assembled from easy to find materials.  It combines five completely different minigames into a timeless struggle for cultural supremacy!  Players balance their actions by using population discs in the following ways:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Gather resources by flicking your disc down a platform decreasing in size with increased return for increased risk.&lt;br/&gt;2. Research new technologies by flicking your disc at one of four stacks of available technologies arranged like a breakout game and taking the block you strike.  Once obtained, players need to choose whether or not to add the technology to their list of abilities or to trade in the block to increase their population&lt;br/&gt;3. Declare war on the other player's civilization by flicking your disc at their researched technologies stacked in a pyramid.  Knock your opponent's blocks down to steal population, technology or colonies&lt;br/&gt;4. Vie for colonies by flicking your disc closer to the colony disc than your opponents&lt;br/&gt;5. Construct Wonders of the World by stacking resource cubes on a disc and sliding it along a path symbolizing the shape of the building without letting one fall&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTES:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Construction of 'Flicking Through the Ages' requires:&lt;br/&gt;1 set of Jenga-style blocks&lt;br/&gt;1 set (2 colors) of 'bakelite'-style backgammon discs or other discs of roughly 1.25&amp;quot; diameter that flick reasonably well and are heavy enough to impact a tower of Jenga blocks enough to fall over&lt;br/&gt;1 set of the rules including the 'colony' and 'technology' sticker sets to be applied (or taped) to the above components&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
