							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Long Neckers</name>
									
			<description>Long Neckers is an early childhood game, designed to teach matching skills and hand-eye coordination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns spinning the spinner, picking out matching giraffe neck pieces, and stacking them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with three neck pieces, one head, and one body. Whenever a player spins, any player with a matching piece may add it to his or her giraffe. Either player may end the game at any time by placing the head on his or her giraffe, at which point the opposing player has one more chance to spin and try to beat the first player. Whoever has managed to construct the tallest giraffe wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
