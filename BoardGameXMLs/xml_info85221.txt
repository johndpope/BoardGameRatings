			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dream Chronicles: The Book of Air is the fourth book in the Dream Chronicles franchise and the start of the Lyra&amp;rsquo;s Destiny trilogy. The player takes the role of Lyra, the daughter of the previous games&amp;rsquo; heroine Faye, on the day before her 18th birthday. Lyra is in her hometown of Wish when she hears a whisper and everyone disappears. In actuality, Lyra has been transported to a parallel dimension very similar to her own, and the only way she can return home is if she finds the Clockmaker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Book of Air plays similarly to the previous titles in the Dream Chronicles franchise, and the player needs to solve a large number of inventory-based puzzles and riddles in order to proceed. Some of the puzzles are very difficult to figure out as is common in point-and-click adventures, including some larger puzzles that require items from throughout the game. The game includes a hint system to help identify usable items in the different regions which can ease puzzle difficulty. Also, the player can travel between the game&amp;rsquo;s different regions quickly by using Fidget&amp;rsquo;s airship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
