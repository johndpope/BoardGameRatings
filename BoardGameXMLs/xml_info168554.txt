			<description>Nicole is thrilled that she managed to get into her first choice school and is looking forward to experiencing college life there. However, as soon as she moves into the university dorms, she finds out that there&amp;rsquo;s been a series of mysterious disappearances going on around the campus! So far, three girls have already gone missing and Nicole could be next if she&amp;rsquo;s not too careful &amp;ndash; not quite the ideal college experience Nicole had in mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nicole is a dating sim that revolves around your day-to-day life as a college student. You can take up part-time jobs to earn money, explore various locations, do recreational and extra-curricular activities, and meet intriguing characters like Darren, Kurt, Jeff and Ted. You might even get to date the culprit!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
