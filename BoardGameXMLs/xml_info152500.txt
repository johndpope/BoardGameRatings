			<description>The cavemen are out hunting but there is danger around every corner. You must help your caveman to avoid danger by keeping them as far away from the T-Rex as possible! The winner is not the first person to reach the end, instead you must use a little luck and the playing cards to dodge danger and avoid reaching the T-Rex's lair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
