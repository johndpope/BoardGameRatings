			<description>Features: &lt;br/&gt;Easy to play, an entire competition can be simulated in 1 session&lt;br/&gt;All gymnasts who appeared in the 2006 season are rated in each of 4 events: Vault, Uneven Bars, Balance Beam and Floor Exercise&lt;br/&gt;Individual scoring charts reflect the difficulty of each event, which when coupled with the athlete's individual rating for the event, give accurate scoring results&lt;br/&gt;Point deduction system included. Athletes' scores will be adjusted due to flaws in their performance&lt;br/&gt;Injury system allows for gymnasts who fall (either from an apparatus on during the floor exercise) to suffer injuries.
