			<description>Each player has an attache case, but only one has the one with the valuables. If you are the mafia, then you grab the valuables, and try to flee from the other players. If you are a detective, you go after the player you think has the valuables and try to catch them. Players can purchase tickets to allow them to flee to certain areas. If you catch another player, you can switch attache cases with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fifth in Grapac Japan's series of games under the label &amp;quot;Aeronaut&amp;quot;. They are meant to be very fast playing (around 15-30 minutes). They all come in a file-type holder, with the inside of the file being the game board, and all of the components attached to the ring-binder in bags and pouches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
