			<description>This is Sportsfan's Hoop Hysteria - The College Basketball Trivia game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an interesting sports trivia game for fans of college basketball.   Each round one player is the offensive team (home team starts) and rolls d6 that has four results (1/6) Turnover - lose possession. (4/6) Shot - Offense selects whether they are attempting 2pt or 3pt shot.   Defense reads the question and if the offense gets it right (separate questions for 2 and 3pt shots) they get the points.   Regardless of whether they answer correctly, play goes to the defense.  (1/6) Shot/Foul - Offense selects 2 or 3pt shot, but if they get it right, they get a shot at the 1pt bonus question too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 2,000 questions on NCAA Division I men's basketball trivia.  Contains questions on every major college basketball program.   Includes a scoreboard, a 60-second time, and a custom die.   Scores like a real game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
