			<description>Website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;A savaged supplement focusing on Psionics and the Supernatural in Savage Worlds RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the author's introduction:&lt;br/&gt;In keeping with the feel of the modern horror genre, you'll find that the offensive psychic powers, as given in the Savage Worlds rulebook, have been dropped.  There are a few powers that will help you against mundane opponents, but they've only been included to help you along until the main event -- taking on supernatural foes.  Some of these you'll defeat, some you won't; you'll often find that getting out alive is victory enough!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;... all the new powers presented here are Novice level.  Given the restrictions of Arcane Background: Psionics, this just made sense; these types of characters are born with one or two gifts, and that's all they ever learn; however, it's not impossible to hone one's abilities or learn additional powers -- it's just not that easy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;This supplement is available as a free download from Dragonsfoot.org&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
