			<description>Translation of the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;Game by simple rules, where necessary strategy and intelligence, you are faced with exciting challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tag line - Only players of a certain type are compared with hypo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card game the team who has the lowest score at the end of the match wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each card, there are two values: the points value of the card is in the center and the IPO value (the score a team gets for taking the round) is in an inset circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The value of the IPO for the round is determined by the card led in the round. The team wins the round gets the IPO score, which will tally throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example with 4 players: Player A1 play 5 (with an odd IPO of 25), player B1 plays 4, A2 player plays 6, B2 player plays 5. The total round is 20 (even) the first card played is 5 (odd). Team A failed to comply with the total odd then won the B team in the IPO will be 25.&lt;br/&gt;Wins points less than its IPO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
