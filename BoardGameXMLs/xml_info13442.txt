			<description>This is an old Parker Brothers game that simulates College Football. It comes with a board depicting a football field with a marker to show the balls location, and cards that showed play results. The player on Offense calls out one of the plays that the game allows - Off Tackle, Trick Play, Short Pass, Drop Kick (this was the 1920s), etc. The Defensive player then turns over the top card of the deck, reads the result of the play called, and moves the football marker on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although it is a simple game, it does have the basic mechanics of a modern football board game. The main difference is that the player on Defense does not also call a play to match up with play called by the Offensive player before the results are determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
