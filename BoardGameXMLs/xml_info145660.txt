			<description>Knight&amp;rsquo;s Quest conjures tales of Dragons, Fair Maidens, and Brave Knights in an easy-to-learn family fun game right out of the box!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knight's Quest is easy to learn, with players themselves providing plenty of twists and turns along the way. Be the first to play every card from your hand by matching the color or number of the previous card. Use Joust, Dragons, Wizards, Companions, and other special cards to improve your chances of winning!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knight's Quest is a standalone card game for 2-6 players, ages 8 and up. You can play a game in 30 minutes or less&amp;mdash;short enough to play while waiting for that monster board game to get set up. Knight's Quest is designed for lovers of classic card games like Crazy 8's, with gorgeous artwork by renowned fantasy artist Jeff Easley, and rising-star illustrator Peter Bradley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
