							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cheese, Please!</name>
									
			<description>Be the first to build an awesome sandwich. But beware of the mice, they want your cheese!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a sandwich with six ingredients they need to collect to complete the sandwich. Players start with three random ingredients and then on each turn, they can either choose a random ingredient from the pile in the center or they can ask another player if they have a certain ingredient. If you draw an ingredient, check to see if you can add it to your sandwich, if not put it behind your fridge. If you draw a mouse, it eats a piece of cheese from your sandwich(if you have one). The mouse is then removed from the game and the cheese goes back in the center pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until someone finished their sandwich.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
