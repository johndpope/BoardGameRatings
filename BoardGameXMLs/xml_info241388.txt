			<description>You are invited to a Killer Dinner! However, this is no ordinary dinner party. Everyone is masked and has their own hidden agenda. Who is your friend, and who is planning on stabbing you tonight?&lt;br/&gt;Ask questions, collect items, and attack other partygoers to accomplish your hidden agenda before anyone else. Blend in while figuring out your fellow partygoers&amp;rsquo; hidden agendas before it&amp;rsquo;s too late!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game each player gets a card with their secret role and hidden agenda. Attending the party are The Host, The BFF, The Trickster, and The Hitman. Everyone, except the Hitman, is also informed of the Host&amp;rsquo;s profession on their Role Card. &lt;br/&gt;The Host&amp;rsquo;s agenda is to figure out who the Hitman is and to kill them. &lt;br/&gt;The BFF&amp;rsquo;s agenda is to help and protect the Host. &lt;br/&gt;The Trickster&amp;rsquo;s agenda is to attack or get attacked a total of seven times. &lt;br/&gt;The Hitman&amp;rsquo;s agenda is to figure out the Host&amp;rsquo;s profession, or to kill them.&lt;br/&gt;While in the same room, players may ask each other yes/no questions to discern information about the Host&amp;rsquo;s profession, revealing who the Hitman is based on incorrect answers. Players explore the house and collect items upon entering an empty room. Items can be used to help gather information, attack other players, or replenish lost Health.&lt;br/&gt;Whoever accomplishes their hidden agenda first, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Killer Dinner is a party game that will create a new social dynamic each time it&amp;rsquo;s played. A great number of Host&amp;rsquo;s professions and the random role allocation, makes every game different. Due to the social aspect and asking questions the game is a good opportunity to get to know your fellows players better!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
