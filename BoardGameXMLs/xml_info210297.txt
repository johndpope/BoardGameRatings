			<description>Courtside Basketball by FTP sports Games is a full-stats simulation of pro basketball. Players are rated individually for both offensive and defensive characteristics. A few examples are the player's ability to shoot, pass, drive to the basket, draw and commit fouls, rebounds, steals, blocked shots. etc.  The game is played either using Play Result Cards or using the designer's self-created Gamecenter, an Excel spreadsheet that not only flips the cards for you, but also helps track the score and stats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After choosing your teams, you first set up the pre-game warm up, which includes whether referees will call the game tight (thus more fouls), normal mode or &amp;quot;let them play&amp;quot; (less fouls).  You also choose how physical the game will be depending on whether the teams historically are rivals or not. Finally, you assign each starter a specific color code, which will determine how often they control the ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play starts like any other basketball game, with the opening tip.  Once a team gains control, you first determine through team ratings if the offensive team will run a set offensive play or a faster transition play.  The play result cards or Gamecenter chooses the player by the color code and you choose to have the player shoot, drive to the basket, make a low post move or pass!  Random numbers determine if the basket is good, defensive stops, fouls, etc.  If the shot is no good, new cards drawn determine rebounding, blocked shots, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues as a regular basketball game in 15 second increments, however does capture the flow of a pro basketball game.  Each team is carded with every player who played for that team in the year chosen.  The game is played either solitaire or with 2 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
