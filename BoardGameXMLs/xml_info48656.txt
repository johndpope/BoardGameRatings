			<description> &amp;quot;This is a serious problem.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Ambassador Maya Landling sat back in the plush chair of her Port Oasis office. The digitally enhanced photographs on her desk clearly showed her friend and assisstant Jeremy Tessier in a romantic interlude with a local girl identified as Reyna Kross. Even before her head of security said so, Maya knew well that Kross was in the employ of AST Lord Protector Jacques Molay -- her most powerful political enemy. Maya took a breath before continuing, &amp;quot;Just what do you suggest?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &amp;quot;Well,&amp;quot; began Yannick, her security chief, &amp;quot;we might be able to use this. If we can manage them both we could perhaps get information on Molay rather than the other way around. It will take some careful moves, however.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &amp;quot;Too many of them, I'm afraid. We can't take unnecessary risks anymore.&amp;quot; Maya felt a pain rise in her chest; some would have called it remorse. &amp;quot;Deal with them both...and make it painless.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The single-most powerful nation on Terra Nova, the Southern Republic holds the entire South in its iron grip. Massive military might, a gargantuan intelligence community and an ingrained culture of national supremacy all keep the Republic the master of the Allied Southern Territories and a real and present danger to the Northern Leagues. But the so-called Land of the Snakes remains dangerous even for loyal citizens. Centuries of intrigue and betrayal are finally catching up to the great league and its political system is choking on a web of lies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Southern Republic Leaguebook gives Heavy Gear roleplayers and Gamemasters everything they need to set their scenarios in this dangerous land.  Among many other things, this sourcebook includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A complete history of the Republic&lt;br/&gt;     Details on the hidden world of the dreaded SRID and Temoins&lt;br/&gt;     Full write-ups (including maps) on all 12 Republican city-states&lt;br/&gt;     Information on the deadly SPFI terrorists from Saragossa&lt;br/&gt;     Sample Campaing set-ups&lt;br/&gt;     New character archetypes&lt;br/&gt;     New equipment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
