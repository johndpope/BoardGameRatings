			<description>The game contains 12 sets of four tiles showing items belonging to a particular profession. The cards are color-coded, so there is a blue, a red, a yellow and a green tile for each profession. &lt;br/&gt;One color is picked out and the 12 tiles are placed openly on the table. Each player picks one of these. &lt;br/&gt;Then players take turns flipping open a tile from the draw stack. If the tile belongs together with that player's first tile, he/she can keep it. Otherwise it is openly discarded. The next player can take it if he/she needs it, then draw a new tile as usual. When a player thinks he/she has 4 matching tiles, the tiles are placed on top of a large plastic cube. A mirror shows the backside of the tiles - if these form a picture of the profession, the player keeps the set. &lt;br/&gt;When all sets have been distributed, the player with most sets is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is themed for the a German children's TV show called &amp;quot;Die Sendung mit dem Elefanten&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
