			<description>&amp;quot;MELTDOWN is the nuclear energy conflict game based on one of today's most important issues - Nuclear Power. Each player or team is assigned six zones which they must make NUCLEAR FREE or NUCLEAR SAFE to win. Chance and strategy come into play as the gameboard and other players work to cause a NUCLEAR INCIDENT at the reactors in the zones. Real-life situations challenge players and add to the excitement, making MELTDOWN the most intriguing and important game of our time.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
