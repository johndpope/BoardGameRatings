							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Panama (パナマ)</name>
									
			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;パナマ (Panama) is a investment card game for 4 players only, which uses a deck of traditional playing cards and 20 card stands made with a 3D printer. The rules are available in Japanese and English. (In Japan, the standard deck of Western playing cards is known as a 'Trump' deck. Hence the designer explaining the game as a 'Trump Extension' game.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards numbered A, 2, 3, 4, 5, and two jokers are investment cards. Five cards each are dealt to the players. Cards numbered 6-10 are tax haven cards. Players try to earn positive tax haven cards by playing investing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you invest on a tax haven card, you place a card stand along a border of the tax haven card and insert an investment card you want to play, so that one player cannot see how much you invest. Up to four players can invest on a tax haven card, and the highest investor earns the face value of that tax haven card. But one pre-determined suit counts negative, and a joker also inverts the sign if involved. You should speculate about hidden cards and try to let negative points go to other investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can co-operate with one of other players by sharing complete information about what you play. But to win the game, you have to part ways in the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacks, Queens, and King are agent card. Each player has one of these at the beginning of a game, and can use it once for one shot effect, such as reversing order or skipping a player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's summary&lt;br/&gt;トランプ拡張ゲーム「パナマ」&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;トランプ(Playing Card)を&lt;br/&gt;・投資カード　・タックスヘイブンカード　・工作員カード&lt;br/&gt;に分け、場に出されたタックスヘイブンカードの周囲を&lt;br/&gt;投資カードを付属のカードスタンドで立てていき、点数を稼いでいきます。&lt;br/&gt;情報漏洩事務所(Panama paper office)への投資は減点となるため、他人におしつけます。&lt;br/&gt;トランプを立てて置くと、４人の内１人からは必ず絵柄が見えなくなるため&lt;br/&gt;プレイヤーは常に誰を騙すか選択することになります。&lt;br/&gt;協調することで点は増えますが、最終的には出し抜いて１位を目指します。&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
