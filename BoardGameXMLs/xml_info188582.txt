			<description>Grandma was right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nobody really believed her. Not even you, her favorite grandchild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But she was right. And more so than you could ever imagine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city before you, deep in the mist shrouded forest, can't be found on any map. It shouldn't even exist. Though it's been asleep for a long time, you feel a mysterious power begin to awaken from the ruins around you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legend has it the civilization that built this place could somehow control the seasons. But nobody listens to legends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nobody except Grandma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And she was right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You look again at the artifact she gave you. Close to this lost city, it almost seems alive in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city does exist. It's real.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Could the secret magic, powerful enough to change the seasons, be real too?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
