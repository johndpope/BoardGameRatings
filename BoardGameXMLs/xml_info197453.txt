			<description>This is a party game with potentially unlimited numbers of players (in teams if necessary). It involves solving crossword puzzles as clues are read aloud. There are 15 sets of ten cards, each of which has a riddle clue to one of the 10 5-letter solutions needed to complete a 5x5 grid. Each set also has a key card with the answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player becomes the Regent, donning a Mortarboard and choosing which set of cards to use. Next to him sits the Bard, who wears a badge and reads the clues aloud. When a player thinks he has solved the full puzzle, he calls Rhym-A-Gram, and all players' answers are checked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One point is given for each correct answer (10 max), and the high-scorer becomes Regent, the second-highest the next Bard, and the lowest scorer must put on a cheezy dunce cap until some other player manages to do even worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the event of a tie, players draw blind from a Poet deck. Each Poet card has a five-letter word and players must spontaneously come up with a rhyme using the word. Non-tied players judge the result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
