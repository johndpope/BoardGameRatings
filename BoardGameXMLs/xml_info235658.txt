							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ocean of Fire</name>
									
			<description>Ocean of Fire is Rob Beyma's design of the conflict that raged in the Pacific from 1941 to 1945.  This large, but playable, game features several countersheets covering the forces of Japan, the US and the Commonwealth forces that fought in this theater during WW-II, as well as those forces of the various other nations that were engulfed in the conflict that inflamed the Pacific.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ocean of Fire is the current working name, but accurately reflects the spread of the conflict from Japan's starting home areas to across the Pacific at the start of the game.  Eight turns cover the entire conflict, with some scenarios being shorter duration.  Counters generally represent divisions or brigades for land units, generic air points for air assets, and individual named capital ships (and their escorts) for naval vessels.  Cards are included as an optional variant that reflect many of the historical events (e.g. Stillwell's Chinese forces, Japanese night naval proficiency, etc.) that add additional flavor to the game with little additional overhead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
