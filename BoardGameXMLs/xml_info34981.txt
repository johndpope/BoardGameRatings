			<description>This is a clever game of setting up collections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regarding the time it was published, the theme of the game and last but not least the comic strip caricatures of Churchill, Hitler and some other populars of the time this is one of the rarest and for the collector most expensive game from the Pepys company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to secure points for merit. This is done by rising in the services (Army, Navy, Air Force and Home Services) in proper sequences, avoiding to include one of the penalty villains of Hitler-ruled Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clever card drafting and discarding rules coupled with nail-biting decision when to end a round (enhance your set or take the risk to draw a penalty) is even by modern standards a good game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the time this game was published the card quality was very high: thick cardboard with linen finish and brightly coloured printing add to the flair of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
