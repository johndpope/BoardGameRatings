			<description>A free promotional demonstration version of 51st State. This mini-version is distributed free in Poland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world you know no longer exists. There is no government. No army. No civilization. The United States have collapsed. And now, thirty years after the war started, new powers finally try to take control over the ruined country, try to establish a new order, try to control others and create a new country, a new State: the 51st State.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In standard 51st State there are 110 cards and many tokens. In this free demo version, there are only 40 cards. The game is playable for two players and presents the mechanics of the full version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this version players control one of the two powers (New York or Mutants Union) and try to build their very own new country. Players put new locations into the game, they hire leaders, and send people to work in buildings to gain resources and new skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every card can be put into play in three different ways. You can invade a location to gain many resources once, or you can sign a contract with this location to gain one resource every turn, or you can attach the location to your State so you can use its skill. One card, three possibilities. Lots of decisions and choices that matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Talia Demo 51. Stanu debuted in issue 25 of the Polish boardgame magazine Åšwiat Gier Planszowych.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
