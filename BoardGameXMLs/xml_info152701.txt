			<description>The objective of the game is to get 2 meeples (spaceships) from the starting area to the space station in the center of the board and back to earth on the opposite side of the board. The spaces on the board are holes. Below the board there is a rotating disk with some more holes in it. If a meeple falls in a hole it has to start at the beginning again. Whenever a meeple gets on a space of it's own color, the player has to rotate the disk in a direction of his choice. Thereby the player changes the color of the spaces and the postion of the holes, which may cause some meeples to fall back to earth. The winner is the player who is the first to get both meeples to the landing area.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The game was published in the 1950s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
