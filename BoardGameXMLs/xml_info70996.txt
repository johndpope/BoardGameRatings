							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brelin Swift (OGL 3.5)</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some men are drawn to danger and ruin like moths to a flame. This rare breed seeks out lethal conflicts, deadly beasts, and cunning foes with reckless abandon, forever searching for a greater conquest, for the ultimate thrill. Brelin Swift is one such man, but thankfully an honorable nature guides him towards battles that can benefit the world. Born into a noble family on a small prime material world, Brelin spent his adolescence on deadly safaris. His dabbling in the mystical arts provided broad new vistas to hunt: the elemental and outer planes. All the multiverse was his playground, and many of his battles led him to greater and greater mastery of strange spells and incantations which strengthened and empowered his body. And powerful he became. By the time he was 20, Brelin was known as a slayer of demons, devils, and worse, yet he was still not satisfied. He was a good man at heart but the hells could not be changed by his conquests. Dejected, he turned his attention to the mortal realms, and one world caught his attention - Exodus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
