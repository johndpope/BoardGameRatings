			<description>The American Civil War was a bloody conflict that took place 150 years ago between 1861 and 1865. After the war ended many Confederates said that the South would rise again. Now with the help of Wallet Battles their dream can come true.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wallet Battles essentially takes an old Civil War coin flipping game and combines it with the new micro board game concept to create a fun interactive game that can be enjoyed over and over wherever you go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Overview: &lt;br/&gt;Wallet Battles is a micro board game for two that is played on a plastic card that has battle maps available on both sides of the card. Players flip coins to earn the right to perform actions that will help them battle for ownership of various locations on the map. The key objective is to have the most points by the end of the game. To achieve this objective you need to control as much of the map as possible and build stacks of coins to strengthen your defenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup: &lt;br/&gt;Place the map you wish to use face up between both players. Now divide equally between both players a handful of coins. We recommend 6 quarters, 6 nickels, 6 dimes and 6 pennies for optimal play, however, any amount of coins can be used to manipulate the length of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decide who wants to represent the Confederates (Tails) and who wants to represent the Union (Heads).  If needed, a regular coin flip can be used to decide for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play: &lt;br/&gt;Each turn begins with both players flipping a coin onto a table. Each flip has three potential outcomes:&lt;br/&gt;Heads: Both coins show heads.&lt;br/&gt;Tails: Both coins show tails.&lt;br/&gt;Odd: One head and one tail is shown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the coins land on Heads the player representing the Union can place one of his coins on the map or if his opponent already has coins on the map he may capture one of his coins to place in his pile for later placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the coins land on Tails the player representing the Confederacy can place one of his coins on the map or if his opponent already has coins on the map he may capture one of his coins to place in his pile for later placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the coins land Odd the coin flip must be repeated. No other action is required, however, if Odd is flipped three times in a row all players must remove a coin from the map and return it back to their pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To strengthen your defenses you must build stacks of coins. Smaller coins must go on top of larger coins. Therefore, if your base coin is a dime you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to build a stack. You can&amp;rsquo;t build on your opponents stack, however, you can capture coins from him.&lt;br/&gt; Game End:&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all coins have been captured, your opponent is out of coins  or when all possible locations on the map have been used. Players earn 2 points for every location they control and 1 point for every coin located on the map. Stacks of coins consisting of three or more coins will be doubled in value. Any coins not used will be counted as 1 point. The player with the most points is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
