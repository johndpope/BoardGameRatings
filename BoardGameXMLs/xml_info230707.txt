			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons has always been a game about bravery and heroism, an adventurer fighting to survive in a world beset by magic and evil. It's a very short trip from there to the world of superheroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D&amp;amp;D games and superhero fiction have a lot in common. They are both tales of powerful, extraordinary individuals, some heroic, some definitely not, who go out and have adventures. Saving a town from being destroyed by a rampaging monster works equally well as a Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons sessions or an issue of a comic book. The core experiences fundamentally click.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original Heroes Wear Masks sought to bring superheroes to Pathfinder. This version gives the same treatment to Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 5th Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are familiar with Fifth Edition, you will recognize most of the rules. If you are familiar with superheroes, you will be familiar with most of the setting. If you are familiar with both, you will be right at home here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A metropolis strains under the weight of crime. The police are helpless against a new breed of costumed super-being. The city cries out for heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you answer the call, or help burn it to the ground?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
