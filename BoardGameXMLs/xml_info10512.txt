							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Munsters Masquerade Party Game</name>
									
			<description>Party fun with the Munsters!  Extremely rare and highly sought after children's game based on the campy '60s tv show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Roll and Move game. On some spaces, players may lose turns or move back a few space. When they land on a &amp;quot;Pick a Party Card&amp;quot; space, players must pick a card, read it aloud and must immediately follow directions as varied as singing a song, dancing or imitating animals. If they fail to comply, players lose their next three turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to move from start to finish wins. Players must spin the exact number needed to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
