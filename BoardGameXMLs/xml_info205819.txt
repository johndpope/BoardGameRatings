			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1876 &amp;mdash; the Gold Rush is rising up and the Wild West is full of adventurers, golddiggers and all kind of characters looking for the gold piece that will change their lives. The city of Black Hills is right in the middle of this struggle, and a tough mayor is needed to put things in their place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Hills is a resource management game for 2-4 players in which they need to accumulate resources to exchange them for status points. The first player to obtain five status points is appointed as the brand new mayor of Black Hills and wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has three different resources: wood, gold pieces and leather. In every round, each player chooses two character cards from the four cards they receive. There are 16 character cards between cowboys, settlers and indians; each character has its own ability and should be placed in one of four locations: woods, plains, city or the jail. Depending on the character and the locations, players acquire different resources or can invest their previously amassed goods in the city in exchange for status points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second deck of cards is the deck of the events. Every player can buy an event for the price of one gold piece and use it whenever they want. The events affect the regular development of the game, granting extra status points, closing locations, or forcing the rest of the players to lose some of their resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't want to invest your gold in event cards? Are you a more aggressive kind of player? Do you hate to manage resources? Keep calm because this is the Wild West and what would it be without some hired gunmen? In Black Hills, you can also use your money to hire a gunman to try to steal all the resources from your fellow players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what are you waiting for? Come to the city of Black Hill and find your luck, but watch out because you could end up with nothing in your pockets or a bullet in your head!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
