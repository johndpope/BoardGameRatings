							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle of Dark Age Britain</name>
									
			<description>The game is designed for students of college-level classes in which the history of Dark Age Britain is addressed. These could include classes in medieval or ancient British history or classes in Arthurian literature. The game may also appeal to anyone with an interest in British history, including Arthurian enthusiasts, and members of the general wargaming/Diplomacy crowd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The richest and strongest player or player alliance wins the game. &amp;quot;Victory points&amp;quot; are calculated by factoring in a player-king's wealth (cash-on-hand), the economic value of the lands he owns, the combat strength of his warbands, and &amp;quot;glory points&amp;quot; accumulated for killing opposition kings and princes in combat. Thus, the victorious player-king is the one most reknown for his wealth, combat prowess, and political/military power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
