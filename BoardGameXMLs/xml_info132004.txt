			<description>In Frogs! 2-4 players vie for control of the pond by surrounding their opponents' frogs to eliminate them. When only five frogs are left in the pond, the player with the most frogs left is declared the winner. (You can play until only one player is left, but that could make for a long game.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pond is composed of hexagonal cards with a lily pad on one side and water on the other. Frogs can move in any direction, but only on the lily pads and only one pad at a time. Every time a frog moves, the next card over gets flipped, providing a constantly-changing playing field. Frogs are eliminated when they are surrounded by a combination of water and/or frogs of a different color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
