							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Escape from Bahamut</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heart of the Red Star Commonwealth&amp;rsquo;s economy is the black market. Once this nation was strong, making Imbohl&amp;rsquo;s vision a reality, but now it is fragmented and corrupt. Where once the military might of the U.R.R.S. was a thing to be feared, it is now laughable, filled with selfserving officers, poorly trained soldiers, and equipment that is at best unreliable. Criminal elements thrive, smuggling in goods and services at prices far lower than the highly taxed legitimate products. Thanks to the destabilizing influence of the underworld, many soldiers and offi cers have given way to the temptations of selling illegal goods, such as drugs, arms, and protocols, to various fences. On the Nokgorkan front, there are plenty of opportunities for an offi cer to find just the right thing to lift him out of poverty and enjoy the lifestyle to which he was once accustomed. In the case of this adventure, that substance is opium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escape from Bahamut is a short adventure for four 1st-level heroes. With slight modification, you can make it suitable for heroes at other levels or for groups as large or as small as you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
