							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Of Gates and Gods (Sin City, Vol. 2)</name>
									
			<description>Something strange just crashed into a heavily populated region of NewCentennial City and someone is trying to keep it a secret.&lt;br/&gt;As the players investigate, they will be introduced to the subculture of the Citadel. The Citadel can be best described as the personal playground to the elite of New Centennial City. Big parties, big business and big money flow through this area at neck-breaking speeds.&lt;br/&gt;The Citadel is dangerously out of control. Greed and corruption can be found on every corner. Certain elements attempt to change the world as we know it. What is happening behind the scenes and can your party stop it before it's too late?&lt;br/&gt;And no matter what happens in Sin City, just remember...&lt;br/&gt;IT'S JUST BUSINESS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
