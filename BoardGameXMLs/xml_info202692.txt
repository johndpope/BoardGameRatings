			<description>The modestly named The Game, billed as &amp;quot;The Superior Game of chance &amp;amp; skill&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;more exciting than backgammon&amp;quot;, is played on a circular grid with numbered spaces. Players roll the dice and move pieces of their own as dictated by the results, trying to capture the pieces of other players. A player with no remaining pieces is out of the game, but until that happens, eliminated pieces can be brought back into the game by rolling doubles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
