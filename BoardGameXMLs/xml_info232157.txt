			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eight months ago, a visitor arrived from space: a glowing Baby, plummeting through the atmosphere, leaving a large crater in its wake. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t move, has no discernible sex, and does not openly communicate. It does speak to people in their dreams every so often &amp;ndash; strange instances of crystalline imagery and long-dead memories &amp;ndash; and, most importantly, it generates immense amounts of radiation that has blanketed the entire town. This radiation has had a curious effect: some people have gotten very sick, some people haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed anything, while some people have... changed, in ways subtle and overt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
