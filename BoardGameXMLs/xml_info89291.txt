			<description>Maze game published by the game store chain &amp;quot;Vedes&amp;quot; with a special mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player has 4 pawns in his corner and tries to get to the opposite corner with all his pawns. The board is just a square grid and you can move all your pawns as far as you like without crossing a black line. After this movement you can change the board. The black lines are printed on two clear plastic layers under the clear game board. You can move the clear plastic under the board in one of the four directions and make another movement with all your pawns.&lt;br/&gt;Opponent's pawns are blocking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
