			<description>Hamsters of Panama is new, original, simple but not stupid, funny but not childish, strategic but not too complicated board game. This board game allows players interact with each other, make strategies, harm fast runners or annoying talkers and many more. &lt;br/&gt;To win the game players have to play as many rounds as it takes to move 12 steps ahead to reach paradise Panama island. Those steps are divided in four different difficulty levels from the easiest one to the hardest one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round players get two special cards with certain features and take as many number cards as they think are enough for their playing strategy. After that players use special cards. Finally, results are calculated and players who meet level conditions move forward to Panama.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It should be mentioned that there is only one plane to Panama and many hamsters who want to be first, so don't be lazy, run fast, think hard, outsmart opponents and reach Panama island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join us and be prepared to survive the ultimate journey to Panama!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
