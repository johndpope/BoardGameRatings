							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Creature Dice</name>
									
			<description>In Creature Dice, players take on the role of a creature from myth and legend trying to gather victims and avoid the Monster Hunters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As each player rolls dice to hunt, other players may join the hunt and score based on the dice kept by the active player. Keeping all players engaged regardless of whose turn it is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will be dealt a monster card which shows the types of victims it can hunt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you will roll all eight custom dice. You are allowed to keep as many of these dice as you'd like, but you must keep at least one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your first hunt (roll) is safe. If you roll three hunters on this roll, you still score all victims of your type and your turn ends immediately. No other players may score on this first roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you roll fewer than 3 hunters, you may continue rolling all non-hunter dice you did not choose to hold. On this second roll and any subsequent rolls, other players score if you hold a die with their victim type on it. If at any time after your first roll you roll a total of three hunters, then your turn ends immediately and you score zero. All other players may still score on your roll, unless lock them out with a special die result that can ban them from collecting victims on your hunt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players' victim types overlap so that multiple players may score on the same die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last round begins when any player reaches the Victim (victory) Point goal (5 points per player) and the player with the most points at the end of this last round wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
