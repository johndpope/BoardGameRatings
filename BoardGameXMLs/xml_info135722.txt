			<description>Using the new Napoleonic version of the ACW operational March into Battle system from Corinth and Hampton Newsome's At All Hazards, this game portrays the the campaign that led to the first surrender of a French Army in the Napoleonic Wars and shook the myth of French invincibility.  The French army under General Dupont is trying to evacuate a huge treasure train from the sack of Cordoba back to Madrid when a Spanish army under Castanos appears on the scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a system that lets armies and units behave in historical fashion but makes it possible to play multi-day battles in a few hours, this is an army commander's view of how to conduct a campaign. Fatigue, morale, supply and command are as important as fighting prowess and sheer numbers. Units not just take physical losses but will become ineffective from fatigue and disorder long before they run out of men - unless you, in command, can manage them effectively and maintain their edge over days of marching and fighting.  Formations are normally activated by chitpulls, but for PBEM play a less interactive version is provided that still provides a significant advantage to the side that grabs the initiative in the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map scale: 1km per hex&lt;br/&gt;Unit scale: divisions, 1000 men per strength point&lt;br/&gt;Time scale: 3.5 hours per daylight turn, 8 hours per night turn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
