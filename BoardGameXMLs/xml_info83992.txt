			<description>user comment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is MicroQuest #5 in the Metagaming MicroQuests series of programmed adventures for Melee and Wizard.  It has a light science-fiction setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box (minus several spelling errors):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Jas N'orn was Cidri's most renowned collector of the weird and bizarre.  He had the most, yet wanted more....  Mnoren gates to a ruined Earth gave Jas his chance: nuclear genocide had rained down on the world's green hills.  Burrowing in the rubble, Jas' searchers found a functioning remnant. Its technology was strange and its secrets dangerous.  Jas knew he must have it.  Such was the way that the mystery and death of the Security Station came to Cidri's past.  With the Mnoren gone, it now kills on alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Security Station is a programmed fantasy adventure that can be played solitaire or by a group.  You become a treasure seeker in a menacing relic of Earth's atomic demise.  Great secrets and immense wealth await the brave invaders of this strange place.  Create and equip your character and with a group of hardy friends, you will step into the pulsating curtain of multi-colored lights.  There is no turning back, an adventure of fear and intrigue has begun.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
