							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eat Lead, Undead!</name>
									
			<description>The world has come to an end, and zombies, vampires and other horrors run rampant in the street. You and your group of survivors have one chance to get out alive. You've got to mow down hordes of oncoming undead and gather enough supplies to escape the city. Of course some of you might not make it out alive...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eat Lead, Undead! is a frantic game of dart gun mayhem! Each turn, players move their survivors amidst hordes of swarming undead, which lurk behind stand-up scenery. Players then all fire their dart guns as much as they can for thirty seconds to protect their survivor &amp;mdash; or perhaps wound a rival. Any survivor in a clear sector may gather equipment, while those who are wounded return home empty-handed. The first person to get the right combination of equipment escapes the city and wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eat Lead, Undead! combines elements of Run, Fight or Die and City of Horror with the unique dexterity mechanism of dart guns for a riotous and unique co-op/competitive experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
