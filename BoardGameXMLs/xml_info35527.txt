							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fishing To Go Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Players (the anglers) strategically cast their lures into a modular lake setup created from the lake deck, as created on the table, in an attempt to catch fish of high point or weight values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Different lures will catch fish species which are typically attracted to that lure in real life.  There are different sizes of each species, and each different point/weight class card includes different information about that species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The five point cards are new world records for that species, and include thorough information about the current world record for that species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are multiple options for play.  In tournament play, anglers can pursue victory by accumulation of points of by total weight, much like in actual tournament fishing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, specific species can be the target, i.e. largemouth bass, and all other fish would be returned to the lake when caught.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In point play, there are bonuses given for catching fish of three different species or all species in the lake, excluding the carp--which warrant penalties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If one angler acquires all eight cards of one point value a bonus is earned, but if that bonus is due to acquiring all of the world record fish (5 points), then they  are deemed the &amp;quot;Greatest Fisherman (or person) of All Time&amp;quot; and they automatically win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was commissioned by, and features a spectrum of lures which are manufactured by Sheldons' Inc., of the Mepps line of spinners and spoons.  These are photographed throughout by Doug Stamm of &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.stammphoto.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.stammphoto.com&lt;/a&gt;, a famed outdoors photographer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
