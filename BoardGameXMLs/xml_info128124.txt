							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Realm of Agennul</name>
									
			<description>The Realm of Agennul is an ever evolving board game where you control the fate of the characters and the future of the realms. Our goal is to create a fantasy world and outlet for participants to collaborate and decide how characters, realms, and the lore develop within the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players receive two characters, which must work together to earn the patronage of cities within Agennul. During the game players must protect those cities from invading players who are also competing for the control of the Realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use characters to navigate through the Realm and conquer cities to gain coin and control of Agennul. With the coin upgrade, increase your city's defenses by paying coin for a fortification or purchase equipment for your characters to increase their abilities. Engage in epic battles between players as ego's grow while the limited towns and cities are fought over. Be conniving and pay off players to avoid conflict in order to secure your advancement in the Realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Realm of Agennul is very simplistic at its core but can develop into a complicated strategic game as power shifts around the table between players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to have control of the most cities as well as the patronage of the Hero's City of Anos, is anointed as The Hero of Agennul and Protector of the Realms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
