			<description>Bricklayer - the Unofficial LEGO Portable RPG System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is built around LEGO figures and sets forming the character miniatures, scenes, and settings for the game.  The game assumes that any LEGO system can be mixed-and-matched with any other LEGO system.  The game uses the Portable RPG System, and the system itself is included in the rules, along with customization for LEGO gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the system have four Attributes:  Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Charisma.  Attributes have a numeric value ranging from 1-10, with 4-6 being typical.  Players can either randomly generate Ability values using 1d10 or perform a point distribution from a pool of 24 points.  Characters then select equipment which is derived from a typical LEGO set.  A magic system is provided in case the players want to use magic-themed LEGO sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
