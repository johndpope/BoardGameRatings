							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Color Quest</name>
									
			<description>Color Quest is a &amp;quot;magical strategy game for 2-3 players. Players travel the board using color, acquiring gold, gems and magical abilities.&amp;quot; This is &amp;quot;a computer-assisted board game, where room contents are preselected by computer, and hints progressively revealed to players... Once a player has 25,000 gold pieces, and at least 1 Power Square, they may attempt to win.&amp;quot; Other players may attempt to thwart the victory attempt and win themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All quotes are taken from the designer's website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
