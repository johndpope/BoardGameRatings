							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tumble Bumble Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;THEY TUMBLE DOWN, IT'S A FUNNY SIGHT&lt;br/&gt;TRYING TO FIND THE HOLE THAT'S RIGHT!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bumbles tumble down the slides onto the rink.  Over and over they go ... all going for the one open hole in the center.  PLOPP!!  You land in the hole and score!  Beware of the side holes, though, because if you land in them, you'll lose points.  First player to get a score of (10) wins this hilarious game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 13&amp;quot; plastic circular gameboard has a small knob at the center which is attached to an incomplete platform that can rotate beneath the playing surface.  There are four symmetrically positioned large holes in the central area of the playing surface; the underlying platform prevents any more than one of these from being open at any particular time.  There are four similarly sized holes towards the perimeter of the rink.  In each quadrant around the perimeter of the board there is an area for scoring and a small hole to secure individual bumble slides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns to spin the platform.  When the platform is spun, players attempt to land their bumble in the hole.  Bumbles are introduced into the rink from player's slides.  If a bumble successfully finds a central hole that is open, that player scores a point for the round.  Any bumbles landing in the holes located near the perimeter of the rink lose a point for their player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach ten points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
