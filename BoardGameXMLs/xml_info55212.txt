							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Settlements</name>
									
			<description>Two groups of people decide to settle the same valley and become neighbours. They start to build houses, farms and markets. Little by little building small towns that will become great cities. As it is human nature these two human groups start competing for having the wealthiest city, the most productive farms, amazing monuments and the mightiest army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you be a rich mogul or a powerful warlord? Will you do it by producing and selling or will your way be the way of the sword?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take control of a small settlement and develop it into a mighty city estate!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need a d10 die to be able to play this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
