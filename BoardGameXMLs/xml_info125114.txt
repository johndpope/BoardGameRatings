							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Orcs of Hermit&#039;s Island</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once again we return to the Hermit&amp;rsquo;s Island, last time we were there we explored the Cursed Catacombs below the old monastery. Now we turn north to The Orc Camp and find that they have quite a different life from their continental kin. These orcs have passed through the lands of the dead and lived, they have found a new faith and may have some of them even have a destiny.&lt;br/&gt;This issue touches on several other stories that have been told in earlier issues of Toys for the Sandbox. The cup of Folly first appeared in the Gambling Gryphon and more information on the orc druid war can be found in The Druids Grove.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
