			<description>If you are not familiar with the Bible Master card game, it is an easy to learn card game designed to challenge your knowledge of Scripture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players win verse cards by filling in the blanks with word cards like the ones below. Action cards keep the game challenging with wild cards, skips and more! The winner is the player with the most verse cards at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our first version &amp;ldquo;Salvation&amp;rdquo; includes Bible verses focused on the Gospel. As your family plays, you are reinforcing Scripture memory in a fun yet challenging way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 12 verse cards, 14 action cards and 28 word cards in the 54 card deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why the Salvation theme?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 Peter 3:15 says, &amp;quot;But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through testing the game play I learned that there are some Christians who have been Christians for years that don't know some of the foundational  scriptures used in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My goal is to help players of all ages be ready to share the hope of the Gospel by helping them memorize scriptures that will allow them to share their faith with confidence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initial production run will be in the King James version. Though others may be available in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
