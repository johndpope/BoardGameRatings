			<description>Take a completed Sudoku and what can you do with it...how about getting a little more use before tossing it into the recycle bin...Sudoku Recycled are a series of pencil and paper games that you can play using a completed Sudoku. Currently, there are 3 different games you can play and all you need is a pencil, a completed Sudoku and the rules to the game you want to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tic-Tac-Sudoku a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game for 2 players that brings Tic-Tac-Toe to a new level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Snakedoku a 2-4 player game where you try and make snakes (the longer the better), but your opponents will try and stop you by cutting in front of you with their own snake. This game also has the Mongoose variant and everyone knows snakes don&amp;rsquo;t like mongooses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sudoku Warriors a 2-3 player game where you place you warriors around villages to gain control of their resources. When a battle breaks out you will need the village's resources to win the battle for a Province. Win the required number of Provinces and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't have a completed Sudoku to play on...no problem just make a Pseudoku.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
