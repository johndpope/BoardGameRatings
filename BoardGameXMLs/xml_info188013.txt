							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Steal 2.0 Judge&#039;s Screen</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This bundle includes all of the additional resources needed to run Steal 2.0.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You should find various themed templates to play either Criminals, Police and Private Investigators. Also included is the generic second side of the theSpookEngine character sheet to help keep track of equipment and other issues. I've also recreated a classic version of Steal 1.0 character sheet for old time lags.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The character sheets have two spaces reserved for photos, one is for the placement of a company or force logo, the other is for the inclusion of a character portrait (criminals groups tend not to have logos, so I haven't included a second space there). You can find both police logos and character passport photos in theSpookEngine Controller's Screen bundle, the Brit-Ops Guide or source your own from the internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also present are the panels needed to construct a Judge's Screen (GM Screen), print out the following sections and apply to a solid sheet of cardboard and fold into a gatefold arrangement. You might also like to apply some plastic film to help strengthen and preserve the screen. The Combat, First Aid and Miscellaneous sections go on the inside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
