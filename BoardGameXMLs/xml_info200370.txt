They represent activities and places that give votes to players.

When it happens, players must negotiate which of the scene cards will be substituted by the new project. If necessary, they vote if each project is accepted or rejected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take cards of a deck and use them by turns for attacking, defend themselves and take new votes and cards.
