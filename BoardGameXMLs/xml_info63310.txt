			<description>Quer durch Deuschland translates literally as &amp;lsquo;Crossways through Germany&amp;rsquo;, reflecting the theme of the game - a cycling tour around cities and towns in Germany. Players take on the role of cyclists travelling across a board showing a network of prominent cities and towns in Germany. At the start, they are dealt out 5 destination city cards and the top card is revealed to indicate their first destination. Players then roll dice and move their tokens along the roads on the board that connect the cities. At its core, this is a roll-and-move game, where players have to roll two dice - one ordinary pipped six-sider and an action die, which shows symbols that affect play. The action die might give extra pips to speed up your travel, cause a flat tire and force you to miss a turn, allow you to switch destination cards with another player, roll the pipped die again and add to your original roll, and even cause everyone to transfer their whole stack of destination cards to the player on their left. The first player to visit all their destination cities wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
