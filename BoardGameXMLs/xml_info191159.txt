			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between) but IS already available for sale / early access, so CAN BE PLAYED.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything in the game is sandbox and non-liner; from the infiltration of dense urban areas to the exploration of the bleak, hallucinogenic landscapes. As with the originals, the manner of your approach is up to you: proceeding through pure stealth or as a violent assassin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This all has consequence &amp;ndash; the game world is entirely reactive. In homage to William Burroughs&amp;rsquo; cut-up technique, the world re-assembles and collapses based upon your actions. Where, when and how all determine the results of this, turning reality into a unique collage with every play through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
