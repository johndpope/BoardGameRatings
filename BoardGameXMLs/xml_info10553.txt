			<description>Rules:&lt;br/&gt;1. Take 2 counters each and toss to decide who is first to have THE RIGHT (explained in point 3).&lt;br/&gt;2. Both hold out 0, 1 or 2 counters in a closed fist.&lt;br/&gt;3. The player with THE RIGHT decides who will predict first the TOTAL number of counters held out by both players.  Both players cannot predict the same number.&lt;br/&gt;4. If the player with THE RIGHT is correct he scores the number he predicted and keeps THE RIGHT.  If the other player is correct he scores double the number predicted and wins THE RIGHT.&lt;br/&gt;5. A total of 0 counters held out scores 4 for the player with THE RIGHT or 8 for the other player, whichever is correct.&lt;br/&gt;6. If neither player is correct THE RIGHT passes to the other player.&lt;br/&gt;7. The first player to 25 or more wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All you need to play is 4 counters and pen and paper, but this game comes in a small tin box with nice weighty pewter counters and a neat pen and pad and an amusing fictional account of the game's history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
