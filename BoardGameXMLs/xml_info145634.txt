							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frantic 3</name>
									
			<description> User Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third installment of Frantic brings you even more aliens to destroy and even more bullets to dodge! There are now five ships to choose from: Scout, Tactician, Fighter, Bomber and Interceptor, all with their own unique capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shoot like hell, destroy as many enemy ships as you can and collect LOTS of coins to buy stronger weapons/upgrades. You will definitely need them in the upcoming stages and levels of ever increasing difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
