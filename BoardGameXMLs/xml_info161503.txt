			<description>From Sailor Boy to Admiral, A New Naval Game of Great Interest, was produced by C.W. Faulkner &amp;amp; Co. around 1900 and printed in Bavaria. The game was one of their &amp;quot;Upidee&amp;quot; series which featured cards laid out to form a track for a race game. The set includes 20 cards with numbered and beautifully illustrated slots, five standing figures of &amp;quot;Sailor boys&amp;quot;, bifold instructions, spinning die called a teetotum and box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by first laying out the cards in order to form a track. Each player chooses a sailor boy, paying five counters into the pool. Players spin the teetotum and place their sailor on that number, and continue to move him along the board based on the teetotum numbers thrown. When a player lands on a picture, they must follow certain rules, such as: 1 &amp;ndash; Enter the Royal Navy and join the training ship. Receives one counter from each player. 50 &amp;ndash; is tried by courtmartial on a charge of drunkenness on duty, and sentenced to lose five years seniority. Pays three counters into the pool and goes back to 39.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box measures 3 13/16&amp;quot; x 4 3/4&amp;quot; 1 1/4&amp;quot;. The cards (track) measure 3 5/8&amp;quot; x 2 1/8&amp;quot;. The sailor boys stand 2 1/2&amp;quot;. Teetotum measures 2&amp;quot; x 1&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
