			<description>Each player has three playing pieces and a car in his or her color. The playing pieces (a Sesame Street character) walk on the sidewalk, looking for a chance to cross the road to reach the inner part of the game board. For this, one has to cross a zebra crossing when no car is within three fields. The cars are moved with the same dice results as the playing pieces, but cover a longer distance (two fields per die point). The first player to get all three pieces to the inner area is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
