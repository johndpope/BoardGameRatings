			<description>subtitle:&lt;br/&gt;OGL20 Rules for Tabletop Fantasy Roleplaying Campaigns with Old School (B/X) Flare&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Microlite81 Public Playtest Version 1.00 is a complete, playable game with rules, spells, monsters, and treasure. It does assume a basic knowledge of D20 systems and fantasy rpgs in general, of course. However, the rules are very much a &amp;quot;rough draft&amp;quot; -- Microlite74 rewritten for B/X. Your input during playtesting will help shape the final game. As Microlite74 has had years of actual play, we already know the basic systems work well. What needs to be checked in playtest is that the changes made to the Microlite74 system both make the game more B/X like and work well (and don't break anything, of course).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
