							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mission Improbable: Obelisk Park</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Cold War, the government hid its experimental weapons labs in the heart of residential zones, so they would be more difficult targets for aerial bombing. Underneath Obelisk Park, a small dog park in the wealthiest neighborhood in the city, was a hidden high-security lab working on bio-toxins that would make enemies go crazy. After the Cold War ended, the lab was closed up and abandoned, its experiments put inside locked vaults. Hardly anyone remembered it was there, until the dogs started howling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About a week ago, visitors to the park started seeing their dogs act funny. They would get angry, bark and growl, and then break their leashes to run wild. &amp;ldquo;The pack&amp;rdquo; is now refusing to leave the park and defending their turf with tooth and claw, howling with rage. Scientists have visited the site and believe that the dogs drank contaminated water that had seeped up from one of the experiments in the lab below. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to get into the lab and stop the leak without being noticed by the rich, influential, and na&amp;iuml;ve residents of the neighborhood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character Creation&lt;br/&gt;Standard Risus character creation rules apply. No hooks or tales -- your agents are people of mystery, with nothing to tie them to anyone else and nothing to lose. Pumping clich&amp;eacute;s is allowed, but no double-pumps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters should be appropriate for the mission team. Some good clich&amp;eacute;s would be veterinarian, safe cracker, biologist, construction worker, master of disguise, politician, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At least one character, possibly more, should have a clich&amp;eacute; like &amp;ldquo;I planned for that&amp;rdquo;, to represent just how amazing the planning of such a team can be &amp;mdash; they can anticipate even the most bizarre plot twists. This clich&amp;eacute; can be used to come up with the proper response to an unexpected situation, such as &amp;ldquo;remembering&amp;rdquo; to have the right logo painted on the teamʼs van. By its nature, this is always an appropriate clich&amp;eacute;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Rules&lt;br/&gt;To better emulate a certain 60ʼs TV show, the adventure is to be run in two separate phases. During the planning phase, the characters are given all the known information about the situation and any maps the GM chooses to draw. They may do research or visit the park to make clich&amp;eacute; rolls against target numbers to discover the hidden information about the lab. The players should use this phase to plan &amp;ldquo;the job&amp;rdquo; in as much detail as they please.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the action phase, the team puts their plan into action. Any remaining hidden information will come out as the characters encounter it during the job. The GM should make sure that not everything goes off without a hitch, of course. If they made contingency plans or allowed for character communication, they may be able to change their plan on the fly... or not. Proper use of &amp;ldquo;I planned for that&amp;rdquo; should be able to handle problems caused by misunderstandings between the GM and players, like &amp;ldquo;I donʼt think I said there was a gazebo in the park&amp;rdquo;, as well as minor failures in planning. You can choose to play this phase for laughs (70ʼs style), for serious (90ʼs-00ʼs style), or both (60ʼs style), as fits your group best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
