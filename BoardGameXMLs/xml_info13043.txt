							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Laurel and Hardy Card Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a children's game of number matching and simple addition.  There are four suits (Green, Blue and Red each have cards numbered 2-10, and Yellow has cards numbered 2-5) but there are no rules for different suits, oddly enough.  There are also four &amp;quot;Lucky One&amp;quot; cards that don't belong to any suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you either match cards on the table (you start the game with three cards on the table) and so put them into your pile, or play a card that is the sum of two cards on the table and so put those cards into your pile, or add a card to the table.  At the end of the game, the player with the most cards in his/her pile gets 3 points; each Lucky One you collected gets you one point, and the Lucky Two and Lucky Ten are worth two points each (there are only one of each of these).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are illustrated with crudely drawn cartoon images of Laurel &amp;amp; Hardy, alas - photos would have made the game worthwhile for adults, at least as a collector's item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
