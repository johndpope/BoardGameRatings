							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Superman Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Simple &amp;quot;Pairs&amp;quot; card game featuring Superman characters from the 1966 era of the comics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules (From the Rules Card):&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the cards and deal one at a time until all the cards have been distributed.  (Players will not all have the same number of cards.)  Each player arranges his hand and lays down any pairs he has been dealt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player to the dealer's left begins by drawing a card from the dealer's hand.  If he can make a pair, he lays them down.  Play then moves clockwise, the player on the left taking a card from the player on his right.  The game continues until all the cards have been paired.  If a player has used all his cards he waits until his opponents have played all of theirs.  The first player to use all his cards receives a bonus of five points, but his pairs can still be captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the points on each card the scores are then added up and recorded.  The first player to reach a score of 50 or the player with the highest score over 50 is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Superman card has no value alone.  However, it can be used to (a) cancel out a pair of minus cards, (b) capture an opponents pair, (c) protect one of the player's own pairs.  It is placed on top of the pair it has captured, cancelled out, or protected from being captured.  Players must wait their turn before using a Superman card.  After playing the Superman card they also draw from the player on their right.  Once a Superman card is used it cannot be used again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
