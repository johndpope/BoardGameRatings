							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Capture the Mob</name>
									
			<description>Players take on the roles of FBI agents trying to capture mobsters, getting them off the street and into the federal penitentiary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Agents roll the dice and move around the board.  If they land on a mobster space, the mobster card is transferred to their penitentiary.  In addition, if the mobster had not been previously captured, you claim the reward money listed on the mobster card.  You can also nab mobsters by playing Capture cards from your hand.  Play continues until all mobsters have been jailed.  The agent with the most mobsters in the pen wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains:&lt;br/&gt;1 game board&lt;br/&gt;2 dice&lt;br/&gt;1 deck of 36 cards&lt;br/&gt;6 player packets&lt;br/&gt;6 agent playing pawns&lt;br/&gt;36 mobster cards&lt;br/&gt;18 capture cards&lt;br/&gt;6 cards numbered 1 through 6&lt;br/&gt;Treasury chips in three denominations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
