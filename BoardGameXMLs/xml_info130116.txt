							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The New Drug</name>
									
			<description>The same old thing, over and over and over again. The city's pretty used to the same old things looping again and again but something's is about to burst that bubble wide open. A new drug that just about to hit the streets. Something totally different and full of possibilities. Everyone's hearing different bits of information, but nobody's really had a chance to use it or even actually see it. Everyone's excited, either for a way out of their old habits, a new way to make money, or payback to the longstanding dealers. You're about to get in, but will you be able to get out?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the designer:&lt;br/&gt;I was thinking about a possible scenario for Fiasco, and I originally thought of a scenario about a new kid in town.&lt;br/&gt;After thinking about it a bit more, the idea of a new drug coming on the scene and everybody trying to get a piece of the action...&lt;br/&gt;So here it is, a nice little playset for Fiasco!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
