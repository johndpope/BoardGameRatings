							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arsenic &amp; Lies</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is 31 December 1919 and the party at Weatherby Manor is in full swing. The guests exchange furtive whispers of intrigue, blackmail and forbidden love. At midnight, a glass of poisoned champagne shatters, dropped from a dying hand. The family has to find &amp;ndash; or frame &amp;ndash; the killer before the police start looking too closely into their secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arsenic &amp;amp; Lies is a 3 hour larp for 5-10 players inspired by Downton Abbey and Agatha Christie novels. Rather than being a classical whodunnit, it focuses on the emotions, relationships and secrets of the characters involved: solving the murder might be less important to the characters than pursuing their clandestine affairs, arranging marriages of convenience or blackmailing their enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Infinitely replayable: the characters and relationships between them are based on randomly drawn cards and created by the players right before the game, which makes every run unique.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;- Requires no game master or preparation: just read the 2-page instructions and you're good to go.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;- Great introduction to larps, accessible to non-larpers and non-gamers; it has been successfully played by diverse groups of people aged 16+.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
