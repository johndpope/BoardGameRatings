			<description>Simple variation of a generic card game.  Extremely bright &amp;amp; colorful with amusing cartoon art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing board is dominated by a large circle divided into seven sectors (each of which represents a game character) with a centrally located plastic spinner.  There are 28 cards, four each of the seven zany characters that feature in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are dealt evenly among the players.  A turn consists of spinning the spinner and noting which of the seven characters it is pointing to.  The player must place between 1-4 cards in that character's section of the board.  Opponents then have the option of 'accepting' that the player has placed the correct cards or 'challenging' the active player, starting with the player to the left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If all opponents accept, the player's turn ends and the cards are left on the board.  If any opponent challenges, the cards just placed on the board are revealed.  If all are the appropriate character as spun and declared, the challenger must pick up all cards currently on the board.  If the player however is caught playing an incorrect card, they must place all the cards on the board in their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to successfully place all their cards on the board is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
