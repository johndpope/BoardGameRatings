			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the birth of the Roman Republic, and follow it through to its murderous end, a tumultuous ride through some of its most turbulent history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Rome encapsulates the dark and gritty past, allowing players to take part in the founding of Rome: as a bandit on the Tiber; to overthrow the tyrannical 7 Kings; conquer the rival Etruscan city states; watch the city be sacked by Gauls; battle Hannibal during the Punic Wars; take part in the malevolent Bacchanalian Consipracy; fight alongside Spartacus (or against him); or choose sides during the civil war between Caesar and Pompey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This invaluable book contains rules for everything from political standing to chariot racing, along with comprehensive Roman careers and guides for weapons, armour and Combat Styles of Rome&amp;rsquo;s legions and her enemies. Also included are obscure supernatural creatures and new magic systems to reflect the way magic works from the perspective of the Romans themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continuing the quality and historical depth of The Design Mechanism&amp;rsquo;s Mythic series, Mythic Rome stands as one of the very best historical roleplaying supplements, describing in intricate detail every aspect of everyday Roman life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book is packed with quotations from the historians and scholars of the last days of the Republic, revealing shocking details of Rome the Eternal City, a shining pinnacle of civilisation built on the grisly foundations of crime, superstition, war and treachery...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
