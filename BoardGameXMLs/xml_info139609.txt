							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Princess: the Hopeful</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Princess: The Hopeful is a game about the promises of our youth fulfilled, inspired by the &amp;ldquo;maho shoujo&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;magical girl&amp;rdquo; genre of Japanese anime and manga. Princes and Princesses are those who haven&amp;rsquo;t given in to that fear of inadequacy and failure. They come from a world unlike the World of Darkness, a better world, a kinder world, a just world. They come from the world we all wished we could make before we knew it was impossible &amp;ndash; and they seek to prove us wrong. A better world wasn&amp;rsquo;t impossible, and it still isn&amp;rsquo;t. As a Princess, power isn&amp;rsquo;t a gift to you, it&amp;rsquo;s a responsibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;This is a collaborative fan-created game for New World of Darkness.  The authors are members of RPG.net, but the publication itself carries no credits beyond a 'special thanks' section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
