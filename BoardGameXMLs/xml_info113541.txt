			<description>Tank Commander is a collectible card game covering tactical combat on the Eastern Front during WW2 designed by John Desch and Ulrich Blennemann and firsts published by Moments in History in 1996.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each deck contains 60 cards, a small 56 page rule book (don't gasp -- you can grasp play concepts in seconds). Two decks are the minimum required for play. Six decks maximize the experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card, designed by Beth Queman, represents a vehicle, (tank, half-track, armored car, truck) infantry or calvary squad, AT gun and crew, special equipment (like a Panzerfaust), terrain type and special events. There are a total of 164 different card types in 3 different levels of rarity. There's some minor card errata (nothing serious) and a list of all types on Web-Grognards. Each card has a color picture, short description, and different numbers representing game factors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
