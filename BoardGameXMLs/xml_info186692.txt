			<description>Pan for gold in this unique worker placement game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the town of Coloma! Players play the role of gold miners that have arrived in Coloma, Montana in 1848 upon hearing of the chance discovery of gold in the surrounding area. As one of the first prospectors to arrive you have a head start on the swarm of fortune seekers heading west and a great opportunity to become some of the biggest Gold Mining Tycoons in America!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the early stages of the game the players have no workers and must Placer Mine the rivers by themselves, panning for small deposits of gold. By the end of the game the players may have built a street of buildings in the town of Coloma funded by a successful gold mining operation in the mountains, employing a team of hopeful workers to produce dozens of gold bars and amassing a fortune!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What makes the game unique is the mechanic that allows players to simulate gold panning using the game box and the double sided 'Alluvium' chits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
