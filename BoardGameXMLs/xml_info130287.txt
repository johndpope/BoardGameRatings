							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bull&#039;s Eye: The Square Way to Success</name>
									
			<description>Bull's Eye is a simple roll-and-move played on a 7x7 grid printed on cardstock.  The cells are numbered 1-48 and the very center one is labelled &amp;quot;BULL'S EYE&amp;quot;.  Players use the included pawns and single die to race around the spiral to the center.  Four numbers have special instructions - lose a turn, go back four spaces, free throw and go ahead five spaces.  An exact roll is required to enter the winning space.  If one player arrives at a space that is already occupied, both players roll the die.  The player with the highest number advances his pawn the number of spaces rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
