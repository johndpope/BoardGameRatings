			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With your first set of adventures firmly under your belt you are relaxing and basking in the glory of a job well done. While at the local tavern imbibing in some well-earned spirits, a commotion can be heard outside. As you step outside the villagers are pampering two children who apparently just rode into town on a very sweaty and tired pony. An arrow is sticking out of the mount&amp;rsquo;s flank. As the animal is removed the townspeople pepper the children with questions as both are obviously afraid. It would appear the drinks will have to wait.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign; however it is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign! It was designed for a group of adventurers of 2nd - 4th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
