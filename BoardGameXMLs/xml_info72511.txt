			<description>&amp;quot;An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire is a 1997 first-person action computer role-playing game developed and published by Bethesda Softworks, set in the world of The Elder Scrolls.&lt;br/&gt;In Battlespire the player takes the role of an apprentice who on the day of his final test in the training facility of the Battlemages, called the Battlespire, discovers that an army of Daedra led by Mehrunes Dagon has invaded and killed nearly everyone. On top of that, your partner has been held captive by Mehrunes Dagon himself. Over the course of seven levels, you must travel through various realms of Oblivion to reach Mehrunes Dagon, defeat him and escape back to Tamriel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bethesda introduced a multiplayer feature that included a cooperative mode to follow the single player storyline online as well as a team-based versus mode to fight using all the same strategies from the single player. This was done through the Mplayer multiplayer network which is now GameSpy.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;An_Elder_Scrolls_Legend:_Battlespire,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
