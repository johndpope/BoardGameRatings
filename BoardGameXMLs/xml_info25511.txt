			<description>From the web site (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.stoneagescanners.com/golpe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.stoneagescanners.com/golpe&lt;/a&gt;) using Google's Portugese to English translation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Golpe (The Super Trunfo of the Brazilian Politicians) is a card game produced by the Stone Age Scanners based on 32 Brazilian politicians.  . With it you can start battles with your friends and learn more on these important figures.  It is provided for free to download, print and play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its creation deeply was inspired by the brilliant Super Trunfo de Santos Catholics. As well as this, its format is inspired in the Super &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; Trunfo - that, in turn (little people know) it searches inspiration in the Top Trumps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is available under the Creative Commons license.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
