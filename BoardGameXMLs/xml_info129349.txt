			<description>A car racing game through Finland for 2 to 6 players. Players start the race from Helsinki and must visit Rovaniemi, before heading back to Helsinki.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a route order card he must obey, when driving from control point to another control point. The game includes also chance cards for unexpected events that may slow down or advance his race. When a player gets back to Helsinki, he must drive additional acceleration and brake test before the race is over for him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player with least penalty points is a winner of the Suomi-Rally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
