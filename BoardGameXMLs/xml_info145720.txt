			<description>An official Pardoes game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;De villagers of Symbolica are in an uproar. All fairy tales are stolen from Pardoes' Star chamber, so now Pardoes has to travel across all six fairy tale lands to collect his fairy tales again. Of course the dark force who stole the fairy tales is after Pardoes as well. But Pardoes is a smart kid and confuses the dark force by duplicating himself while searching for the fairy tales. But only the real Pardoes can bring the fairy tales back to the Star chamber. Are you the real Pardoes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed and illustrated by Henny Knoet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of one main board with the Star chamber and six small boards; the fairy tale lands. On each board you find four different kind of spaces:&lt;br/&gt;- neutral spaces (nothing happens)&lt;br/&gt;- question marks: if you answer the question right, you may roll the dice again&lt;br/&gt;- Pardoes spaces: Solve a Pardoes task for example, move your pawn two spaces&lt;br/&gt;- Fairy tale points: If you answer the question right, you'll get a fairy tale card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the game is to collect three different fairy tale cards from three different fairy tale lands and deliver them to the Star chamber&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
