							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gomston, A Polluted City</name>
									
			<description>Designed as a classroom game which will teach children about the dangers of pollution. Players must make decisions relating to pollution spread or to pollution control. Best played in teams. The winning team would be the one with least pollution at the end of the game or lesson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Incredibly heavy, I cannot remember a board game that was as physically heavy as this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game even has a cassette tape and a roll of film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
