							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vehicle Design System (1.0)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CORPS VDS is a generic vehicle design tool for CORPS and other realistically grounded rpg's. This doesn't prevent VDS from having rules for magical power plants for science fiction topics, just that VDS treats everything in a logical, consistent fashion. For those of you familiar with our 3G3 product, it is about as complex (160 pages), with chapters for each type of vehicle subsection (power plant, power train, structure, etc.). We think it is the best vehicle design system out there, but since there are only a handful that we're aware of (GURPS&amp;reg; Vehicles, Fire Fusion and Steel 2&amp;trade;, Central Supply Catalog&amp;trade; and CORPS VDS), and we're biased to boot, take a look and make your own decision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fair warning: CORPS VDS is a number-crunching system for serious gearheads. It's not a &amp;quot;choose 1 from column A and 1 from column B&amp;quot; kind of system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
