							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strudel</name>
									
			<description>The game consists of two decks of cards and, for each player, a timer that acts like a chess or Scrabble clock. One deck is of five letter words, the other of seven letter words. The active player looks at the word at the top of a card that is drawn from the deck of his choice. The rest of the card is hidden. He then either (i) begins naming the word's anagrams that may be hidden on the card, or (ii) says &amp;quot;Strudel&amp;quot; if he believes the word has no anagrams. He tips his timer to its side when he is finished naming anagrams or when he says Strudel and then re-starts it on his next turn. Players advance on a score track for each anagram they name and for each correct Strudel. They are penalized for incorrect Strudels. The winner is the first to the end of the score track or the furthest along when the timers all have run out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
