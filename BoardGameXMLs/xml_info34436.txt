							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Carpet Bowls</name>
									
			<description>Carpet Bowls is an indoor version of Lawn Bowls.  The players take turns rolling their balls such that one of their balls is the closest to the Jack after all the balls have been rolled.    Hitting the other player's balls to move them further from the Jack is allowed, along with hitting the Jack itself.  The balls are specially weighted so that they will curve to the right or left depending on how you roll them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
