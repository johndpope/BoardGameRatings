			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The people of Arrowhill have long appeased the Serpent of Coldrun Woods with offerings and sacrifices so that their hunting could continue. The Serpent is terrifying and cruel, but predictable, and in return for their obedience it protects them from exterior threats. Recently, the Serpent&amp;rsquo;s demands have grown and her punishments have become more cruel. Little do the villagers know Mayor Crad Swayfellow sons imprisoned the Serpent, and he now uses the methods and reputation of the Serpent to control the populace through fear and tradition. Visitors to Arrowhill face a frightened, superstitious community and rumours of a dark, insatiable power dwelling in the woods. If they aid the village, they must confront not only the dangers of the Coldrun Woods, but Mayor Swayfellow&amp;rsquo;s attempts to thwart, and even murder, them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
