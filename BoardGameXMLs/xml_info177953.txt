			<description>Monster Buffet is a real-time, extremely fast paced, quick party game! Every players play a monster with endless hunger whose only purpose in life is to gorge itself full. Mostly on smaller, much less fortunate little critters! But alas, he is not the only one with empty belly and gaping maw. Other hungry monsters want their share too, and gosh, they are greedy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player grabs the token with one hand and puts it in his monster belly. Building and eating stack of critters, from one up to ten. You can take the lower number, same number or higher number, but never skip one in between! At the end of each round the app counts the points. The stack is worth the number of points equal to &amp;quot;meat&amp;quot; icon collected in it. In each round all players draw a random mutagen card. Each card offers them a task to fulfill to get extra points. Dare to get a run at them to tip the victory in your favor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
