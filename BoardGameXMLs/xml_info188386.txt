			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character creation begins with a concept and then the selection of Traits.  Instead of using pre-determined Traits, players select which Traits complement their character concept.  Sample Traits (which function somewhat like Attributes) include: Agile, Witty, Lithe, and Astute.  Traits need not be positive.  Players then allocate ten build points to purchase Background, each selection yielding certain benefits.  Backgrounds are divided by type, including: Social, Physical, or Skills.  One Skill is Talent which comes in a variety of abilities.  Perhaps the most powerful Background/Skill/Talent is Channeling which also is complex.  Characters may also have Nationality and Childhood Skills.  All characters then begin further development at age 14, and the player plots out a Career Path (this may not be completed, but will at least commence).  The last step in character creation is outfitting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action resolution is divided into different types:  Normal Test, Stress Test, or Opposed Test.  In all of these, the player rolls 1D20 and one or more D6.  The D6 roll &amp;quot;explodes&amp;quot; on a 6.  The summed D6 total either adds to, or subtracts from, the D20 roll for a final result which is compared to an action table.  Whether the D6 is a bonus or penalty is determined by the type of test and situational modifiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
