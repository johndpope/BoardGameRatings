			<description>In this game, one player plays as the policeman, while the others are thieves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The policeman attempts to keep the majority of the horses safe. The thieves each try to steal the most horses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a player rolls the die. Each thief moves 4 meeples into direction of the centre of the board, where one policeman is trying protecting horses by catching thieves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A '5' let you bring in a thief and you may roll again. As long as your meeple/thief stands on a white space it's invisible for the policeman; after your thief has reached the centre (field) he may try to lead one (of totally 8) horses down to your base. Unfortunately horses and thieves must be moved separatly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A caught thief is out of game, a caught horse will be moved back to the centre. Game ends after all horses are stolen or all thieves are caught.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
