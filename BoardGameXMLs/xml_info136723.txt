							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Acorn A30x0</name>
									
			<description>In 1992, a new range was produced, the first ARM macrocell: the ARM250 microprocessor, a single-chip design including an ARM3 chip without cache, and the IOC1 (Input Output Controller), VIDC1a (VIDeo and sound Controller) and MEMC1 (MEMory Controller) chips all integrated into one chip. The increase in clock frequency, from 8 MHz to 12 MHz, gave a performance of 7 MIPS. They run RISC OS 3.10. The A30x0 series had a one-piece design, similar to the A3000 but far smaller, while the A4000 looked like a slightly slimmer A5000. The A3010 model was intended to be a home computing machine, featuring a TV modulator and joystick ports, while the A3020 targeted the home office and educational markets, featuring a built-in 2.5&amp;quot; hard drive and a dedicated network interface socket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Acorn Archimedes&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
