			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game allows the player to take control of one of several of the characters from the Tenchu universe. The game is presented in a 3/4 top-down perspective. The single-player mode presents the gamer with 30 levels of increasing difficulty. These levels are primarily based on stealth/action. The rules for the levels vary between: stealth escape, killing all the enemies, or defeating a boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multi-player mode allows for up to 4 players and feels very similar to the classic Bomberman series. Each player lays down traps in a grid-like maze and tries to corner their opponent.The multi-player can be played either locally or via the network. The three modes are: Timed (highest score wins), Race (be the first to reach a set score), and Survival (one hit kills - be the last standing.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
