			<description>Marble Blast Gold is a 3D adventure game. It was pre-installed on some Apple Inc. computers like the iMac and iBook. It is also available for Windows operating systems as well as various Linux distributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic gameplay involves rolling a marble from the start pad to the end pad, while avoiding the hazards along the way. On some levels, there is a Qualify time that the player must meet in order to move on to the next level. Each level also has a gold time which requires tricks to defeat. Most levels also require collecting a set number of gems along the way. There are 100 levels in all, divided by difficulty: 24 beginner, 24 intermediate, and 52 advanced. If you beat all 100 levels, there you can create your own levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Marble Blast&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
