			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;SquareCells is a series of 36 logic puzzles where you attempt to discern whether each cell in a laid out grid are part of a pattern, using Right clicks to mark the cell as part of the pattern and left clicking to exclude a cell from the pattern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A series of rules are used where information about a column is given. This can be as either a number in brackets giving the player the knowledge of how many cells in the column are marked, but not the order, or a series of numbers e.g. 1 2 2 which indicates that the marked cells in a column are grouped as a single cell followed by two groups of paired cells. Additionally some cells within the grid will be numbered and that indicates how many cells form a connected group with that cell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
