			<description>Lapsus Calumni #08 - Timble's Treasures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Editorial blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Greetings,&lt;br/&gt;It has been far too long since the last issue of lapsus calumni was pushed out onto the unsuspecting internet. Unfortunately work has kept me very busy lately and I have little time to focus on the zine. In addition, being here in Iraq, I lack some of my normal tools I have at my disposal to help me produce the work as I had done for previous attempts. All previous issues had hand drawn maps that were inked and then scanned, but here I lack that ability. I recently downloaded a new app for my iPad called ArtStudio and realized this is just powerful enough for my silly little endeavors. ArtStudio, along with the Apple-made app called Pages, were used in creating this PDF ﬁle. Thus, I believe this is the ﬁrst, 100% completely made on an iPad zine (at least that I have done anyway). I consider this issue a test in concept, if it proves fruitful, I hope to continue creating the zine using my iPad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;This issue features some brief fantasy short fiction and a generic fantasy shop based on the fiction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
