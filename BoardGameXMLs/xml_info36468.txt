							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kill Gwen Stacy</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Card game for 2-4+ players. Gwen Stacy was Peter Parker&amp;rsquo;s true love. In order to jack up the sales of their funny books Marvel decided it was a good idea to kill her off. Sales did go up, as did fan outrage. Now heres a chance to redo comic book history but with a twist.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a custom deck of 52 cards. There are five types of cards: Method, Conspiracy, Location, Save, and Fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players attempt to play melds of cards of the same type. &lt;br/&gt;A player who is unable to play a meld on a turn must roll on the Event table and take the specified action. Once you have three melds in play (one each for Method, Conspiracy, and Location), you may make a die roll to see if you kill Gwen Stacy. If the roll is successful you win the game, otherwise you lose some or all of your melds and the game continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
