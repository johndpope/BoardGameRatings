							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends</name>
									
			<description>Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends is a racing video game developed by Slightly Mad Studios and published by Rombax Games under license from Atari. It is the eleventh and final game in the series. The game is a departure from the open world sandbox-gaming style seen on past Unlimited games from the series, and returns to arcade racing, just as left in Test Drive 6, and also resembling Le Mans 24 Hours, a Test Drive spin-off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development for the game began shortly after the release of Shift 2: Unleashed and uses the same engine to showcase &amp;quot;convincing physics models&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;one of a kind experience for all driving enthusiasts.&amp;quot; The main gameplay in the video game is driving simulation, although the developer claims it to be a balance between simulation and arcade racing. Ferrari Racing Legends does not feature car customization, as Ferrari didn't allow the developer to include the feature. It is the first Test Drive game to be developed by Slightly Mad Studios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ferrari Racing Legends focuses on Ferrari's history across almost all of the racing disciplines, including Formula One, rally racing, and GT. There are over 50 different Ferrari vehicles to drive, and each shows off full realistic interior and exterior models, as well as damage effects. The game is set to be released in celebration of the 65th anniversary of the first Ferrari ever built, the Ferrari 125 S of 1947.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Drive%3A_Ferrari_Racing_Legends Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
