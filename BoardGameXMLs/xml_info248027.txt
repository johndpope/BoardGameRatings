			<description>Cache Me If You Can! The Geocaching Card Game is a simpler, faster, and more portable version of the board game that was released in 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this 2 to 4 player game, players will take turns pressing their luck to collect as many points as possible. In order to take caches, you will need to have a coordinates card. Speciality caches will require specific equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will flip cards until -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Two Hazard cards appear (or the Bear)&lt;br/&gt;     An Equipment Card is taken&lt;br/&gt;     Caches are Collected&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unless the player busted, the cards that were not taken remain in play. The next player may choose to play off of those cards or discard them to start fresh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some cards will allow you to take specific actions, but those actions are explained on the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And... that's pretty much it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
