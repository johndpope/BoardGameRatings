			<description>Based on the books by children novelist Astrid Lindgren. The players play cards that are either &amp;quot;nice&amp;quot; cards, mischief cards, escape cards or &amp;quot;Emil's dad&amp;quot; cards. &amp;quot;Nice&amp;quot; cards are always played upside down, and mischief cards may be played upside down. Players wanting to know which must call the previous player, using an &amp;quot;Emil's dad&amp;quot; card. Discovered mischiefs gives the mischievous player wooden men (the ones Emil carves when he's being punished in the books). The player with the least wooden men at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the yellow box versions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: Game board, four playing pieces, six-sided die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are Emils and, as usual, are up to all kinds of mischief on a daily basis. They move on the board by rolling the die and if caught (landing on a red mischief space) they get grounded in the snickarboden (wood shed) in the center of the board, and have to carry on from there on their next turn. First to reach the finish wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
