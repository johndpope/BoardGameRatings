							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dynamiki</name>
									
			<description>Two states have declared war against each other.  You are appointed the Supreme Commander of one of the states.  Your forces: two armored, two mechanized, two airborne and five infantry divisions.  How will you save your country?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Age-old strategy and the principles and weapons of modern warfare are brought together in the exciting game of Dynamiki.  Based on the ancient Chinese game of Hsiangchi, Dynamiki reflects the concepts of some of history's most brilliant strategists.  Match your wits against your opponent's but be prepared: tricks, twists and surprises await you at every turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamiki is a modernized version of the age-old Chinese game of Hsiangchi whose original form is believed to be the world's earliest precursor of chess.  Historical documents showed that it existed in China as early as 2400 years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pieces are: the Headquarters (building), the Capital Garrison (guard shack), Periphral Garrison (pillbox), Armored Force (tank), Motorized Infantry (gun jeep), the Airborne (helicopter), and the Infantry (soldier on foot).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamiki also contains two other fast-paced, amusing Chinese games: Anki and Dakitzi, offering you a wide variety of game playing pleasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anki - Combines skill and chance in an exciting and unpredictable contest of elimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dakitzi - Somewhat like poker, but is more flexible and tricky, and moves much more faster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
