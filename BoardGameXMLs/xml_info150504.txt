							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Book of Kami</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meet the kami, powerful spiritual beings from Japanese mythology which are tied to the land, and have strange and mystical powers. This book introduces the kami subtype, as well as ten different kinds of these strange psuedo-elemental creatures which spend more time as spells than as monsters! Each kami is provided at three different CRs, representing the varied power of the creatures and allowing them to be easily included in any game. Also included are in-depth ecologies which provide DMs with numerous suggestions for how to use kami in their games, both as antagonists and as allies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
