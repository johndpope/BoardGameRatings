			<description>The goal in this card game is to climb up the career ladder to make as much money as possible. Each player is randomly assigned a profession at the start of the game; then a trick taking game is played in which each player holds six hidden cards plus some (depending on the number of players) cards which are drawn openly. The rank of the profession determines how players may talk to each others, mistakes are punished by penalty cards. After finishing a round, a player is demoted if s/he has more cards of the profession below him/her plus penalty cards. Promotions are then resolved as a result of demotions, and everybody gets their salary. The first player to own 100000 Euros is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
