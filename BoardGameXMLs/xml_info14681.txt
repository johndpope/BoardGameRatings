							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cities</name>
									
			<description>Cities is a simple, old rummy-style card game with a 54 card deck consisting of 3 cards sets of 18 cities.  The object of the game is to collect all three cards for a city--CHI/CA/GO, for example--which is scored based on the city's population.  (The game is from 1932, so Houston is half the size of Milwaukee!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card contains picture of a famous building and a brief factoid about the city--did you know that Pittsburgh has (had?) more viaducts than any city in the world?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
