			<description>Learn Phonics from a playful perspective! &lt;br/&gt; Consisting of 102 maps words, Sonodingo is a scalable game with 5 different levels. For each level, there is, for each card, a card that begins with the same syllable and a card that ends up the same syllable.&lt;br/&gt; Simple and traditional games as mistigri, Rummy, the battle... give a touch of fun to approach the phonology. &lt;br/&gt; Important step in the establishment of phonological awareness, and the process of learning to read, Sonodingo can be used from the large section of kindergarten for learning of phonetic syllables. In CP/CE1, we can also use the spelling of the words corresponding to the phonetic syllables to make understand the existence of different spellings for a phonetic syllable.&lt;br/&gt; A clever system of verification helps children to correct themselves. Parents and teachers will also appreciate the beautiful illustrations and the affordable price of Sonodingo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
