			<description>&amp;quot;Intact biotopes do not only offer plants and animals a chance to live and thrive - they are also immensely important for us humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this reason the players in BIOTOPIA decided to track down environment polluters and to become comitted with the preservation of biotopes. But to achieve this, everybody has to break one's way to the forest first...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game full of interaction and suspense.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his turn every player draws 2 path-tiles in the first round and 1 path-tile in each following round. With his path-tiles every player tries to build his path to the forest and to be the first to reach it.&lt;br/&gt;The player in turn always has 2 path-tiles, one of which he may add to his own path or uses it to sabotage the paths of his fellow players and to leave them behind as far as possible.&lt;br/&gt;A blocked path can be reopened by drawing an ecology-card and convincing a jury by giving examples from the players own experiences concerning the topic given on the card. A jury formed of the fellow players decides on the success of this actions.&lt;br/&gt;The jury also decides about success when the players try to convince polluters which they may meet during the course of the game and about the successes of preserving habitats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
