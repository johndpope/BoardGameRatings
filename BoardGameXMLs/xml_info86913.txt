							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MotoGP 09/10</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MotoGP 09/10 is a motorcycle racing game for the PS3 and Xbox 360. It is a title in the MotoGP series, and the second to be released by Capcom as the sole publisher. Players can choose from a number of motorcycles that were present in the 2009 GP season and race on a range of tracks from the Grand Prix circuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MotoGP features four game modes: Career, Championship, Arcade, and Online. Career mode is a comprehensive Grand Prix experience, and has the player compete in races and manage a circuit team off the racetrack. Engineers, team managers, and press officers can all be brought on board to further the player&amp;rsquo;s career, and performing high difficulty maneuvers can improve a player&amp;rsquo;s reputation. The player starts with a 125 cc bike, but as their career advances they progress to larger engines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Championship mode emulates the 2009 and 2010 MotoGP seasons. Players choose a motocycle and race on actual tracks from the circuit. As the 2010 season progresses downloadable content will be made available to expand the 2010 Championship race repertoire. Arcade mode is a callback to old arcade racing titles &amp;ndash; players must perform well in each race to complete the track before time expires. A number of well-performed actions will extend the timer, but crashes and other errors will result in time penalties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Online mode allows players to race against other to MotoGP players across the globe. Up to 20 bikes can be in a single race. MotoGP features split-screen capabilities to allow local competition between two racers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
