							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Best &#039;N Show</name>
									
			<description>Simulates the dog show circuit life.  Players roll a die and move, encountering various expenses and bonuses.  At several points, you may participate in regional Dog Shows, possibly acquiring points (the rules are rather sketchy).  Once you have 15 points, you may attempt to enter the Best Minster K.C. show in the center of the board, where you win the game if you correctly guess the [breed] Group which has won 'Best In Show'; if you do not win, you collect all the money on the board (how it gets there is not mentioned) and return to the circuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
