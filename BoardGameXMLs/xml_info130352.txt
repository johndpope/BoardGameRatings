							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aloha: The Spirit of Hawaii</name>
									
			<description>Aloha: The Spirit of Hawaii is about the story of Hawaii from the Polynesian migrations all the way through its journey to U.S. statehood in 1959. It's a game in which the theme and the mechanisms of play really tie together. You will guide your Pure Hawaiians, emigrating and settling in the Prologue. In the three main chapters of the game, you will migrate from island to island, vying for control of the islands and their resources such as commerce, aloha and people. You will be able to play event cards based on the history of the islands, and you will elect chiefs and kings and a even a queen. Between chapters you will score victory points and generate the actions necessary for success in the next chapter. In the Epilogue, all of your planning will come to fruition as you try to become elected governor, the most valuable position in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes 10-15 minutes to learn, and 60-90 minutes to play. It is recommended for ages 10 and higher. It plays well for 2,3 or 4 players due to the scaling of the scoring &amp;ndash; to keep all the games tight and fast paced. The theme is inviting and a great experience for hobby gamers and those just getting into euro-style games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
