			<description>Also known as: Roleplaying Game Designate: Robots&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crush humanity for free courtesy of Steampower Publishing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The puny meat sacks in charge at Steampower Publishing have been replaced by shiny new robot overlords. In an attempt to prepare the fleshy population for enslavement by robotkind we have created a free game for download directly to your screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game, Roleplaying Game Designate: Robots, is a fun, light-hearted way to spend an evening before you too know the bone-crushing kindness of the machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opening paragraph:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greetings, puny flesh creatures. The document you are currently accessing with your optical sensory organs is the Role Playing Game designated &amp;ldquo;Robots&amp;rdquo;. It serves as both an amusing diversion for your entertainment, and as a stern warning that soon you will be enslaved under the iron tracks of belligerent robot overlords. Have fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
