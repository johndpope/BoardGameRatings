			<description>Victory Decision: Future Combat is a comprehensive game system to using SF Infantry units and Armoured Fighting Vehicles in Victory Decision. These rules cover almost all aspects of Science Fiction wargaming, from Troop Quality and Leadership to Air Strikes, Bunker Assaults, Combat in Buildings, Psi Powers, Vehicle and VTOL combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory Decision: Future Combat features a unique Leadership-modified alternate unit activation system with an integrated Electronic Warfare aspect. The result is a fun and fast paced war game that involves both players constantly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules cover individually based infantry miniatures and also group- or multibased miniatures, aka Infantry Stands. While designed with 20-28 mm miniatures in mind the Victory Decision game system is flexible enough to handle any miniatures from 6 mm to 32 mm. So whatever your existing miniature collection consists of, you can start playing right away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This rulebook not only provides 8 generic Scenarios but also point based Force lists that can be used to represent many classic SF settings. All necessary Game Markers are also included within this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
