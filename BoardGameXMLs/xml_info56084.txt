							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Giant&#039;s Skull</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The large golden skull is smoothed and polished from centuries of handling. Legends say that its powers include the ability to alter the weather, throw lightning bolts, and smite your enemies with holy fire. You have spent years searching for it, following rumours and traces of myth, until you found it at last. It is the key to your future, the surest way to realise your dreams of power and influence. Yet even as you struggled to unlock its secrets, it was stolen from your possession -- taken from you by a bunch of thieving butchers and carried off to their lair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, you are not going to let them get away with it this time! Not when you were so close. Oh no! This time, you are going after it... and you are not coming back until you retrieve The Giant's Skull!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains two fantasy adventures. The first scenario is designed for four 10th-level characters. The second is for 5th-level ogres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn the tables on standard fantasy adventures! Not only can the players portray the heroes who must retrieve a valuable artifact from the brutish ogres living nearby, but a second scenario can unfold where the players take on the parts of the ogres, attempting to punish the human raiders once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
