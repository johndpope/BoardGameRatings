			<description>Vild med dyr ('Crazy about animals') is a Danish trivia gamed about animals for 2-4 player or teams. The payers/teams start at home in each their corner of the game board and have to correctly answer a question (of a self-selected category) in order to get out of the home and onto the game path. On turn each player (out of home) throws a die to move their animal-shaped marker around the board and has to answer questions in one of the five categories depending on the color of the board tile landed upon. A players may change direction on the board after each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four main categories are:&lt;br/&gt;Lilac: Soft and close (domestic animals) - in Danish: 'Bl&amp;oslash;d &amp;amp; N&amp;aelig;r (husdyr og landburgsdyr)' &lt;br/&gt;Blue: Beaks and fins (birds, fishes, and sea mammals) - in Danish: 'N&amp;aelig;b &amp;amp; Finner (fugle, fisk og havpattedyr)'&lt;br/&gt;Light brown: Vild and warm (wild life mammals) - in Danish: 'Vild &amp;amp; Varm (vildtlevende pattedyr)'&lt;br/&gt;Green: Creeping and crawling (insects, frogs, amphibians and reptiles) - in Danish: 'Kryb &amp;amp; Kravl (insekter, f&amp;oslash;er, padder og krybdyr)'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fifth additional joker category is:&lt;br/&gt;White: Fun and crazy (problems and challenges) - in Danish: 'Fis &amp;amp; Ballade (opgaver og udfordringer)'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players collect paws (plastic chips with a paw imprint) in the four main colors by correctly answering questions of the respective colors. The white category cover a variety of challenges to be fulfilled in a certain time (such as naming a certain number of animals starting with a particular letter, or drawing or acting a particular animal) or simply an order to transfer a certain number of paws to or from another player or the stock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player land on a tile occupied by another player, the other players is returned to home and have to start out again (keeping the paws collected so far).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player or team who first collect three paws of each color and get back home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content:&lt;br/&gt;Game board&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;4 animal-shaped game pieces&lt;br/&gt;48 paws - 12 in each main color&lt;br/&gt;1 die&lt;br/&gt;2 boxes with a total of 300 cards with 1500 questions and challenges&lt;br/&gt;4 pads of drawing paper&lt;br/&gt;4 pencils&lt;br/&gt;1 30-seconds hourglass&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
