			<description>Duelers is an action figure based collectible game where players amass exciting armies to battle their friends. Duelers miniatures stand two to three inches tall and represent a vast variety of genres and archetypes. Duelers are meant to be easy to pickup and play. Players can choose to play with two duelers or twenty; there is no minimum or maximum army counnt.  Like other miniatures games systems, Duelers is based on 6-sided dice to randomize combat. However, in addition to dice, Duelers utilizes &amp;quot;combat cards&amp;quot; to add an extra level of strategy to the game. Attack Cards can give you an extra edge in battle, and Defense Cards will cause your opponent's carefully laid plans of men (and mice) to go awry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to total enemy annihilation, players are vying for special game objectives in the form of Treasure Chests. Successfully defending your own chests is good, but capturing your opponent's chests is what separates the winners and the losers.  Gameplay proceeds as players alternate turns until one of three things happens. Either all of the Treasure Chests are captured, or all of a player&amp;rsquo;s Duelers are slain, or there&amp;rsquo;s an earthquake that shakes the pieces onto the floor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
