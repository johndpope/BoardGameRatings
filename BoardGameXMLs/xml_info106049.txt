			<description>Zwiffel includes rules for two games: Flaggenspiel and Zahlenspiel. It was published about 1992-1994 as a Volksbank promotional giveaway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Zahlenspiel players try to build ascending rows of 6 cards.&lt;br/&gt;The 32 cads are numbered from 1 to 32. The deck is shuffled and than each player is dealt 6 cards face down. Each player places his cards in front of him in a row with the face down. The rest of the cards go in the center to draw from. The starting player reveals the first card of the stack and chooses a card in front of him that he replaces with the drawn card face up. He than reveals the replaced card and gives it to his left neighbor. That player again chooses one of his cards to be replaced by the given card. &lt;br/&gt;The first player to form a row of six ascending numbers wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flaggenspiel is a regular game of Memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
