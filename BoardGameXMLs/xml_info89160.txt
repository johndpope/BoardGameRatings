			<description>Be the player who's secret mission card is closest to the mood marker after the character reaches the mood wheel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is a daemon that guides and influences the main character. The game is a struggle between daemons to control main character's spiritual state or his mood by using the environment surrounding the character. Daemons take turns playing cards to trigger the environment or some of it's aspects to shift the character's mood, advance the character to next section or to change the environment all together. Each player's actions directly affect decisions and strategy of the other players. Game ends when the main character jumps into the mood wheel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
