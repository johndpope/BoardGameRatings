			<description>A miniatures game set in the world of Eldritch Century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assemble a warband an face your opponents in the middle of a hostile environment, full of monsters and mishaps. Build a deck to overpower your opponents, earn victory points for completing secret objectives, and face your enemies on the battlefield in this fast-paced combat game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the dawn of the 20th century, The Great War between the world's superpowers broke out, leading to the emergence of humanity's most vicious side. Technologies such as tanks and combat airplanes razed the european landscape while chemical weapons were unleashed upon the youth that was fighting for their countries. In October 1918, the forces of the alliance and the entente reached a stalemate at the Argonne Forest, when a mysterious mist appeared. A whole american battalion immediately disappeared, it expanded across the Argonne line and consumed most of the american offensive. Attempts to explore the mist, dubbed the Miasma in search for survivors failed and rescuers either disappeared or were driven insane by what they witnessed within. In response to this, an international secret agency known as the Phalanx initiative was formed, with the purpose to assess the threat of Miasma and contain it before it consumes all of the Wounded Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
