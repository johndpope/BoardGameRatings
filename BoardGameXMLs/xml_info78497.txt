							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Formula 1 98</name>
									
			<description>Formula One is a series of computer and video games, and takes its name from the popular car racing of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jarno Trulli appears on the front cover of this edition, however some other versions have the 1998 World Champion, Mika H&amp;auml;kkinen, on the front cover. The British version of the front cover also has the ITV logo, the official broadcasters of F1 in the UK at the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the departure of Bizarre Creations, Psygnosis offered Reflections Interactive the chance to develop Formula 1 '98. However, they pulled out to make Driver. Visual Science were hired to make the game. As a result of this the game ended up being very poorly received by various gaming publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Formula 1 98,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
