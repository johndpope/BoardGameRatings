			<description>A high-pressure game of getting rid of a &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; potato so as not to be holding it when time runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game probably goes way back. Sidney Addy's Glossary of Sheffield Words describes a game in which &amp;quot;a number of people sit in a row, or in chairs round a parlor. A lighted taper is handed to the first, who says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jack's alive, and likely to live&lt;br/&gt;If he dies in your hand, you've a forfeit to give.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The one in whose hand the light expires has to pay the forfeit.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That was written in 1888.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apparently later it was played with an actual hot potato. Whoever ended up with the potato when the music stopped was kicked out and the potato elimination match continued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the 1950s, manufactured Hot Potato games were already on store shelves. Remco&amp;rsquo;s late 1950s version used small plastic pans for each player, covered up so that no one would know who was holding the real potato. In the 1960s, there was &amp;ldquo;Spudsie,&amp;rdquo; a wind-up potato who emitted a loud DING when time was up. In the 1980s, there was the battery-powered &amp;ldquo;Chip O&amp;rsquo;Grattin.&amp;rdquo; Most recently there is a battery-powered talking potato, which shouts out &amp;ldquo;Yahoo!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
