			<description>Judge Dredd: Dredd Vs. Death is a first-person shooter video game based on the Judge Dredd character from the 2000 AD comic series, developed by Rebellion Developments. It was released on October 17, 2003 in Europe and February 8, 2005 in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mega-City One is filled with 400 million people, each holding the potential for criminal activity. Judge Dredd is the city&amp;rsquo;s law enforcer, respected by all judges and feared by all crooks. The Psi Judges sense a horrible plague approaching the city, and the Dark Judges are their prime suspects. Later the release of viruses that change the host into a &amp;quot;Vampire&amp;quot; or a &amp;quot;Zombie&amp;quot; was then blamed on Dr. Icarus and Judge Death. Judge Dredd is then forced to fight the insane Dr. Icarus (who almost becomes immortal, his original plan was to find a way to become immortal, not make vampires) and the Dark Judges (Mortis, Fire, Death, Fear and Death again, in that order). The last time Dredd fought Death, Death uses Icarus's immortal body to fight Dredd, but is ultimately defeated and Death flees into Judge Anderson's body, whom had been held there against her will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Judge Dredd: Dredd is one of the most feared and respected Street Judges.&lt;br/&gt;Chief Judge Hershey: There is no higher position than Chief Judge in the Justice Department.&lt;br/&gt;Judge Anderson: A Psi judge who, captured by the Dark Judges, was used to open a vortex from Mega City to Dead World, allowing the Dark Judges to enter Mega City.&lt;br/&gt;Judge DeMarco&lt;br/&gt;Doctor Icarus: A mad scientist who created the strain of virus that turned infected people into Vampires and the Undead in his pursuit of immortality.&lt;br/&gt;The Dark Judges: Undead judges from a parallel universe.&lt;br/&gt;Necrus: The high priest of a cult of religious fanatics who worship the Dark Judges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Judges are only able to carry two weapons at a time. If a weapon is depleted of ammo, it is no longer usable and must be replaced by a newly picked up weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Judge Dredd: Dredd Vs.
