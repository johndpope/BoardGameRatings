							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Against the Cult of the Bat God</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder Roleplaying Game adventure for four 5th-level PCs by John Bennett&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lonely Coast&amp;rsquo;s most remote village, Oakhurst broods under the dark boughs of the Tangled Woods. Rumours of incest, murder and vile rites during the black of night surround its insular citizens. It is a place most wise people avoid as the very air seems inhospitable to strangers. Yet in the rumours is a grain of truth, for something dark does indeed stir in the shadow haunted trees and hunched homes of Oakhurst. An ancient evil, hungry with the thirst for blood, awakens from its eons long sleep. As disappearances mount and the Lonely Coast can no longer turn a blind eye to the blight that is Oakhurst, heroes are called upon to investigate the foul rumours and mysteries that plague the village. As the search for the truth intensifies, they may find themselves the next victims of a rising, bloodthirsty evil.  Can they survive Against the Cult of the Bat God?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although designed for The Lonely Coast, a free mini-campaign setting available from Raging Swan Press, Against the Cult of the Bat God is simple to insert into almost any GM's home campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
