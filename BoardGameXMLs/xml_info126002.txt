			<description>The game consists of a piece of clay, a timer and 50 cards with two words (one easier, one more difficult) printed on each of them. It's played in two teams who take turns in sculpting and guessing as many words as possible until the timer runs out. The team that first reaches 25 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
