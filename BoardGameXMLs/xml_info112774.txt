			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Hi all, here we are, and only about four months since Issue 7. Wow. At this rate we might be able to scrape Issue 9 in before the end of the year. Unless we find something more interesting to distract ourselves with of course, as generally happens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We're honoured this issue to have a piece by noted games designer and writer James Wallis. James gave us some very good advice back in our early days, and has continued to be a cheerful and enthusiastic supporter of roleplaying, despite various trials and tribulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've also got another notable contributor in Nick Pollotta, published author, and member of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA). We're not exactly sure who they are, but we understand it's a pretty flash bunch to belong to. Oh, and we've got a letter from Phil Masters, whose written so many roleplaying supplements that it would unbalance the page to list them here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, as well as Critical Miss, I write a column for the UK roleplaying magazine Valkyrie, and the first two columns are now up on the web. The first one was on the theme of roleplaying aliens ( Would You Let An Orc Babysit Your Baby?) while the second one was an untitled piece about conspiracy games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway, here's Issue 8. Hope you like it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
