							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bob&#039;s Full House</name>
									
			<description>Based on a very popular gameshow which was hosted by Bob Monkhouse. It ran from 1984 to 1990.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Box includes board, wipe off markers, 'Bingo' cards, golden card planner, Monkhouse mastercards, prize cards, general subject and special subjects question books, plus instruction leaflet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As players answer quiz questions correctly, they gradually complete their Bingo card. The objective is to be the first to do just that. Your Bingo numbers are marked off with a chinagraph pencil and they can easily be erased so that the cards are ready for the next game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bob Monkhouse (1928 - 2003) is pictured on the cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
