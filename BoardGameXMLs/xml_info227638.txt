							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guild Ball: Butcher Starter set</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Butchers&amp;rsquo; play style has been designed to be quite straightforward. They are masters of the mid to late game. They excel at damage output and generate a lot of momentum through combat and damage effects. They provide each other with a good assortment of buffs and debuffs in order to allow combo play. Butchers mainly focus on raw damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not to say that they don&amp;rsquo;t have some surprises up their sleeves - characters like Shank and Boiler can pop up and surprise you with their goal threats if you&amp;rsquo;re not careful &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Guild Ball match requires two teams and a ball. Play against the Butchers and you will find that the ball was really just decoration. The Butcher's Guild knows that there is more than one way to win a game; their intimate knowledge of anatomy developed over years in the slaughter yard is just as useful as the ball skills practiced by their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Ox, the Butcher's have one of the deadliest players ever to step onto a Guild Ball pitch. On his own he is responsible for crippling and killing more players than some teams manage over entire seasons. Always on the look out for young talent, Ox brings the apprentices Boiler and Brisket with him to show them just how the Butcher's play the game. They are the meanest, nastiest, most deadly trio to step onto a Guild Ball pitch in a long, long time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set provides you with all you need to start playing the Butcher's Guild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
