			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This role-playing game is made to pick up and play. It doesn't require a game master. You don't need any preparations. All you have to do is gather a group of 3-5 players, including yourself. The game takes about 2-3 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the group has gathered around a table, give this leaflet to the youngest player. He or she should read all the rules out loud. The reading is part of the game. Read calmly, and make sure you understand everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where there's a drawing of leaves you should follow the instructions given before you continue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
