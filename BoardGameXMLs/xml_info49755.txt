			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Got nothing prepared for thenext gaming session of Traveller?  Your players wandered off into deep space again, far from your planned adventure?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worry not, for 760 Patrons is here to rescue you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Packed full of adventure hooks and ideas, with multiple variations of each one, 760 Patrons is a veritable encyclopaedia of plots, missions, and paying jobs, each fully categorised and itemised as to your players' own capabilities.  From distraught merchants to calculating senators, from the worst of criminal lowlifes to the highest ranking military personnel, your players will never be looking for work!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original 76 Patrons became a lifeline for many Games Masters during Traveller campaigns, as it provided a ready source of adventure material that could be quickly generated when players started looking for work beyond their normal trading and exploration.  The all new 760 Patrons is literally ten times bigger and better, potentially allowing you to run a complete campaign with nothing but this and th main rulebook!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
