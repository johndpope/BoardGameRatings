			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Whole New Kind of Magic!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve played the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game for long, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard of &amp;ldquo;save or die&amp;rdquo; spells, and how entire encounters can quickly come to hinge on a single saving throw. Spellcasters simply point at a target, expend a spell slot, and either they cripple the target in one fell swoop, or they just wasted their turn. This all-or-nothing approach to magic has led to frustration for many players and GMs alike, and begs the question of whether there might not be a better way to handle effects like dominate person and major image.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents alternatives to the way that spells succeed or fail in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. A collection of over 200 brand new, never-before-seen spells, it features several new mechanics that explore other ways of resolving a spell&amp;rsquo;s effects, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Challenging spells, which require the caster to complete certain challenges before they can be cast, but have a powerful payoff for those willing and able to rise to the occasion.&lt;br/&gt;    Mental hit point spells, and new rules detailing mental hit points, which present an alternative to the usual &amp;ldquo;save or die&amp;rdquo; approach that most mind-affecting spells rely on.&lt;br/&gt;    Soluble spells, which have their own hit point totals, and can be interacted with in a variety of ways, allowing players to weaken and end their effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond these, there are over eighty individual spells not tied to any of the above mechanics, but dripping with flavor or designed to fill a specific niche in the rules, plus selections of feats and archetypes that tie specifically into the mechanics listed above, and advice on incorporating these new spells into your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
