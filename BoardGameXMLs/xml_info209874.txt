							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bait</name>
									
			<description>The Bait is a fun mobile game where the player tries to avoid fish attacks for as long as possible. The main character,Buffy the turtle, has lucked out and finds himself hanging from a rope about to be eaten by fish. To avoid the fish attacks, Buffy gets to swing the rope left or right but has to be careful so as not to run out of stamina. Fortunately, coins pop out of the sea from time to time and these can be used to improve Buffy's abilities such as his stamina regeneration or the number of fish attacks he can withstand. For some extra fun the player can visit the shop to buy new outfits for Buffy. Finally, the game features online leaderboards with Facebook integration so that the player can compete with the best players from around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
