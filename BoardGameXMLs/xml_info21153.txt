							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mickey Mouse Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The side of the card packet displays the name as the &amp;quot;Mickey Mouse Card Game&amp;quot; while the front cover displays the name as the &amp;quot;Mickey Mouse: Educational Card Game&amp;quot; and inside card instruction displays the name as the &amp;quot;Mickey Mouse Number Game&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the cards have either green circles that represent Mickey Mouse, red circles that represent Donald Duck, blue circles that represent Pluto, or yellow circles that represent Goofy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played with two to four players.  The four-player game can be played with a set of two partners.  The game begins with each player being dealt 4 cards.  Three cards are placed face up in the middle of a table, although the 3-player game requires five cards to be placed face up in the middle of the table instead of three.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can claim cards in three ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. By matching: A player can claim a card that matches on in his or her hand.&lt;br/&gt;2. By combining: If there is a Mickey Mouse &amp;quot;Lucky One&amp;quot; on the table, a player can form a +1 addition equation to place this card on another card already on the table and pick it up with a next highest number card in the player's hand.&lt;br/&gt;3. By building: A player can attempt to form an addition equation to pick up a set of cards.  For example: If there is a &amp;quot;3&amp;quot; on the table, a player can place a &amp;quot;4&amp;quot; on a &amp;quot;3&amp;quot; to build a &amp;quot;7&amp;quot;.  If player can use a &amp;quot;7&amp;quot; card next round to pick up the &amp;quot;4&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;3&amp;quot;.  However, this player could lose this &amp;quot;4 + 3&amp;quot; in two ways.  Another player could take this &amp;quot;4 + 3&amp;quot; before next turn by playing a &amp;quot;7&amp;quot;, or another player could attempt to build a higher number equation by placing another card on the &amp;quot;4 + 3&amp;quot; stack.  However, a player cannot build unless he or she has a card to pick up the stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player that cannot match, combine, or build must place one card on the table.  The player making the last play takes any cards left on the table.  A player gets 3 points for having the most cards, 2 points for a Lucky 2, 2 points for a Lucky 10, and 1 point for a Lucky 1.  The player or team that is the first to get 25 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
