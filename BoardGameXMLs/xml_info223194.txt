			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Door has been Opened, and the Fire Released! A New DCC Funnel!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Urisk are a curious race, cousins to the fey but preferring to gambol through the high mountain passes, barely interested in the life and squabbles of empires and gods&amp;hellip; which does not protect them from the struggles of dark forces!  Billy the urisk found Something Left Behind in the conflict between demon-gods and Elemental Lords, and it threatens to wreak fiery destruction on the lonely mountains above Morton&amp;rsquo;s Pass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a young and frisky urisk, and unafraid of fire, will you brave the dark passages of the fallen Temple of Krakaal and put things right, saving your people? Daniel Bishop&amp;rsquo;s AL 8: Fire in the Mountain from Purple Duck Games is a level-0 funnel for the exciting Dungeon Crawl Classics role-playing game, easily scalable for higher level adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what you get when you get hold of Fire in the Mountain; the backstory of the Temple of Krakaal, connecting the adventure to AL 6: Playing the Game, and AL 7: The Elemental Lords Awaken! both by Purple Duck Games, a 0-level funnel adventure in the depths of the corrupted Temple- that can easily be scaled for higher-level adventure, and provides for taking the players to any location you wish&amp;hellip; and a full-length section of playing the new DCC- compatible race of the Urisk, capricious fey goat-men of the high mountain passes! Great value for superior material, get your copy of Fire in the Mountain from the gregarious goat-men at Purple Duck Games, where our games are what you want!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
