							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Escape From Sneakius IV</name>
									
			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You drew the short straw on Space Ranger duty today - your Federation of Planets scout ship was assigned to Sneakius IV, the most dangerous planet in the entire universe.  And in keeping with your luck, your ship encountered a mysterious space storm and crashed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sneakius IV is crammed full of every kind of lethal predator and deadly parasite that you could imagine... and you'll have to use your imagination because no survey team has ever survived the onslaught of ravenous beasties to file a report.  Your only hope is to try to make it across unknown terrain past horrible monsters to an escape shuttle at the abandoned ecology survey station.  But if you're caught on the way, you'll end up as lunch.  So, tread carefully Space Ranger... and pray you don't taste too delicious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take on the role of characters moving from a crash site location to an abandoned ecology station using point to point movement.  The first player to reach the ecology station is the winner.  As players move their pawns through locations, they must roll a die to avoid detection by alien monsters represented by tokens.  If detected, they must fight.  Individual players use characters with individual strengths and weaknesses and player powers, helping them avoid or defeat monsters.  Each round, events on cards cause more monsters to spawn and regulate monster movement around the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Information&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is an entry to the contest Sneaky Sci Fi Game Design Contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
