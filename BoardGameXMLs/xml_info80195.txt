			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Runescape, according to the Guiness Book of Records, is the largest free-to-play MMORPG in the world, with over 10 million active accounts and 156 million registered accounts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is very open-ended, leaving the player with a huge choice of what to do.  As with most MMORPGs there are quests to complete, NPCs to battle, treasure to find, trade and sell, and a large number of minigames to play.  There is also player-vs-player combat, but this is entirely optional and avoidable if so desired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main focus for most players is levelling their character up.  There are 26 skills currently in the game (with a new one added roughly every 12 months) varying from combat related (attack, defence, range) to 'skill' related (woodcutting, mining, crafting, fletching).  As a player uses a skill (chopping down a tree, for example) then they will gain experience in that particular skill.  The higher a level a player has in a particular skill, the more he is able to do within that skill (cut 'better' trees in woodcutting); it also will unlock content, such as new areas to explore or quests to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
