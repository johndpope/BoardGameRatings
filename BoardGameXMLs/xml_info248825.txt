			<description>From the makers of Co-opoly: The Game of Cooperatives comes Loud &amp;amp; Proud, the fast-paced social justice word association game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is easy and quick. Players sit in a circle and flip over cards, if the symbol on your card matches another player&amp;rsquo;s, you face-off, and race to answer each others&amp;rsquo; card prompt first. Your card might say &amp;ldquo;Civil Rights Leader,&amp;rdquo; and their card might say &amp;ldquo;Renewable Energy&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;the first player to correctly answer the other player&amp;rsquo;s prompt (&amp;ldquo;Malcolm X!&amp;rdquo;) wins their card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But watch out: A few cards force all players to give an answer at once or provide not one, but three answers! What ensues is shouting, laughing, high-fives, and the opportunity for important conversations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is simple to learn, a blast to play over and over again, and refreshingly insightful. Along the way you&amp;rsquo;ll learn more about the many issues covered and get to know your fellow players better. Have fun, and no matter what, be loud and proud!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loud &amp;amp; Proud is ethically produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loud &amp;amp; Proud is great for:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fun time with friends and family&lt;br/&gt;Ice breakers for organizers and activists&lt;br/&gt;Community events&lt;br/&gt;Rallies and protests&lt;br/&gt;The game is small enough to be carried around in your pocket! If your pocket is located in a pair of cargo pants, that is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
