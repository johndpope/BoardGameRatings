			<description>Murder! Mystery! Mastermind! (M3) is a modern brain-twisting take on crime solving and the deduction boardgame genre. The game is divided into two phases: the Investigative Phase and the Trial Phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Investigative Phase, players scour the city as the Detective, Police, CSI or the Widow to find the evidence, motive and witness of the crime. Once these are pieced together, the clues will point to the location(s), where the crime was actually committed. In this phase, you will feel the drama and suspense of a crime-solving novel or TV drama series, where each clue that the players reveal will lead to more clues and a deeper understanding of the murder. Players can also learn clues from each other privately while using their unique occupational powers to the fullest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make matters even more intriguing, you suspect that one of the players is actually the Mastermind behind the murder. It's a mad rush to the murder trial, and the Mastermind is doing his or her best to confound the investigations, with an ability to lie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fifth player will play the reporter &amp;ndash; and true to form of the unrelenting paparazzi &amp;ndash; will ambush players at locations to query them or shadow players and learn what they learn. Their objective? Get the expos&amp;eacute; before the trial even commences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the trial, players will start presenting their accusations in court on what the murder evidence, motive, and witness are and where the crime was committed as well as the mastermind behind the murder. The trial will gradually build up to a scintillating climax where the player who has placed the most correct accusation tokens wins. However, if not enough of the case has been built up, the Mastermind will walk free. Will justice ultimately prevail? It's all in your hands &amp;ndash; or brain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
