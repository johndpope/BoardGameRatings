							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flagship: A Game of Naval Action</name>
									
			<description>A WWII era naval-themed game game of strategy for two players. The object is to attack and capture the opponents flagship with one of your submarines. The game setup and play is very similar to the later and more well known Stratego. Each player sets a &amp;quot;fleet&amp;quot; of 20 ships on the first three rows (24 spaces)of the 8x8 gridded board nearest its home base. Four spaces are left vacant. As in Stratego the placement/order of battle is hidden from the opponent. One side is chosen to go first and movement is one space in any unoccupied direction with alternating turns. Attacks are made when one piece moves to a vacant space directly in front of an opponent's piece and the rank/class of the ship is announced. The ship with the highest assigned value is the winner and the lesser piece is removed from the board. If both have the same value, they're both removed. One important difference is that each side is given 4 Submarines with the lowest assigned value of 1, but they take ALL pieces except the 4 Subchasers (value 2). Attacks need not be made when a piece moves into attack position. If no value is announced with the move, the piece acts a block to the opposing piece. The player whose Submarine attacks the opponents flagship first wins the game. If both flagships are removed through a draw attack, the game continues until one fleet is removed entirely from the board or the game may be called a draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fleet pieces/order of battle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 Flagship - value 10&lt;br/&gt;1 Battle Cruiser - value 8 &lt;br/&gt;2 Battleships - value 6&lt;br/&gt;2 Cruisers  - value 5&lt;br/&gt;3 Destroyers - value 4&lt;br/&gt;3 Torpedo Boats - value 3&lt;br/&gt;4 Subchasers - value 2&lt;br/&gt;4 Submarines - value 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;20 pieces in each fleet (red and blue). Pieces are made of wood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
