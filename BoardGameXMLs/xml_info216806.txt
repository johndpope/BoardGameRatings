			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HMS Leopard saw service during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, and was active in Europe, East Indies and Egypt. In 1807, a group of British sailors &amp;ndash; some of American birth &amp;ndash; deserted and joined the crew of USS Chesapeake. Captain Humphreys, commanding Leopard, requested permission to search for the deserters. Chesapeake&amp;rsquo;s captain refused, and Leopard opened fire, capturing the American ship. Humphreys took back four deserters and hanged the British&amp;ndash;born ones. This incident was one of several episodes that increased the tension between the British Empire and the United States, finally exploding in the War of 1812.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ship pack can also be used to represent the British Portland Class &amp;ldquo;HMS Leopard 1790.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ship pack contains a new ship with base, ship card, ship log, and specific deck of maneuver cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
