							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Valtyr Chronicles</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of Valtyr: a place filled with myth and magic, knights and rogues, and adventure to be found in wondrous landscapes born of imagination. Four Ages spanning more than 10,000 years have passed in Valtyr. Strange and fantastical races fill the land with ambition and their own unique cultures. Kings rule over vast kingdoms, some shattered and torn by the Great War, other practically untouched since the beginning of time. A magic fog called the Voss fills the air, and those with the courage  and the will to master it can work great spells. Gods fight against their own kind in the heavens above for the right to control the races of the world, and a holy order of monks performs the gods' will on the earth below. Everywhere you look, men, elves, dwarves and cerenoth love, fight, pray, study and die alongside each other for their own codes and ambitions. This is the world of Valtyr -- a world you are about to enter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Valtyr Chronicles is a role-playing game, which allows you and your friends to assume the roles of characters you create ... Get ready to strap on your swords, pray to your gods and channel up the Voss. Whether you hail from the icy forests of Fyron on a quest to find a lost artifact for the Tower Council of Argetur, or you are deep in the fog-drenched hills of Corval on a mission to save the easter reaches from Primordial raids, it is time for your travels in Valtyr to begin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
