							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Schoolgirl RPG: Complete Edition</name>
									
			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;School is in session!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re a perfectly ordinary schoolgirl at Sakuraba High. Well, ordinary apart from being a cyborg. And a catgirl. And insisting on carrying your Pyonkichi-san plush with you everywhere. Your best friend is normal too though. Apart from being a demon with an overactive imagination of course. You were having a pretty typical day at school. You know, a ninja attack during homeroom, then you found a secret treasure, then Freddie Mercury stopped by the school. Normal stuff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Schoolgirl RPG is a random comedy RPG about Japanese schoolgirls, based on the rules of Maid: The Role-Playing Game. To play you&amp;rsquo;ll need some paper, six-sided dice, and friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Complete Edition has the core rules and all three Schoolgirl RPG supplements between two covers. There are bonus character options for schoolgirls, additional random event tables, a random objects, random items, rules for rolling up teacher characters, and even the Otoko no Michi rules for playing schoolBOYS (albeit mostly delinquents). Hours of random weirdness await you for a modest price!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
