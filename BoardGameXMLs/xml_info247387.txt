							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Imperial Settlers: In-store Event Kit 2018 â€“ Trade Route Alternate Artwork Cards</name>
									
			<description>Portal Games created an 2018 event kit with promo-cards for each faction of the base game. If you participate in the event, you can keep the 3 promo-cards of the faction you've played with at the event. For each faction you get 3 copies of the same card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Japanese get a card called 'Trade route' and has an action: spend 1 apple to chose 1 enemy faction building and make a deal with it. Draw a card from your faction deck and place it face down under the enemy building to indicate the deal. As a deal it produces 1 star.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These cards are alternate artwork cards and replace the Trade Route cards found in Japanese's deck in the base game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
