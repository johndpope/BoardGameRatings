			<description>Initially the board is empty.  During the first phase the players alternately place one piece of their color onto the blue circle in any region, as long as the region does not border any other region already occupied by a friendly piece.  (Diagonally adjacent regions are acceptable.)  As soon as one player has no more legal moves, the second phase begins:  the players alternately place a piece onto the board in a space that is adjacent to one or more friendly pieces, and the friendly pieces adjacent to that space are removed.  The object is to be the first player to reduce to a single piece.&lt;br/&gt;There is also a short version, which means using only the light-colored section of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was published as part of &amp;quot;the Hi-Q collection&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
