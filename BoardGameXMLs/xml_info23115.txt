							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Murder at the Four Deuces 2</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the sequel to Murder at the Four Deuces. It is 5 years later and Don &amp;amp; MeMe Wannabe are hosting their annual New Years Eve Gala at their speakeasy The Four Deuces and you are invited to attend. The cream and not so cream of society will be there again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This murder mystery game is rated for Teen and Adult audiences. The murder takes place at the party. There are references to prohibition / booze. This game has no affairs, but there are so many sub-plots going on that it has all the excitement of the first game. There is also no prostitute, madam or house of ill repute referenced in this version. They were not needed to bring the game forward 5 years. This is actually a pretty clean game that still manages to be very exciting in spite of it:-) It is filled with twists and turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Murder At The Four Deuces 2 is the sequel to our very popular Murder at the Four Deuces. It takes place 5 years later at a New Years Eve Party and has most of the original characters returning, along with a few new ones. You are not required to have played the original game to play this one, but I highly recommend doing so, as it does add a depth to the game. Guests who have played before will have a greater understanding of the characters, motives and backgrounds. If guests are playing the same character as previously played they will really have a blast with their matured character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's New Years Eve 1924 and Don &amp;amp; MeMe Wannabe are hosting their annual New Years Eve Bash at their speakeasy The Four Deuces and you are invited to attend. The Four Deuces is a lavish joint. The cream and not so cream of society will be here. With gangsters, hit men, politicians, opera singers, molls and many other interesting guests in attendance there are sure to be a lot of big deals being made here tonight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.dinnerandamurder.com/games/4deuces2.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.dinnerandamurder.com/games/4deuces2.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
