			<description>When the dastardly Boss Grimshaw swindles the innocent townspeople of their gold to fund his railroad, a lone hero emerges: Incendio. Inspired by the tale of Robin Hood, Incendio sets out to make Grimshaw pay through the nose. Armed with their wits and a keg of gunpowder, players must help Incendio liberate the town's stolen gold by blasting Grimshaw's safes and piggy banks sky high through a series of carefully choreographed chained explosions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gunpowder is a one of a kind physics-based puzzle game featuring colorful artwork, a charming backstory and clever game design that is sure to appeal to gamers of all ages. With a simple swipe of the finger, Gunpowder is easy to pick up but offers ever-increasing challenges through thought-provoking brainteasers, immersive physics-based gameplay elements and the use of numerous environmental objects - flaming wagons, Gatling guns, chandeliers, cannons, mine carts and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 125 unique levels, timed trials, numerous Easter eggs, unlockable achievements and the ability to compete against friends, Gunpowder can be played many times over, as players seek to find the fastest and best way to solve each puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
