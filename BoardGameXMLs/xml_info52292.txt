			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When your ire has been raised, when you have been wronged, when someone has crossed you too many times -- it's time to contact the Council of Wrath. This small but extremely efficient band specializes in vengeance. And woe to those who find them looking in their direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Council of Wrath is an organization of mercenaries that fulfils a need: revenge. Mainly made up of assassins, the Council will do whatever it is hired to do to get revenge for a wronged party. This includes blackmail, public humiliation, destruction of property, and other illegal activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Eye for an Eye, August's free online mini-module by Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil designer Monte Cook pits your 8th-level characters against these dangerous ruffians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario can take place in any campaign. You don't even need hooks to get the PCs into this adventure: It comes to them. What group of heroes, by the time they have reached 8th level, has not incurred the wrath of someone powerful or wealthy enough to hire the Council of Wrath to eliminate them? Whether it is the angry wizard whose tower the PCs broke into, or the orc king incensed after they sacked his fortress, somebody, somewhere wants the PCs dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Council of Wrath is up to the task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Comment&lt;br/&gt;Not to be mistaken for An Eye for an Eye&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
