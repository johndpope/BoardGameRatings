							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bird Feeder Frenzy</name>
									
			<description>A very casual deduction and bluffing game for 2 to 6 bird lovers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re just another bird plotting to get the biggest share of seeds from the neighborhood feeders with the most seeds and fewest other birds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Feeders&amp;quot; are several rows of cards in the middle of the table with some face-up and some face-down cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players add one card at one of the feeders, with an option to first peek at a face-down card. If the player peeks, they play their card face-up. Once all cards are played, all is revealed, critters steal their seeds, and the birds share what&amp;rsquo;s left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 18-card micro-game gives players a limited amount of information along with a few ways to learn more about and impact what is available at each of the feeders. A little deduction will place your bird in the most advantageous spot, and a little bluffing will coax others&amp;rsquo; birds to miss the big haul.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
