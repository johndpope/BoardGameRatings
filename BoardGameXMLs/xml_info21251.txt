							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Colony: A Strategy Game</name>
									
			<description>Colony A Strategy Game is a strategic conflict and colony building game.  Small counters represent warships and townships, which are deployed on the main map.  Status sheets record the condition of the ships and status of the construction of the colony.&lt;br/&gt;Colony building along with conflict takes place on the same turn, so decisions need to be made to balance advancing victory conditions versus elimination of opponent's assets.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first to build an entire colony, which consists of nine CM's being built.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
