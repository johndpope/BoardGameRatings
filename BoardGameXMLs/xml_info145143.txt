							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Torchbearer</name>
									
			<description>From the Kickstarter page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Torchbearer is a riff on the early model of fantasy role-playing games. In it, you take on the role of an adventurer seeking his or her fortune. To earn that fortune, you must explore forlorn ruins, brave terrible monsters and retrieve forgotten treasures. However, this game is not about being a hero. It is not about fighting for what you believe. This game is about exploration and survival. You may become a hero. You might have to fight for your ideals. But to do either of those things, you must prove yourself in the wilds. Because there are no jobs, no inheritance, no other opportunities for our deadbeat adventurers. This life is their only hope to prosper in this world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Torchbearer is part of the brand of games Burning Wheel HQ has been producing for over ten years. So like all of our other games, this is a game about making difficult choices while exploring the world and your character through the game rules and systems. And like all of our games, the heart of the experience is about how your character changes when faced with adversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a hard game, not a simple one. There are many moving parts and it&amp;rsquo;s not possible to experience the whole game in one or even two sessions. But if you&amp;rsquo;re ready to sink your teeth into a good game that will reward you for mastering the system over 10 or 20 sessions, this is the game for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
