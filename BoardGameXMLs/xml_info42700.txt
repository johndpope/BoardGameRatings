			<description>The Glory That Was is a series of games depicting several different battles from the ancient world.&lt;br/&gt;Volume I, Greece, depicts a number of battles from the Persian War to the War of the Successors, while volume II, Rome, will have different battles from the Early Republic to the Late Roman Empire.&lt;br/&gt;After the Peloponnesian War, for around three decades Sparta was the uncontested military leader of the greek poleis, and considered almost invincible in an open field battle, for the strenght, the discipline and the courage of her hoplites.&lt;br/&gt;The battles depicted in this &amp;ldquo;episode&amp;rdquo; of our descent into the realm of the &amp;ldquo;Glory that was Greece&amp;rdquo;, both from 394 BC, testify the truth of this assertion, being both Spartan victories against coalitions of forces taken by several other Greek cities-states.&lt;br/&gt;Map scale will be variable, depending on the battle depicted, while each unit will normally represents from 100 to 1.000 infantry and from 25 to 250 cavalry or missile units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains:&lt;br/&gt;2 8.5x11&amp;quot; full color maps&lt;br/&gt;138 counters and markers&lt;br/&gt;14 Cards&lt;br/&gt;10 Page Rules in English&lt;br/&gt;1 Morale Chart&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
