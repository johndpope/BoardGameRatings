							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hit List</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;It's taken four years to develop an idea into Hit List - the most exciting new game in Australia in years!&amp;quot; the advertising blurb claims.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It contains 112 cards, lots of money and a few playing mats. The mats are only as a guide for learning, showing you how to build sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme is &amp;quot;elimination&amp;quot;. You have to build contracts from sets of compatible cards. At the very least, a Victim and Means card are required to open a contract. The contract can then grow by playing in order: Scene and Hit cards of the same suit as the Means card (which there are seven suits - Strangulation, Poisoning, Drowning, Torture, Shooting, Starving and Hit &amp;amp; Run). Thereafter, you can optionally play a Disposal, then an Alibi card on the sequence Means, Scene, &amp;amp; Hit that you've built up. You can play a motive card on top (at any time on an open contract) - which must be of the same suit as the victim (there are eight suits - Royalty, Union Leader, Movie Star, Pet, Politician, Business Person, Religious Leader and &amp;quot;Choose your own victim&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to earn the most money, and money is earned by closing contracts. To score, a contract must contain a Victim, Means, Scene and Hit card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
