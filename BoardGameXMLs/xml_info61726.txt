							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gooseberry Fool</name>
									
			<description>The winner of this eccentric trickster is awarded one or more Golden Geese. Agree beforehand what one Golden Goose is worth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Always played at three Gooseberry Fool is a trick taking game where the winner is always the odd man out. When playing cards of the same suit (which is required if possible) the middle card wins, when two suits are played, the odd one wins and if multiple suits are played, the one with the odd color takes the trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet points are scored based on tricks won, where you get 1 point for each trick you win, yet 2 for each trick won by the player on your right. Also, the goal is to be the one in the middle when one player reaches 100 points. Thus at the end if the scores are 100, 82, 67; the player with 82 would be declared the winner (in case of a tie, the untied player wins).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
