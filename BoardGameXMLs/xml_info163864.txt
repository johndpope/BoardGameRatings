							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Turkey To Go</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as a plucked turkey grabbing feathers. This is a fixed screen game. Feathers and corn fall from the top of the screen and forks come from the bottom. Try to grab the requisite number of feathers in the time limit. A fork will stick in you and fix you in place for a set amount of time. The corn offers various bonus effects such as growing larger to help grab feathers, slowing time down for the feathers corn and fork, increasing the speed the turkey moves and more. Each level is successively more difficult than the prior. Remaining time is carried over to next level as an incentive for skilled play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
