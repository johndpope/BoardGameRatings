			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;Two people or a carload take the Olympic Trivia challenge. Test your knowledge by competing head-to-head with family and friends.  Learn how the Olympic Movement inspires everyone around the world in friendly competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;In Travel Olympic Challenge, players take turns choosing a category of Olympic trivia (such as countries or events). The player must then choose to try for a bronze, silver or gold medal. The player is then read a question by another player. If trying for gold, the player must answer with no hints. For silver, the player must choose an answer from three choices. For bronze, only two choices are offered. A correct question wins the medal, which is marked on a scorecard. A player's turn ends after a correct or incorrect answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On subsequent turns, players may upgrade medals already won by answering another question from the same level already won (e.g. a second silver medal in a category upgrades the player to gold in that category). The first player to win a gold medal in all five categories wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To shorten the game, it may be played with a certain number of rounds or a time limit. In this case, gold, silver and bronze medals score 3, 2 and 1 points, respectively. The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
