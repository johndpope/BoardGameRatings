							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The City of Ravenclaw: The Sewers of Ravenclaw</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rumors of things lurking in the sewers are running rampant throughout the city. Moaning can be heard in the dark hours before dawn eminating from the sewer drains. An agent of the Eight approach the characters and ask them to investigate. The reward is very large but they wouldn't pay so much if it were safe. What or who is creating the zombies? Can the party find out before the city is overrun with undead?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pdf provides a brief description of the Sewers and a map with room by room descriptions. This is a dungeon crawl against a horde of zombies and other sewer dwellers for a party of 4-6 5th level characters. The Adventure is suitable for any fantasy campaign but is uses monsters and NPCs from Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
