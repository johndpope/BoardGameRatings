			<description>Football Manager 2012 allows you to take control of any club in over 50 nations across the world, including all of the biggest leagues across Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're in the hot-seat, which means you decide who plays and who sits on the bench, you're in total control of tactics, team-talks, substitutions and pitch-side instructions as you follow the match live with the acclaimed 3D match engine allowing YOU to make the difference!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the boss you'll also have full control of team affairs away from the pitch:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Will you spend big-money on expensive superstars or put a focus on scouting for wonderkids ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- How will you approach training &amp;amp; match preparation ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Will you be the chairman's best friend or always demand the best investment from the board ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- How do you react when a young star has problems - a shoulder to cry on or a clip round the ear ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- And how will you deal with tricky questions from the media ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now it's time to put your opinions to the test.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
