While they are constrained by the many rules imposed by their imprisonment, they can still use their demigod like powers to alter the destiny of the world in many ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Summon Mystic&lt;br/&gt; Level 40 version&lt;br/&gt; Att: 3 | Dam: 1 | Def: 9 | Arm: 0 | LP: 13 | Res: 11 | Mov: 6/10 | AP 3/4&lt;br/&gt; Cost to Summon: oo Affinity: Dark&lt;br/&gt; Atman: 60 | **Bind: 1 | Stability: 8 | Shock: +3&lt;br/&gt; Innate Abilities: Flight, Intangible&lt;br/&gt; Truncation of Fate: Enemy units of level 40 or below in Al-Djinn's control zone can not use Gnosis points.&lt;br/&gt; o - Absolute Change (Magic, Effect):&lt;br/&gt; The Al-Djinn becomes a copy of any other level 50 or lower unit in play.
