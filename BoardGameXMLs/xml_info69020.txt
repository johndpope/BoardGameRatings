			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Grand Theft Auto&amp;quot;, developed by DMA Design &amp;amp; published by BMG, arguably spawned the modern genre of sandbox games with its &amp;quot;living breathing city&amp;quot;. The player, a petty criminal at the beginning of the game, is presented with immense freedom &amp;amp; a toybox of tools to complete a series of missions given to him by local mafia gangs. Played from a top down perspective, the player can steal cars, mug pedestrians and generally cause chaos throughout a city. The city reacts to the player's actions; fires cause fire engines to reacts, ambulances come out to pick up the dead &amp;amp; injured, committing crimes causes the police to chase after the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broken into three chapters, each inspired by American cities, the player has a score-based challenge to reach to complete each level. Players can earn points by committing crimes, completing the story missions, or by completing various side-missions (e.g. stealing different types of cars, completing rampage missions etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GTA was notably a critical &amp;amp; commercial success in Europe but a flop in North America. In North America, its top down perspective &amp;amp; sprite-based graphics were viewed as old-fashioned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
