							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Championship Drag Racing: Top Fuel Edition</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;After years of trying, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally arrived at a final product in which I&amp;rsquo;m extremely happy, and I think captures the sport as best as possible. And while rolling a game of Championship Drag Racing will take a bit longer than a 4.5 second Elapsed Time, I really think the flow of the game is done very well. The average gamer should easily be able to knock out an event in a single sitting while experiencing all of the drama and excitement of a real-life drag racing event.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Anything that can happen in a real life drag racing event; can and will happen with the same frequency in Championship Drag Racing. Drivers will red-light, have tremendous reaction times, blow up their engines, and even crash with the same frequency as the year represented. And as with any replay game that is worth its salt there are allowances made within the confines of realistic frequency for ANYTHING to truly happen.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In general, your results will be very close to the on-the-track action of the season represented. However, keep in mind, that this game simulates hundreds of variables that can occur in any race. As with any sport, sometimes pure luck can be the deciding factor. That&amp;rsquo;s no exception with Championship Drag Racing. On the whole, you&amp;rsquo;ll experience very realistic results. But, within the confines of a single qualifying run or elimination race, anything can truly happen!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Championship Drag Racing: Top Fuel Edition gives you every Top Fuel Racer that made a successful qualifying attempt in 2005. You also get all 23 circuits rated by lane making the lane choice strategy just as important as real life. A full schedule, complete points standings, complete final ladders for each event, as well as a list of drivers that attempted to make every field are included.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The standard game is printed in black and white. The Deluxe edition of the game is printed in full color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
