			<description>George Washington and Abraham Lincoln are two of the most renowned figures in American history, but who would make a better President in 2016? In 1860? In 1792? Let the voters decide! Election! is an interactive family board game with a focus on America&amp;rsquo;s greatest leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a player, you have been granted the power to manage a political party that is desperate for control of the White House. In addition to selecting candidates, you may also take advantage of external factors to influence the election in your party's favor. Should you stay positive by gaining the support of a popular activist or attempt to smear an opponent's image by revealing a scandal? Do you take the high road and try to win ethically or attempt to sabotage your opponents through dirty politics? Should you throw in the towel or demand a recount? Votes are all that matters as you navigate your way to the White House.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Determine the Election Year: Each round, randomly select an Election Year card that lists the most important issues of that time in American history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Party Nominations: Each player selects 1 of the 5 Presidential Candidate cards from their hand.  Players nominate a candidate based on ratings that show the card&amp;rsquo;s overall polling strength of the issues being discussed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Roll Dice to Determine Votes: Custom dice are rolled based on a candidate's rating. The rating corresponds to the important issues set on the Election Year card. Higher ratings often result in more votes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonus) Red Tape and Public Opinion cards are wild cards that have the power to impact an election (for better or worse).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) The player with the most votes wins the election and advances along the game board.  The winner is the first player to advance to the White House space at the end of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After winning a series of elections with shrewd strategy and a bit of luck, the player who first advances to the White House space on the board wins the game and earns the right to be called Mr. or Mrs. President!  Mudslinging and dirty politics guaranteed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
