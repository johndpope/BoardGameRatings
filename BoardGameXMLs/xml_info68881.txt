			<description>This is a boardgame published by the magazine Woman. It is a race game with help and hindrance along the way. It also reflects the fact that women were very much involved in the war effort during the Second World War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the gameboard one can see a snake pattern of squares with 18 illustrations and directions. On the right are the title, instructions and 4 playing pieces to be cut out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
