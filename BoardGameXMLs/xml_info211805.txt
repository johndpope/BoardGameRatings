			<description>Notorious is a strategic dice drafting, resource management, set collection game. You'll draft new crew members and complete heists to earn the most Notoriety points to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You started as a small-time hood. But you know to become king of this city, you&amp;rsquo;ll need a crew. Assemble the right team, complete heists, and gain notoriety. As you finish more jobs, the heat on you becomes stronger. If one of your squad gets pinched, you can always work the system with a bribe, or just let them go to the slammer. Outlast your rivals and see if you have what it takes to become the most NOTORIOUS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;As a new boss, you will complete small jobs by rolling dice. You&amp;rsquo;ll use the earnings (jewels) from these small jobs to buy new members to join your crew. These Crew members will combine their abilities together to allow you to complete larger Heists. Every Heist you complete will earn you Notoriety points to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you can do any 2 of the following:&lt;br/&gt;1.    Roll dice (completing small jobs)&lt;br/&gt;2.    Draft up to 2 crew cards&lt;br/&gt;3.    Complete up to 2 heists&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rolling Dice - If you roll dice, you roll your choice of 2 of the 3 colored dice (red, blue, and green), and roll 1 of the 2 black and white dice. You can keep and/or re-roll any of the dice once, so that&amp;rsquo;s a total of 2 total rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dice representation: Blue die = Sapphires. Green die = Emeralds. Red die = Rubies. The diamond shape represents a Diamond. The Flame shape represents Surveillance. The Star on the Black die represents the player earning a Jewel of the player&amp;rsquo;s choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drafting Crew Cards &amp;ndash; The cost of the Crew Card is detailed in the upper left portion of the card. You can pay the jewel cost (earned from rolling dice), and that crew member is now part of your crew. You will play that Crew Card on the table in front of you. A new Crew Card replaces the drafted Crew Card on the table. - Each crew member has attributes which will help players complete Heists. Some crew members have special abilities which will improve your abilities, or hinder the play of your competitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Completing Heists &amp;ndash; If you have enough attributes from your collective Crew Cards, you may complete the Heists. The Heist requirements are detailed at the bottom of the Heist Card. You will add your Crew Card attributes together, and if those attributes total to at least the minimum required for each Heist requirement, you may complete the Heist. You will take the Heist card and keep it on the table in front of you. A new Heist Card is placed face up on the table to replace any Heist Card taken by a player. Each Heist Card has a Notoriety point value at the top right. The first player to earn at least 21 Notoriety points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
