			<description>A double race game: each player has a car and a boat. They race round circuits which cross in four places, which have drawbridges. Their position can be &amp;quot;UP&amp;quot; for boats to go through or &amp;quot;DOWN&amp;quot; for cars to go over. When doubles are rolled on the dice, bridges change position, often depending on the vote of all the players. Cars and boats cannot stop. They are damaged by hitting other cars/boats or bridges, and then go slower. At the end, players score according to their finishing order and how damaged they are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
