			<description>Guts the Game is a party game in which players take the role of clowns who are creating their own businesses. The game is mostly economic in nature with players buying stock in companies, licensing and selling products, and attempting hostile takeovers of opponents businesses. Since the game is clown themed, players are required to do things like honk a horn when they take over another company and wear a clown nose when they miss a turn. The name of the game refers to needing guts to start a business (and to be a clown apparently).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The back of the box ask what clowns have to do with running your own business but the game never answers that question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
