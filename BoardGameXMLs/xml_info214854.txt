							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Potion of Duck</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though it&amp;rsquo;s rare to find it in this day and age, connoisseurs of mystical goods will occasionally encounter a potion bearing this label:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Burdened by a foe who turns your face to a scowl? &lt;br/&gt;Take revenge with this concoction most fowl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the laymen, this will likely mean nothing. To the learned collector however, this &amp;ldquo;fowl&amp;rdquo; brew is one of the most prized potions in all the land. For this, dear friends, is the Potion of Duck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imbued with potent powers of Polymorph, the Potion of Duck will transform any person or creature who drinks it into a helpless, feathered water bird. Their arms will turn to wings. Their mouth to a bill and, of course, their voice to a honking quack. The transformation is temporary. Even so, a single gulp is enough to transform even the mightiest of men into a duck for a space of six hours. And the more one drinks, the more powerful the effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
