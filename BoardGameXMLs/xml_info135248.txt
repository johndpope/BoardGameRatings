			<description>&amp;quot;The War to end all Wars,&amp;quot; a war in which the idealism and nationalism of the late 19th Century met the technological realities of the 20th Century head on. The combination of the offensive power of heavy artillery and the defensive power of field works and the machine gun resulted in a &amp;quot;war \of positions.&amp;quot; Movement is not excluded, but is limited in its scope, with the &amp;quot;break-in&amp;quot; replacing the &amp;quot;break-through.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction: These rules are designed to fight portions of the major battles on the tactical level. Players take the part of battalion and company commanders, the highest level of command which could exert a significant influence on the course of the battle once it had begun. After becoming familiar with the rules, players should be able to recreate actions in some of the great battles of the war such as the Marne, Ypres, Gallipoli, Verdun, the Somme, Passchendale, the Argonnes Forest or the Kaiserschlagt. With experience, each player should be able to comfortably handle a battalion size unit of 500 to 100 men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Time: 1 turn = five minutes.&lt;br/&gt;Ground Scale: 1&amp;quot; - 15 yards.&lt;br/&gt;Figure Scale: 1 15mm casting = 3-5 men.&lt;br/&gt;              1 5mm stand = 3-5 men.&lt;br/&gt;              1 artillery or machinegun casting = 1 gun&lt;br/&gt;              Each vehicle/aircraft = 1 vehicle/aircraft&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
