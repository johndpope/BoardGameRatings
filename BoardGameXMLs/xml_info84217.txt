			<description>The player has to fight through thirty floors of the Deadalus space station to reach their ultimate objective. For every floor of the station there are key cards in random locations, each one required in order for the player to advance to the next stage. Few missions require the player to seek and destroy a specific object such as the station's reactor cores. The player could download floor maps and turn on the lights to darkened areas, but none of which were required for progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player's mech-armor, the Laocorn, is equipped with four different weapons and a generator that enables the mech to perform one of many abilities. The weapons consisted of an arm-punch, Vulcan, Laser gun and Missile launcher, each one being upgradeable in power and ammunition count. There were certain kamikaze enemies that appeared on floors that the player stayed too long in that carried downgrade items that, if the player picked the item up, would degrade the upgrade of whichever weapon they were armed with at that time. The Laocorn's generator abilities included helpful options in otherwise harmful situations. The abilities included Hover allowing the mech to hover a few feet over energy grids, Re-Fresh which replenishes the mech's energy, Plasma Barrier which serves as a temporary shield and the Blaze Laser which destroys every enemy on screen. Each ability consumed a certain level of generator energy which could be refilled through Generator pick-up items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Robotica (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
