			<description>Delicio, the yummy food game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game: &lt;br/&gt;The first player to fill his or her plate with a balanced meal wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;Spread all the pieces of &amp;quot;food&amp;quot; out on the table, facedown, around the central board.  Each player takes a &amp;quot;plate&amp;quot;, which has 8 colored squares on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll the six-sided die to move around the circular central game board and stop on a colored square.  Turn over a card corresponding to that color and place it on your plate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each colored space corresponds to a food group.  Each food card is identified by a color next to the food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red: meat and other protein (e.g. beans)&lt;br/&gt;Yellow: breads and cereals&lt;br/&gt;Green: fruits and vegetables&lt;br/&gt;Blue: dairy products&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plates have one red, one blue, two yellow, and three green squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
