			<description>Cows Vs Visitors by Omni-Miniatures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is a table top Miniatures stratagy game that uses a 6d system. Cows VS Visitors throws in a twist to the usual table top games by the use of drop cards that have random objects (Like &amp;quot;probe&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Angry Cat&amp;quot;)that are drawn when a team captures an objective token and use the drop card as a weapon in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles can be set up on a 4x4 table where you can use your own imagination to create your own senery and cover. The miniatures are sold in sets and are suplied un-painted and the Cows miniatures require assembly, making this a great choice for the hobby gamer who enjoys customising. The Cows VS Vistors Starter set is sold with everything you need to play minus the ruler and metal minis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the starter set You get the rulebook, one deck of drop cards, drop card markers, dice, full color card stock playing pieces with plastic stands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
