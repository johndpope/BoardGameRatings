							<name  sortindex="1">Merv Griffin&#039;s Word for Word Game by Mattel</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Word for Word</name>
									
			<description>In the first two rounds, players take turns trying to make small words from a large word. Each player has about fifteen seconds, timed by a mechanical timer, to construct a word. When a player fails to construct a word within the time limit, the opponent may continue making words. A game ends with a scrambled word game. The one who solves the scrambled word based on the clues provided wins a prize card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who has the more valuable prizes after three games is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is faithful adaptation of a television series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
