			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Night Racer is a fast and furious rally through the forests of Central Europe in a race organized by the Intercontinental Rally Championship. Being careful not to crash, you must race against time to make it to the next checkpoint. The catch is that the racers are being held at night. Additionally, every car carries explosives that can only be defused at checkpoints. Hence, not only do you have to be careful not to crash, you also have to race against time to make it to the next checkpoint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
