							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sword and Spear: Fantasy</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;This ruleset, Sword &amp;amp; Spear Fantasy, is based on the Sword &amp;amp; Spear ancient and medieval wargames rules which are designed for playing out large battles of the period from about 3000BC to 1500AD.  They are an evolution of that ruleset, with rules added to cover all of the required fantasy elements, but at its heart it is the same core mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My intention was to make this mainly a game about units of infantry and cavalry (of whatever size and race and type) manoeuvring and  fighting on the battlefield. All of the extra features such as magic, heroes, monsters, flying creatures and other exotic troop types add extra  flavour and interest, and can impact the battle, but should not dominate it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My aim with magic (matching the overall philosophy of the rules) was for the outcome to matter, but not the detail. So there are no long lists of named spells to choose from. Instead, just a few main effects are catered for (which on the whole are the same effects that would be covered by a list of lots of different spells) &amp;ndash; increasing the effectiveness of friendly units, attacking the enemy and healing or rallying friendly units.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Excerpt from the Appendix&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
