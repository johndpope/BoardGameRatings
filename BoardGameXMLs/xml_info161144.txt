			<description>The Beavers have to build lodges and collect winter stores, but always have to expect flooding and interference by other beavers from the neighboring areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with a pair of beavers and a set of trees in different colors. On your turn you roll a dice and move a beaver. If he comes to a tree field, he may take the tree in his stock or build it in the lodge. Two Beavers on marginal fields carry out a turf war: This is decided with dice: who rolls higher wins. The winner can take a tree in the lodge or a tree as a food supply from the loser. Who first completes his lodge and fills his sfood supply wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
