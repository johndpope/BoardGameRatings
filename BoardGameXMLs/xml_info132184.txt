							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Track Meet</name>
									
			<description>This video game offers seven different events in the spirit of the 1992 Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain. There are five different opponents to compete against in events like long jump, the 100-meter dash, and weightlifting. Each competitor has his own strengths and weaknesses that either help or hinder his performance on certain events. Once the player has more points than his opponents, he becomes the grand champion of the Summer Olympic Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two players can compete using the Game Link cable that was sold separately from the Game Boy portable console devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Track Meet&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
