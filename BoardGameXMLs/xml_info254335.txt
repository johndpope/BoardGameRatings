			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster Combat is a game in which you go wandering through a forest trying to win as much treasure as you can from various monsters without getting yourself killed in the process.  It was written in BASIC for a KIM microprocessor and for display on a high speed video board, but can easily be converted to almost any other BASIC or video board.  It requires at least 16K of RAM to be run, which is the main reason there are no spaces between commands on the program listing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster Combat was written by Lee Chapel and published as type-in source code in Creative Computing, Volume 7, Number 2, February 1981.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
