			<description>The boardgame version of a quiz show aired on the danish radio station P3. Players compete in seven different categories; the 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's, grand prix, danish rock and the idols of today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn players roll a dice to determine from which of the categories they will receive a question. Each question card has three different question difficulties which rewards a right answer accordingly with 1, 2 or 3 points. A right answer also lets the player roll the dice again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player is the first to reach 10 points in a category, the category is closed and that player receives a victory point. The  first player to accumulate 4 victory points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
