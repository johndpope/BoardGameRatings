			<description>It's fun, it's exciting &amp;amp; most of all it's unlike any other game you've played!!!&lt;br/&gt;Traveling along the tracks you'll need to be vigilant at all times. Countless names but only seconds to say one, how quick can you think?&lt;br/&gt;Keep your wits about you, collect all your passengers &amp;amp; deliver them safely to the central station. Watch out though, your opponents could steal them at anytime!&lt;br/&gt;It's more about who you know, than what you know! Just roll the dice...Land on a category (films, well known people, actors &amp;amp; actresses, sports people, t.v. programs or music)....Say a valid name in 30 seconds. Simple!!!&lt;br/&gt;For example, it's your turn, the player to your right has just said &amp;quot;George Michael&amp;quot; (they were on a music square). You roll the dice, move four spaces &amp;amp; land on a T.V. square....you now have 30 seconds to say the name of a T.V.program that begins with the last letter of the previous answer, 'L'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
