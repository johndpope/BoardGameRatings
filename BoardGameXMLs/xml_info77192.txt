							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bible Buffet</name>
									
			<description>Bible Buffet is a video game released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993 by Wisdom Tree, a company which specialised in Christian-themed video games. Like many of their games, Bible Buffet was not licensed by Nintendo. Despite being called Bible Buffet, the game has no internal technical references to the Bible, Christianity, or religion in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, up to four players move their pieces around a board similar to the physical board game Candy Land, participating in mini-arcade games at certain locations on the playfield. Its game engine was later used in the Wisdom Tree's Spiritual Warfare. This game is one of the few NES games to have voices, the others are the Sesame Street games for NES, Bart vs. the Space Mutants, Ghostbusters (video game), and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bible Buffet,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
