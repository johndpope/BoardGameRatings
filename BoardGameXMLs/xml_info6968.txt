			<description>Who Said That? is a game for everyone with 400 quotes taken from famous people, commercials, movies, cartoon characters and more! On your team's turn, you get two quotes, one at a time. When you guess Who Said It? correctly -- and in time! -- you move ahead two spaces on the game board.  Stuck? That's okay! Ask your opponents to read the hint that comes with the quote and if you're able to give the right answer now, you still get to move ahead on the board one space. Some quotes will be ones that come in a snap! Others are right at the tip of your tongue and just need that hint to help you through. Some will be tougher, but a good guess might be all you need to get your mover towards the finish. The first team (or player) to do that, wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
