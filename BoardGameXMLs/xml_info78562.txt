			<description>from the publisher's website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anarchy may be described as a fast and furious parody of trick-taking games, the point being that you all play at once instead of going through the laborious and time-consuming process of taking turns - which of course is undemocratic, conferring an unearned privilege on whoever goes first, and being therefore suitable only for the decadent entertainment of a hierarchic-&amp;eacute;litist society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a card and then they are all flipped at the same time. The player with the highest card of each suit wins the other cards of that suit that were also played during that hand. If there is only one of a suit, it is compared to the other individual cards and the player with the highest card collects them all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the turn, you must decide what you are playing for. You can try and simply collect the most cards or go for a specific color, suit or the least amount of cards. The more specific you option the more points you get at the end of the round, which occurs once all cards have been played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played to a specific amount of points and once a player reaches that number, they are declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
