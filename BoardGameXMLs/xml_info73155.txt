			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heartland is a fantasy action/maze game developped in 1986 by Odin Computer Graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a magician who must destroy pages out of a magical book. The game is played in a 2D side-view maze flick-screen environment, and the player goes from room to room in search of the pages, and spells. Some rooms contain foes that can be defeated with spells (shooting them), and all object in the rooms appear floating in the air after staying in the room for a while, and the player has to jump up to catch them, careful of not touching the vile clouds that will drain his energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though a 2D game, there are also doorways leading &amp;quot;into&amp;quot; the screen and &amp;quot;out of&amp;quot; the screen, making the navigation on the levels really tricky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
