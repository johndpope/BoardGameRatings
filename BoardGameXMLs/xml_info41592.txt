							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Black 7</name>
									
			<description>The game consists of cards numbered 3 to 11. The 7 is placed in the middle, the others in a circle around it. The player whose turn it is, rolls two dice and places a chip on the card with the value rolled. If there is a chip already, he/she can take it instead. If someone rolls a 7, though, he/she always has to place a chip, on rolling a two or twelve, one can take all chips (in case of the two, except the ones on the 7). The last player to still hold chips, wins. The chips are not included in the game material.&lt;br/&gt;This was one of six games in Piatnik's 1989 Texas Series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
