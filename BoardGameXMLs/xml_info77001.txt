			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An exploration puzzle-type semi-narrative game, where the player plays a 10 centimeter tall household robot. The player runs around in the rooms in the house, such as living room, kitchen and entrance hall, picking up trash and cleaning dirty spots on the floor. Doing these things will gain the player &amp;quot;Happy points&amp;quot;, which gradually enhances the robot's battery life and the purchase of extra equipment for coins that the player finds. The player must also collect a variety of objects and such to be able to overcome certain difficulties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game switches between daytime and nighttime. During the night, the family sleeps and the toys around the house come to life. The player's goal is to help both family and toys with their problems and worries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chibi-robo is partly the design of legendary Kenichi Nishi, the founder of LoveDelic, Skip and Route24.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Personal credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kenichi Nishi - design&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
