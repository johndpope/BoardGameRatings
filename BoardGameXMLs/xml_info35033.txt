							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">For the Birds</name>
									
			<description>There are 4 game rules included in each deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was developed for two purposes. It was developed with young children and their parents in mind. All age groups can play the same game and experience challenges appropriate to their age. Secondly, we chose birds because they are  important to our ecosystem and have significant habitat overlap with humans. We wanted to create a game where children and adults would learn about the natural world around them. As a result of that learning, we hoped people would go out to explore and protect their natural world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More games rules are available for free download. Games include basic memory games for children, and more advanced set building and area control games for adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
