			<description>Consumption is a worker placement/resource management game about meeting your body's food needs. Shopping and cooking or going out to various eateries is central to the strategy that is balanced by physical activity to help you burn extra calories. Points are earned by completing recipes and activities, but ultimately, giving your body what it needs to be happy earns the most points, as various diseases can sneak up on you if you're not careful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over six rounds, players select actions on the main game board, as well as their player board, such as cooking or going out to eat. To cook, players must first go grocery shopping for ingredients, but careful planning is needed as food can expire if it isn't used in time, and fighting your cravings may cause a few problems too. Completing recipes unlocks extra abilities, which can be very useful during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eating out is also an option, and going to the buffet or visiting the stands at the farmer's market can be tempting; decisions may depend on what they have to offer. While cooking both allows players more control over what they eat and provides points, it can be hard to resist the drive-thru when you can get so much food! All food, represented by colored cubes, goes into the player's &amp;quot;body&amp;quot; based on different food groups, and as the game progresses, it is possible that players may find they have eaten too much of one or more groups. Time to exercise!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a variety of activities, players may remove cubes from their body to return to a healthier state, but don't wait too long as this may require more time than you think! Completed activities offer end-game points, so don&amp;rsquo;t be a couch potato! After six rounds, players see which of their food needs have been met and how many different activities they have completed, and the player with the most points is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consumption is fun, easy to learn, and offers deep strategy and intuitive mechanisms. It has high replay value and engages families and gamers alike. For 1-4 players who love to eat!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consumption won 3rd place in the game design contest at KublaCon 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
