			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Citizens, the war is won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evil has been vanquished, their land cleansed of their foul presence and their troops driven back to the caves where they belong. The earth has started to heal from the damages it has sustained during the war, but much work still must be done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was created for Game Chef 2017: Borders; however the author felt it was not complete/polished enough to submit as an entry.  It was provided to interested participants but not considered for the competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
