			<description>YOU are the general today. YOU command the infantry, send out the cavalry and position the cannon. YOU decide to fight, attack, retreat or defend. Our &amp;quot;battlefield&amp;quot; series offers easy to learn rules and simple strategy for all ages. (From the game insert.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling dice and moving their troops around the board. Using railroads or Shenandoah Valley can speed movement of tenacious infantry, mobile cavalry, and defensive cannons around the Eastern theater of war. Once three strategic objectives are achieved players can close in on their opponent's capital. Winning an infantry battle over the enemy capital wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
