							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">World War II in the West</name>
									
			<description>World War II in the West a division-corps scale wargame depicting the Second World War in Europe and North and East Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;World War II in the West gives you control of all of the major participating nations that fought World War II, and allows you to play a simple yet accurate portrayal of the war. World War II in the West was originally designed for play with Axis and Allies figures and rule, but is now a stand-alone game which includes over 1,600 counters. However, the rules and the hex sizes still allow Axis and Allies fans to get the most accurate World War II wargame they can find while still using the popular rules and pieces if they wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In fact, World War II in the West can be used effectively to bring Axis and Allies fans into the wargaming hobby as the game combines some of the features of Axis and Allies and conventional counter wargames to produce a new style of game that is simple yet complex, fun yet challenging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With World War II in the West, you fight for the convoy routes, have air battles over London, conduct landing operations on the northern French coast, outflank and surround forces on the Eastern Front, and manage the industrial output of your nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;World War II in the West includes over 1,600 counters depicting the armed forces of the major belligerents as well as informational counters needed to play the game. Along with the major nations, you can find in the counter mix Canadian, Australian, New Zealander, South African, Czech, Indian, and East African units, as well as the well-known Spanish Blue Division that fought on the Eastern Front with the German Army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The beautifully hand-drawn map is made up of 12-pieces, totalling a size of 50 by 40 inches. Also included is a smaller East African map to be used in play. The map has all of the charts and boxes needed for game play and has a scale of approximately 150km per hex. The hexes are large enough to hold Axis and Allies pieces, but it is ideally played with the counters that are sized to decrease mess and accidents during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is best played with the grand campaign which runs from September 1939 until the end of 1945, in monthly and bi-weekly turns. Two scenarios are included with the game allowing you to play the war in Africa or Operation Overlord in a shorter time than the campaign game. Also, new scenarios will be posted on the website.&lt;br/&gt; World War II in the West&amp;rsquo;s complexity is what sets it apart. It sets it apart from the other Axis and Allies games as the complexity is far greater and the history  more accurate. It also sets it apart from the conventional  counter wargames as its complexity is slightly more simple, yet still depicts the war accurately while being fun and challenging. This is not a simple game, but its complexity allows both experienced and beginner wargamers to understand the rules and enjoy the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;World War II in the West can be combined with World War II in the East to play the entire global war, both games combining to use over 2,500 counters and 25 square feet of maps!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
