							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hadeshill Asylum</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a solid reputation built on generations of good and effective treatment, many families send their loved ones for treatment at the Hadeshill Asylum. The relatives visit, and are pleased to see the patients receiving care and treatment. But eventually the relatives stop visiting, and that's when the facade drops and the patients are quieltly moved to the facilities downstairs, behind the clean walls of the bathroom and treatement rooms. And the don't return...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A set of printable battlemaps compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl game. Use as a standalone gameboard, or combine with any same-scale tileset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: A set of three 20 x 20 maps depicting an asylum. The ground floor depicts the autumnal street and entrance to the asylum, with rooms for dining, a reception, common room for the nurses and a kitchen and caretaker office. Upstairs are the patient bedrooms, a wash room, patient records and stores. However, the basement is a rather more sinister location. The first rooms encountered still wear the mask of respectibility, and include treatement rooms and bathrooms. But the basement also holds cells for patients, electroshock rooms, restraining rooms, an operating theatre and a morgue for those that do not survive their treatments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are 300dpi full size jpgs, for poster printing or VTT. (n.b. gridless version only available as jpeg)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
