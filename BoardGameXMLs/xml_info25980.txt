			<description>This Dutch cycling game from 1965 has a board of 38x35cm., it also contains several figures ( a green and yellow jersey, mountain jersey) and the tour-caravan pawn. There is also a die and a number of chips. The board has the Tour de France route of 1965 printed on it. Every player gets some chips as starting money. After a stage is decided the tour caravan pawn moves to the next stage. Every stage has a number printed on, this is important for the dice rolling. Since this is purely a dicing game the rules are very simplistic. U can earn or lose chips depending on how the dice role. The game is over after the tour caravan reaches the final stage in Paris. The player who has the most chips at this point wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
