			<description>From the back of the module:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shadowed streets and alleys of the City of Rogues echo with cries of terror . . . The shadowed alleys of Bet Seder are no longer silent, for a dark presence has fallen across the Seaport District of the City of Rogues.  Cries in the misty night herald the arrival of a terrible evil, an evil beyond that experienced by the most hardened rogue, bloodthirsty pirate or debauched noble lord.  The Sirocco's Kiss reaches out across the waters of Elos Bay; will the characters defeat the evil, or will they be engulfted by its dark embrace?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventures is designed for use with five to seven characters of 1st through 3rd level, though it can easily be adapted for use with any mid-level to high-level adventuring group.  The Seaport District of Bet Seder is also described in detail, from taverns and inns to temples and brothels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sirocco's Kiss Kalamar Quest adventure and supplement is designed to provide both a challenging adventure and useful supplementary campaign material.  The material within is set in the popular Kingdoms of Kalamar fantasy campaign setting but can easily be used with any fantasy role-playing game setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game adventure and supplement is suitable for use with any fantasy role-playing system, including but not limited Advanced Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, Rolemaster and HackMaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
