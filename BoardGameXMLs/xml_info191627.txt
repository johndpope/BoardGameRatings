							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ritual Magic Expanded for 5th Edition Fantasy</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ritual magic is interesting and accessible even to non-spellcasters, but as a concept, it is currently underdeveloped. There are too few ritual spells. By expanding this concept, there can be many opportunities to provide players and game masters with more spellcasting utility, and also to weave magic into your story in a way that is holistic and does not imbalance your campaign. This product contains many new rituals, as well as guidelines for the use of rituals by non-casters, rewarding players with ritual knowledge, and providing a deeper subtext for magic within your campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product line brings you an assortment of ideas, homebrew rules, and various options from the talented pool of writers at Fat Goblin Games for use with the  world&amp;rsquo;s oldest role playing game. These short and low-priced products are perfect for Game Masters and Players who want to integrate unique new options to their games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
