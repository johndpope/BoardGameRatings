			<description>Houston, we have problems! Meteors incoming! The llama armageddon (llamaged&amp;oacute;n in short) is coming and llamas are afraid of it. To brace themselves for the end of the world, they need to build shelters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Llamaged&amp;oacute;n is a slightly strategic and light card game that combines mechanics such as hand management, take that and set collection. On their turn, a player draws a card from the deck. If they draw a Shelter card, then they have to play it immediately by placing it down. Shelters can also be built by combining resources. Beside playing shelters or building them, a player can use one action card which might involve attacking or stealing shelters, swapping one card for another, skipping the next player's turn, protecting your shelter, drawing two cards from the deck or even canceling the action of another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually, a player will draw the Llamaged&amp;oacute;n card from the deck (which was randomly shuffled into the lower half of the deck) and this means everyone gets another two turns. After that, whoever has the most shelters is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 60 cards plus 5 reference cards and it's in both Spanish and English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you like llamas, meteors and sheeps, then Llamaged&amp;oacute;n might be a good fit for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
