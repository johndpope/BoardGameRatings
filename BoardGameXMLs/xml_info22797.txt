			<description>Make-Shift / Clou is an abstract game that looks a lot like Tic-Tac-Toe. The board is a 3x3 grid with 8 tiles that can slide inside the board with spaces on top for player pieces, which are colored plastic disks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to complete a row, column or diagonal of three of your own pieces. However each player only has 3 pieces and the 3 x 3 grid is occupied by only 8 sliding tiles where player pieces can be played. So, although it looks like Tic-Tac-Toe, the game play is completely different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you can either play a piece onto an empty tile, move a piece from one tile onto an empty tile, or slide a tile into the empty space. The other player is not allowed to slide a just-moved tile back to where it came from, thus preventing game lock up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you get 3 in a row, you win the round and the first player to win 6 rounds wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
