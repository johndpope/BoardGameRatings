							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sailing Port Flower</name>
									
			<description>In this piecepack sailing race, players have to reach all five buoys and be back in Port Flower first in order to win. Players control the movement of both their boat and a shark of their choice by dividing the outcome of the dice roll. Sharks can set players back in the game, since the organization of the race does not want the contestants to be in danger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
