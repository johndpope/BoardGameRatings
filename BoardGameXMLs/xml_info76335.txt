			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story Goal: Prevent the invasion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Main Villain: Noel Quincarnon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Villain&amp;rsquo;s Allies: Vikings raiders, Viking scouting party, 2 Viking spies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genre, Time, Setting &amp;amp; Mood&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genre: Fantasy / Mystery&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time Period: 1121&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting: Small town near Wexford, Ireland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mood: suspense / fantasy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Backstory &lt;br/&gt;The week of April 20 began on a low note. Brach Aed-Ceallachan died in a suspicious&lt;br/&gt;fire, and his kin conducted the laborious task of alerting all of his relatives so that they might be present for&lt;br/&gt;the funeral. He had been well loved and respected by all that knew him. Rarely a day went by that&lt;br/&gt;Brach didn&amp;rsquo;t labor for others or work on his projects in the wilderness outside of town. Many were&lt;br/&gt;beholden to him for his efforts.&lt;br/&gt;The death came as a shock to many, and his clan dispatched two family members and charged&lt;br/&gt;them with finding out the real cause of the fire. Several of the other members of the town have been&lt;br/&gt;making their own inquiries, as a murder having been committed within the confines of the town endangers&lt;br/&gt;everyone.&lt;br/&gt;The funeral of Brach was slated to be done on a dreary Sunday in mid May. As everyone gathers&lt;br/&gt;for the services, some among those present wonder just what the next few days hold in store for those who&lt;br/&gt;would ask questions&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
