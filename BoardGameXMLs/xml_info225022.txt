							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flames of Freedom: Beginnings</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long march to freedom begins here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the world watches and both sides draw up the plans of war, others lurk in the shadows, prowling forgotten tunnels, and heroes battle. An ancient enemy sows seeds of strife, and a much larger battle is about to begin. While Colonists cry for freedom and Loyalists struggle to reconcile with England, dark enemies gnaw and plague the unsuspecting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Boston, the siege grinds on, but the end is in sight. Now is the time to break the yoke of tyranny on the city that sparked the revolution. Secret plots, secret cults, and mysteries abound, as you explore the city of Boston during the last days of the siege. You are at the start of the revolution and will be caught up in a series of events that will take you from one end of the city to the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory in Boston is only short live.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spring, 1776. The Second Continental Congress works at creating a new nation. But as they debate, shadowy forces prepare to strike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Philadelphia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;William Penn's model city is one of the richest in the Thirteen Colonies. It stands at the heart of the Revolution. Home to book shops, thinkers, and a growing intellectual class, the city hides those with knowledge of a more questionable nature. With the leadership of the Revolution here, the city is awash with plots, and dangers. It is here that many plots are about to meet, and it is far from certain who will stand the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Congress works, the Heroes scour the City of Brotherly Love for a friend's missing son. Not all is as it appears, and soon their simple assignment turns into a race against time to prevent a tragedy that could kill the American independence before it has begun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flames of Freedom: Beginnings, is the first volume in an epic campaign for Colonial Gothic. In this book, you will find our guide to the great cities of Boston and Philadelphia, and a ready-to-play adventure which sets the stage for the entire Revolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
