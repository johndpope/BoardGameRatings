			<description>Atomix A.X.E. (Armory, Accessories, and Equipment) is a detailed equipment plugin for the Fuzion roleplaying game.  From the opening:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The  Armory, Accessories, and Equipment catalog, otherwise known as A.X.E., is a modern day catalog of modern weapons, armor, and equipment for use in any modern or near-future Fuzion campaign.  As of release 3.0 of Atomik WAR (A.W.E), all weapons and equipment have been removed from the sourcebook and placed into this catalog, in order to more modularize the two as separate entities.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
