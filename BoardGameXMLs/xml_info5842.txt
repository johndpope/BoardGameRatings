							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Beat Inflation Strategy Game</name>
									
			<description>Arguably one of The Avalon Hill Game Co's least successful designs, Beat Inflation has players buying and selling two different types of assets (real and paper), trying to make a profit as inflation rises and falls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players buy an asset at high risk, medium risk or low risk... and wait until the time is right to sell it for the biggest profit.  Starting with $100,000 in loans, the first player to make $1,000,000 is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
