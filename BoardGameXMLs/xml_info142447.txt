			<description>Time Strike is a 2 player PnP card combat style game where you have to keep wondering not where you're being hit, but when!  You fight an opponent in 40 second rounds.  The player that scores the most hits, wins the round, and whomever wins the most rounds, wins the fight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fights take place using on the timeline, where players must add time cards before being able to play attack cards.  Time Strike is highly strategic because you can have a full-on combo planned that could be thwarted by an attack a few moments before your combo.  Keep your opponent guessing, but keep your guard up in this intense time based battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awards:&lt;br/&gt;Tied for 2nd place in the 2012 Mashup Game Design &amp; Artwork Contest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
