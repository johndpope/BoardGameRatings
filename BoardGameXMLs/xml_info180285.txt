							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crumbling Building</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a full-color, 8 inch by 10 inch, floor plan of a Crime Scene, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Alright detectives. We need you to investigate the crime scene. You&amp;rsquo;ll be working with a civil engineer on site to determine if the building fell as a result of a code violation or something more sinister &amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;Police Sergeant Graff&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crumbling Building is a one page exterior map of a fallen brick building next to a road. This building fell recently, killing someone on the street below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crumbling Building is intended for use in modern, post-apocalyptic, pulp, or horror games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure idea for this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Falling Infrastructure: As the city ages, more and more of the older brick buildings are deteriorating and falling. The city has avoided casualties&amp;mdash;at least until today. A building fell over and killed a man dead in the street. The group playing as detectives is ordered to investigate the scene with the help of a civil engineer on site to determine if the building fell from neglect and code violations or something worse like an explosion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When they get to the crime scene, they find the building and its surroundings in terrible shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The amount of damage doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be right for a mere falling down of a building. Skid marks on the ground seem fresh in the street. The manhole cover indicates a very nearby escape route and has a spray painted yellow outline similar to the ones locating companies use (these companies spray paint to identify underground utility lines such as electric cables, phone cables, water lines, and natural gas lines) but with no other spray painted lines in the area seems very suspicious. The police officers have left chalk outlines of the victim in the street and cordoned off the area. The victim has been sent to a morgue for a full autopsy, but on site evidence seems to indicate a head trauma based on blood splatter patterns. The group needs to figure out what happened with the civil engineer to the building and make sense of the various clues on site to solve the crime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
