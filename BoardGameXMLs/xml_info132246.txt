							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Trek Generations: Beyond the Nexus</name>
									
			<description>The game loosely followed the plot of the then-recently released Star Trek Generations motion picture. Notable departures included an additional battle against Tholian forces, a Romulan ambush involving both space and ground combat at Amargosa Station and a different resolution to the capture of Geordi La Forge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game combined three different styles of play with minor differences from level to level. Spaceflight was done in a primitive pseudo-3D environment. Players steered their ship from a first-person point of view, moving between markers or using phasers and later photon torpedoes to attack enemy vessels. On-foot levels were played from a top-down perspective and involved either phaser combat or labyrinth-like pathfinding. The remaining levels consisted of simple puzzles such as symbol matching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Star Trek Generations: Beyond the Nexus&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
