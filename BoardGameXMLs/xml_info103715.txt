			<description>3 on 3 is a very simple game.  In it, you have 3 different colored pieces that can stack on each other, each a different color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a turn, a player moves the top piece on one of the spaces onto the board to another space, and scores points for that color.  Players must either move a piece from, or a piece to, a space which didn't either have a piece from it or to it the last turn (after the first turn this is true.  The first turn a piece may move to any empty space).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a piece of a given color moves onto a space, its color scores 1 point for the number of pieces currently on that space (after landing on it).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has one of the colors as their color.  The object of the game is for a player to have their color have the lowest score after any of the colors reached the target score selected at the start of the game (20-30 points is usually an ideal target score for a quick game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While not initially intended, this game is now part of a planned series of games played on a single line, that will contain at least 3 games.  Two more are in the works.  This may change, but this is the plan of this moment.  Keep an eye out for a Geeklist containing the games in this planned series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
