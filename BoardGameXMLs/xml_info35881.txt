			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        CANCELLED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         The information that BGG has on this item indicates that Call of Duty Real-Time Card Game will not enter production.  This entry currently serves as a placeholder for the announced item and will likely later be removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A real-time battle based card game where players deploy 3 soldiers to the battlefield from their squad deck. Action cards activate these soldiers, as they battle it out in real-time. Soldiers fire, move, dive for cover, and attack the enemy, with the first player to a  certain number of frags declared the winner. Decks from different countries can be combined to create new strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two players set up on a 5x5 grid and attempt to win through either earning a preset number of points won by kills or achieve some other mission based objective such as capture the flag. The different &amp;quot;game modes&amp;quot; are quite similar to what one would find in the video game upon which it is based.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays in real time so players are forced to find a balance between speed and strategy. Each player has a deck from which they draw cards one at a time and play them as fast as they can (or discard them if they cannot be played). Certain cards trigger a pause in the action at which time all effects (except movement which is handled as it comes up) are resolved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the 8 different, but non-collectible, squad decks come with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    60-card deck&lt;br/&gt;    8 Soldier cards&lt;br/&gt;    2 Mission cards&lt;br/&gt;    Double-sided game map&lt;br/&gt;    Rules sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
