This module features 40 pages of adventure, with multiple levels above and below ground that are sure to provide several game session of enjoyment for the GM and players alike!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The usually peaceful and serene Alderburgh Valley has been shaken recently by a series of unnatural earthquakes and the preternaturally skilled predation of a band of brigands who sail on the pirate ship &amp;ldquo;Scoundrel&amp;rsquo;s Run&amp;rdquo;. Can you put a stop to their reign of terror?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elsewhere, an ancient tower has suddenly popped into existence, from whence no one knows. Long forgotten tales spoke of a tower which was home to an evil wizard who consorted with all sorts of foul devils, demons and denizens of the Planes of Hell. Could this be the dark summoner&amp;rsquo;s tower returned after all these years? Where has it been? Is the wizard still alive? What great treasures and dangers lay waiting just inside the tower&amp;rsquo;s gates?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Still elsewhere, a powerful evil stirs in its ageless crypt beneath the surface of Alderburgh Valley. It is an ancient evil from ages past, sustained on the energy of powerful ley lines under its tomb, and it&amp;rsquo;s been brought to life again. Will you enter its lair and confront this evil before it is too late?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lastly, rumours abound that an ancient artifact, thought lost in ages past, has returned and it may be here in the Valley! Will you be the lucky ones to find this immeasurably powerful item?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure awaits in the Alderburgh Valley!
