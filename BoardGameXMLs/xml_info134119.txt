							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Magical Land of Yeld (Playtest Edition 1.0)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the play test edition of the Magical Land of Yeld, the new adventure game from the creators of Classroom Deathmatch and Sea Dracula! We're eager for your feedback and support. get in on the ground floor and help us make a better, stronger game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Magical Land of Yeld is a fantasy adventure game for all ages. By that I mean it&amp;rsquo;s a game that can be enjoyed by both children and adults. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to tap the feel of classic adventure role-playing video games that I enjoyed as a kid (Final Fantasy 2, Legend of Zelda, Secret of Mana) and young adult oriented adventure anime I enjoy now (Full Metal Alchemist, One Piece, InuYashu). So what you get out of this game, what you get to do, is be a group of kids from our world that discover a magical door that leads to the strange, dark, dangerous land of Yeld. At first you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to explore Yeld and safely return home. But eventually the door home will&lt;br/&gt;close, and you&amp;rsquo;ll be trapped! Once you become trapped in Yeld you&amp;rsquo;ll take Heroic Jobs and set out on an adventure to find hidden temples, defeat the Hunters of Yeld and win the magical keys to unlock the door back to the real world. You know how this works, right? It&amp;rsquo;s like Final Fantasy + Alice in Wonderland, or The Legend of Zelda mashed up with Narnia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns acting as the Game Master, creating adventures based on the other players input and ideas. Calender and map mechanics govern the time character spend in Yeld and where they can travel. The game has a beginning, with clear progression through a middle and an end that players actively work towards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
