			<description>Naruto Sugoroku is a roll-and-move game that was included as a tear-out insert in the Shonen Jump Naruto Collector magazine for Winter 2007/2008.  This game is loosely based on the traditional Chinese/Japanese game Sugoroku.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, players choose a character from the Naruto manga and then roll a die to move their characters along a track.  Some spaces have instructions that only affect one character--other characters may ignore the instructions.  If two players land on the same space, they play rock-paper-scissors, with the loser moving back one space.  Various &amp;quot;stage&amp;quot; spaces along the way allow a player to roll a die and move all other players back that number of spaces or to jump ahead is a one a rolled twice consecutively.  Certain events can put a player into a &amp;quot;passive state.&amp;quot;  While in a passive state, players are protected from most negative effects.  The last part of the path splits so each character has their own individual track.  Players must roll the exact number to land on the ending space, and must move back any excess spaces.  First player to arrive there wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
