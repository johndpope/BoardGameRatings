			<description>From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not a minion at all, but a suit of armour resurrected at the whim of its master. Izamu is an ancient blood thirsty warlord that lived during the old days of the Katanaka clan that Yan Lo was also a member of. Today, he is called upon by Yan Lo to bring death to all those that oppose him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Izamu's mobility is pretty unimpressive with a bog standard 4/6 move/charge and only one mobility trick to speak of which is Shove Aside (allows Izamu to nove through ht1 and 2 models). He does have a very respectable 3&amp;quot; melee range though. He also benefits greatly from mobility tricks given by other models, be it the Soul Porter with Empower Ancestor, Toshiro with Tenki no Juden or Molly and Imbue Vigor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now we are cooking with gas! Izamus is a melee monster packing Melee Expert, a base + to all his damage flips, a respectable combat of 6 on a range 3 weapon and a very nice damage spread of 3/4/6. That damage spread is his edge compared to the dead rider, Izamu can nuke a most low mid cost models in one severe strike. He also has a cute trigger with his Daodao that lets his weapon be considered magical if you get a tome which is nice since it's a suit ressers don't use much and is always nice to have that possibility when facing spirit heavy crews.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ironically, Izamu does not even have an armour rating. Instead he is an Object 2, which is actually better. This means he is reducing 2 damage from anything heading his way unless it ignores object and for now, very few things actually do that. His tankiness doesn't end there, he is also immune to influence, so WP strikes do nothing against him. He is able to nullify enemy triggers if he cheats fate on his defense and resist flips, the suit of the card he uses to cheat will not cause any of the triggers the enemy may be packing, so Lady Justice getting you down? cheat with a Ram and yeah, you may be taking the hit, but there is no onslaught or critical strike going in with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
