							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hungry Homer</name>
									
			<description>Homer Simpson is guarding an entire tray of his favorite sugary snacks, and it's your job is to try to remove them from his clutches! The three different sizes of donut earn players different amounts when removed successfully. The bigger the donut, the more points earned - but the higher the risk of upsetting Homer! On each turn, players roll a dice to determine which size of donut they go for. Play continues until Homer reaches the end of his tether, when he shoots forward, sending the donuts flying. This is a game of risk, nerve and lots of fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
