			<description>Faustus Furius is a fast and furious, tongue in cheek table-top racing game based very loosely around the chariot races of the ancient world and adaptable to any racing situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for 2-8 participants, it allows players to pit  chariots from any culture or period against one another in a no-holds-barred race to fame and glory.*&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    text from Publisher's website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn a player will roll between 1 and 3 dice (player choice), with each success gaining them an Action, and multiple failures causing potentially negative effects. A player might choose to play it safe, and roll only 1 die, or may push their luck and roll 2 or all 3. One of the neat spins in this version of that dice system is the idea of Normal dice and Fatigue dice. Normal dice succeed on a roll of 3+, while Fatigue dice succeed on a 4+, as the race wears on Normal dice are replaced by Fatigue dice, and the risk of having some sort of negative consequence from rolling multiple failures becomes more significant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spending the Actions a player gets from their dice allows them to do things, such as move further, turn, attack fellow Charioteers, and more, with complex actions like Sharp Turns and Inciting the Crowd, costing more Actions to perform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player that manages to complete a set of laps (decided before the game, and typically two) will win the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
