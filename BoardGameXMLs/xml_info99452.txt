							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blacksand Assassin</name>
									
			<description>From the Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a hired assassin. Not one of the best, or one of the most well known, but undeniably capable all the same. You have just succeeded in a brilliant assassination against a target requiring all of your many talents. This assassination was meant to secure your reputation, as well as paying you a small fortune; enough fortune to supply yourself with the many esoteric tools of the trade you need to succeed against the most powerful of targets. At the completion of your mission, you were however... betrayed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Left out to dry and with no chance of reward, you dodged the vengeful law and located enough clues to determine the name, and the location, of your treacherous employer. You have tracked him down to the darkest pit of villainy this world knows, Port Blacksand. Your ex-employer, your betrayer, doesn't realise you're on his trail. You don't care anymore about the money promised to you, although if you can acquire some of his it would only be justice. You do however intend to extract your vengeance upon him and, in doing so, recover what little you can of your tattered reputation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dusk is just falling and you're standing outside the gates to Port Blacksand. You smile a small smile of anticipation... this is going to be fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
