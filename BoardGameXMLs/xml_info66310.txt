			<description>The game centers on a 3-D tree with a plastic trunk and cardboard leaves. Each player gets 3 monkeys in their color (there are 12 monkeys total plus one black chimpanzee figure). Players roll dice to have their monkeys climb the tree via holes in the trunk. If a double is thrown, the player must place the chimpanzee figure a number of holes. Any monkeys the chimpanzee passes must return to the bottom of the tree and start over. The first player to get three monkeys to the top of the tree wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
