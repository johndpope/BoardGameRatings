							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1970s 2D6 RETRO RULES</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whilst Cepheus Engine is a sophisticated rules-set that seems able to cope with almost every eventuality, the rules for task resolution and combat that follow are directly inspired by the very first set of 2D6 SF roleplaying rules from 1977. They allow for much faster play, but at the cost of less detail. Use them as an option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unless specified here, use the weapon stats from Cepheus Engine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zozer Games&amp;rsquo; soon-to-be-released book HOSTILE is a science-fiction setting for Cepheus Engine that harkens back to the early 80s and late 70s, and so it seems fitting to offer the referee and players a set of roleplaying rules which do the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
