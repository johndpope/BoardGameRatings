							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Something Went Wrong (Free Edition)</name>
									
			<description>from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This refers to the Free edition: 13 pages in PDF format. It is the complete and playable game, presented with minimal formatting, no images and no character sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something Went Wrong is a new, simple and extremely fun competitive fantasy RPG in which things go wrong. Everyone&amp;rsquo;s the GM and no one is, but not all at once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of skilled adventurers go on one last adventure to secure their futures and fortunes. Something they&amp;rsquo;ve all done, any number of times. And then something goes wrong. Featuring almost 5 classes, literal tons of gold and monster knitting circles, you won&amp;rsquo;t want to miss out on this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The premise is simple! As experienced adventurers, your characters succeed at just about everything in game. The only exceptions are hitting monsters with weapons and hitting monsters with spells. For those, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns as the GM leading their group of characters through one or more encounters. Every round of each encounter features another player taking the roll of the GM. The goal? Use your experience to cause the other characters to fail spectacularly! The last character left standing wins all the loot and gets to brag about it at the local tavern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something Went Wrong is a quick game which can be played with zero preparation. All you&amp;rsquo;ll need are a d6, a d12, some paper and pencils and a good dose of humor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character creation takes roughly 5 minutes and a game can be  played over the course of an hour or two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
