			<description>Based on the popular game Crazy Eights, this lively card game delivers fast-paced fun while helping kids become aware of their unique and special qualities. Players draw, match, and shed cards, answering questions as they go. (For example: &amp;quot;Would you choose yourself as a friend? Why or why not?&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because only half of the cards include questions, the game moves along at a brisk pace. Special cards--Switch Direction, Leap, and Wild Cards--introduce an element of surprise. Players race to get rid of their cards and be first to proclaim &amp;quot;One of a Kind.&amp;quot; For added excitement, the rules provide a way for quick-thinking players to jump in at the last minute and keep the game alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each round of play, smiles abound--because kids are not only having fun but also feeling better about themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
