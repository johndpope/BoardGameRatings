			<description>&amp;quot;Modern Mythic Role Playing&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters are Eternals, mortals chosen by a Tempus to fight in the Eternal War (good versus evil). Character types include Sentinels (protectors and shepherds of humanity) and Defilers (with various evil goals).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The default setting is modern day Seattle. Rules (and emphasis) are given on running an Epilogue for characters who die, which includes the appropriate afterlife.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;So then I'm immortal?&amp;quot; Jade asked.&lt;br/&gt;  &amp;quot;I'm afraid not. You can die like any other human. The difference is that you've been set apart from the rest of humanity. Aided by the Tempus, your essence hides you from the prying eyes of mortals. Even as we speak, computers are losing your files. You will quickly find that if someone looks for you, you simply don't exist,&amp;quot; Covell answered.&lt;br/&gt;  &amp;quot;What about my job?&amp;quot; Jade asked.&lt;br/&gt;  &amp;quot;Most of the Eternals leave their jobs and their friends and family.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;  &amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot; Jade asked.&lt;br/&gt;  &amp;quot;The Eternals who chose the pah to the celestial become Sentinls. The Eternals that slide towards the nefarious become Defilers. The Defilers, and other Children of the Dark One, don't give a rat's ass about non-combatants.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;  &amp;quot;So what do these Sentinels do?&amp;quot; she asked.&lt;br/&gt;  &amp;quot;As the cracks widen in the Great Barrier, more Children of the Dark One escape from Hell to attack humanity.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;  &amp;quot;And the Defilers try to break down the Barrier, right?&amp;quot; Jade asked.&lt;br/&gt;  &amp;quot;I think you're starting to see the big picture.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
