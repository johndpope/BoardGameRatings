			<description>From the preface to the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This index is designated to help you find the information which you are looking for in the Gamescience Swords &amp; Glory, Vol 1 The T&amp;eacute;kumel Source Book: The World of the Petal Throne, Book 1 published in 1983. It indicates the sections and pages within the sections in which the word is located. Also, if a word or topic has more than one reference, the references which define the word of topic are followed by an asterisk (*). If you cannot find the word which you are looking for under the word itself, try looking under the associated topic, e.g. if you are looking for &amp;quot;Tn&amp;eacute;k,&amp;quot; try looking under &amp;quot;Ships.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the listing of words and topics, there is a listing under &amp;quot;L&amp;quot; called &amp;quot;List of.&amp;quot; This listing contains references to the lists of items found in the Source Book, such as the list of Emperors of the Second Imperium, to reduce the size of this index. If you cannot find a listing for what you are looking, try the &amp;quot;List of&amp;quot; listing. It just might direct you to what you are looking for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, at the back of the index we have included some of the more useful information for using the map and playing the game, and an updated version of the Table of Contents on the inside front cover with the page numbers listed for each section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, we at Tita's House of Games would like to thank you for your newfound or continued interest in the World of Tékumel. If you have any questions or do not have a copy of our current listing of available games, please let us know. We shall be happy to answer your questions and to send you a copy of our current listing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
