			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mega-City One is one of the craziest places on Earth to live. More than 400 million souls crammed into an already overpopulated city often causes tensions to flare and temperatures to rise. Unemployment is almost total in the Big Meg, with only one in ten citizens ever getting full-time employment at some time in their lives, leaving a bored populace with very little to do. It is very little wonder that many of the citizens in Mega-City One turn to pastimes and other activities to relieve the tedium of everyday life. Some pastimes are just fleeting fly-by-night affairs, popping up into the limelight and staying popular for a short time. The fun soon wears thin and the easily bored citizens move on to the next big thing. Other recreational pastimes are more concrete and can earn their creators vast sums of credits in royalties and patents, and will go on to become firmly lodged into the hearts and minds of the citizens of every sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From flying high at breakneck speeds on a powerboard, to soaring on thermal currents in a bat glider suit, to using cosmetics to make oneself hideously ugly, every craze has its highs., lows and devoted followers and it is these crazes that help make Mega-City One the place it is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Justice Department tries its very best to keep abreast of all the latest crazes that are sweeping the streets of its city. If it deems a craze is either too dangerous or liable to cause problems in the future, then it has the power to ban such a craze before it becomes too widespread.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, sometimes even banning a craze will not stop it from becoming popular and, for almost every craze cracked down upon by the judges, there are literally thousands: of followers of that craze who will keep it alive. So reluctantly the Justice Department will allow a great many of these pastimes to become popular and hope they will run their course and the fickle population of Mega-City One will snub them and move on to the next best thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rookie's Guide to Crazes&lt;br/&gt;This book is a detailed guide to the many pastimes and crazes that have become popular in Mega-City One over the years and their place in today&amp;rsquo;s Big Meg. It presents players with new skills, equipment, dozens of pastimes and kooky products that have swept the city. Games Masters will also find a wealth of background information to use in either citizen or judge campaigns. Though this book covers a great deal of the crazes that have appeared in both 2000AD and the Magazine, it is by no means the definitive guide to these pastimes and if it were to include everything mentioned this would be a tome of truly epic proportions. We encourage you to add to the crazes in this book, exploring the wonderful world of fads and pastimes in the craziest city on Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
