							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guerilla</name>
									
			<description>Guerilla is based on the confrontation between Malaysia and Indonesia from 1963 to 1966. It simulates at section and platoon level typical operations of an infantry battalion in the First Division (Province) of Sarawak during the first half of the period of operations . . . Although an accurate simulation of the type of operations and tactics used, Guerilla does not claim to be a precise historical simulation of any particular period or aspect of the war . . . The Orders of Battle do not have any historical basis, but again are typical of the forces engaged on both sides. On the Security Force side . . . the composition of the game battalion is based on the Gurkha organization, slightly modified to suit the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
