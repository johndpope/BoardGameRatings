			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawn from the Dark is an anthology of Call of Cthulhu (7th Edition) adventures from both the 1920s and Modern eras for  a varying number of investigators that can be played in a single evening or over several sessions.  The adventers can be played as one-off challenges or as part of a larger, on-going campaign. This third volume in the Tales of the Monolith constitutes the remainder of scenarios and other material for Call of Cthulhu, including one adventure and scenario seed that was previously published within Pagan Publishing's magazine, The Unspeakable Oath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenges within this tome range from the age of Lovecraft to mysteries of the modern. Investigators contend variously with horrors unleashed upon modern-day Boston, encounter conflicting cults seeking to acquire a dark artifact, investigate the mysterious disappearance of a foreign diplomat, and discover the secrets of a haunted house. Two additional scenario seeds are included for Keepers to exploit at the players' expense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
