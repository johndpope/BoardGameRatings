			<description>Billed as a &amp;quot;party&amp;quot; game, players are dealt various teams competing in a fictitious 32 team straight knockout rugby tournament.&lt;br/&gt;A die is rolled to determine in which of 6 countries the event will be held - which will benefit certain teams during the tournament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teams are rated as A, B, or C - and matchups are resolved by rolling one of five specially numbered dice per team, depending on the strength of the them and the opposition.  Winning a match gains the teams 'manager' a chip, which can be traded in for a 'penalty' token at certain times.  Playing a penalty token will add 3 points to your teams score in a match - allowing for a small amount of strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all the matches in a round are resolved, the remaining teams are reshuffled, and the next round played until the overall winner is determined - although rules are included for &amp;quot;buying&amp;quot; teams if all your own teams are knocked out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
