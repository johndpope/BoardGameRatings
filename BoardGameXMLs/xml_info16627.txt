							<name  sortindex="5">The Royle Family Game</name>
									
			<description>Based on the UK Television Series of the same name following the exploits of the Manchester couch potato Royle family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to answer trivia questions in order to collect Club biscuits.  You miss turns if &amp;quot;Dave buys you a pint in The Feathers&amp;quot; or if &amp;quot;Barbara puts the kettle on for a brew.......&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The  mechanics are simple dice based movement with card drawing.  Three decks of cards are used: Television Facts, Chance cards and the endearingly titled &amp;quot;My Arse&amp;quot; deck which takes it's name from Jim Royle's favourite saying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Believe it or not there is a special edition which comes with a novelty toilet seat cover with a picture of Jim Royle on it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
