			<description>French cycling game from the 1950's. Four teams of 4 cyclists representing the countries France, Switzerland, Italy &amp;amp; Germany fight for victory. The mechanics are a combination of die with a spinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was a promotion for the &amp;quot;M&amp;egrave;re Picon&amp;quot; cheese makers. Each cheese portion box included a cut-up rider and a bonus. If you sent 20 of these bonuses, you received the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
