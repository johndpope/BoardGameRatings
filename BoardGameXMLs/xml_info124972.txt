			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greetings, Space Agent! If you are reading this, you have been formally accepted into that most illustrious of organizations, the Space Patrol. Founded in Interplanetary Year 2930, the Space Patrol protects the many people of the solar system. Our motto is:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;rsquo;re here to help!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you ever forget, you need only look at your gleaming Space Agent badge. Everywhere you go, there are people (and other things) who need help, and it is the job of the Space Patrol to aid them wherever and whenever we can. Some people apply to become Space Agents thinking they&amp;rsquo;ll be flying through space zapping green bug-eyed aliens, but nothing could be further from the truth. Not only are most green bug-eyed aliens friendly, but little things are every bit as important as big ones. If you don&amp;rsquo;t like the idea of stopping to help get a cat out of a tree, this isn't the organization for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About This Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventures of the Space Patrol is a tabletop role-playing game for having fun, heartwarming, bold adventures with minimal preparation. As a player, you&amp;rsquo;ll become a Space Agent, one of the proud members of the Space Patrol&amp;rsquo;s Earth Branch, and help ordinary people with space-related problems. Along the way your Space Agent will make new friends and bravely work to solve the problem at hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
