							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Survivor (1987)</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A giant ship orbiting a decaying planet holds samples of thousands of lifeforms in hibernation. The builders of the ship, the mysterious beings called &amp;quot;the Masters&amp;quot; are feared and obeyed throughout the galaxy, and no one has ever had the courage to challenge them. But one day, a creature from an extinct species manages to escape from hibernation. Her goal, find ten suitable hosts for her offsprings among all the different lifeforms held in the ship and revive her species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survivor is a side-scrolling arcade exploration game where the player leads the Survivor, a deadly creature looking a lot like the Alien monster on her search for suitable hosts. The creature can travel inside the ship by walking, using teleporters or crawling through ventilation shafts. There are several species to be encountered in the ship, not all of them hostile. The creature can fight by spitting a corrosive acid (the player can adjust the range of the spitting attack by pressing the fire button longer), and can eat living creatures to replenish her energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
