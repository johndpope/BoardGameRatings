							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pocket Ungame: Teens</name>
									
			<description>This is the Teen version of Ungame. This set has new cards that are specifically designed for teens, their parents, and youth groups to get to know each other better and explore each other's feelings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 140 cards divided into two decks of 70 cards each. The first deck contains lighter questions such as, &amp;quot;If you were stranded on an island, whom would you like for a companion.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second deck is composed of more specific questions and deeper questions, for example, &amp;quot;Share your feelings about child abuse.&amp;quot;  That's heavy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns drawing cards and answering the questions on them in a few sentences. Most of the rules are considered as guidelines, such as the &amp;quot;hint&amp;quot; to keep your answers fairly short, but the Rule of Silence during another player's answer must be observed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with other games in the Ungame series, there is no winner or loser. The object of the game is to spend quality time with your family and learn more about the thought and feelings of those closest to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
