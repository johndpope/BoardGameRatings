							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SweatShop (2016)</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clicking away, you put together a sweatshop, installing desks, hiring workers, and giving upgrades to increase their productivity in making clothes.   As your business becomes lucrative, you can increase the speed of the walkers who gather in the clothes, increase the maximum number of clothes stored on desks, and even re-set the game with a bigger or faster work floor.   While still basically a light clicker game on a 20 or 40 space grid, there are strategic decisions that make it more of a hybrid with management games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
