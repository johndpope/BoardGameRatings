							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Red Shift (2nd Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Shift is a complete science-fiction roleplaying game system. It uses the Destiny Engine, a game engine that is used for all of Grendel Roleplaying&amp;rsquo;s core games. This allows you to use the characters you create in many different settings. Red Shift is designed to be playable by those who have never played a roleplaying game before, and yet still have the complexity that experienced players desire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic concept of Red Shift is that after approximately nine hundred years of exploration, colonization, and war, mankind has spread out into all of the star systems near Earth. The great colony ships set out to find new and better worlds than our poor Earth, and hopefully not to make the same mistake of destroying the ecosystem with pollution and war. Many of them were lost among the unforgiving stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players begin with Character Points which are spent to purchase things during (and after) character creation.  Most games will play with 100-150 Character Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters first buy Scores in the fifteen Attributes and then select a Race which will limit or enable future options.  Red Shift Lite supports only two races: Human and Rhyrha.  Characters next select a Profession which is somewhat like a &amp;quot;light-weight&amp;quot; class.  Professions have minimum Attribute requirements and also provide Skills, possible bonuses, and bonus equipment.  Characters have Talents and Advantages, as well as Disadvantages.  Some characters also have Psionics; some Professions require Psionic ability for entry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
