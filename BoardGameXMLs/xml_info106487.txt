			<description>Quantum Theory, (known in Japan as クウォンタム セオリー) is a third-person shooter video game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It is developed by Team Tachyon and published by Tecmo. The game was released in September 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game centers around two characters named Syd and Filena who must fight through a &amp;quot;living tower&amp;quot;. The game features a cover system that constantly adds and removes cover due to the tower being active.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in an organic sci-fi world, years have passed since a world war left the world in a catastrophic state, leaving only a few survivors. In a new community &amp;quot;Cocoon&amp;quot;, life has been threatened by a black material called Erosion, creating a post-apocalyptic environment. Surviving humans recruit a militia to conquer the Erosion and set out to take down the &amp;quot;Living Tower&amp;quot;. The main character, Syd, has only intentions to destroy the Tower. He meets Filena along the way, as they both ascend to the top in their search for answers. The tower is constantly eroding, and intensifies as the game progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Quantum (2010 video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
