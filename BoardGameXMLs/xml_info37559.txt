			<description>&amp;quot;Strategy Card and Board Game for 2 to 6+ players. It is the Warm Permian-Triassic period and primitive animals are just starting to colonize the landmass of Pangaea.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player controls one of ten &amp;quot;Basic Taxons&amp;quot; representing a group of prehistoric animals. Each Taxon has a special ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to have the most Victory Points after every Territory on the board is occupied at least one Animal Token. Victory Points are awarded at the end of the game based on the number of Animal Tokens a player has on the board, as well as the number of Territories occupied exclusively by the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
