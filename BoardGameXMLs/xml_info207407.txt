							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ELECTION! The Presidential Campaign Game</name>
									
			<description>A game of trivia, teamwork, &amp;amp; campaign strategy. Ages 10 and up, for 2-8 players.&lt;br/&gt;ELECTION! The Presidential Campaign Game&lt;br/&gt;2nd Edition&lt;br/&gt;Overview:&lt;br/&gt;Citizens vote to elect our president. In this game, you can lead the campaign! ELECTION! is a game of trivia, teamwork, &amp;amp; campaign strategy. Players compete to be the first party to claim the most electoral votes in an American Presidential election campaign. Players lead their party&amp;rsquo;s campaign for president by raising funds and purchasing Town Hall, Advertise, and Charisma cards to earn votes. Then with votes in hand, they strategically claim State's electoral votes and ensure their party's victory. Game Play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn involves three actions.&lt;br/&gt;1 Roll dice&lt;br/&gt;2 Buy Cards&lt;br/&gt;3 Claim States&lt;br/&gt;ACTION 1: Players can choose to roll the dice to raise funds. ACTION 2: They can opt to buy cards to build their campaign and earn popular votes. For example, buy a Town Hall trivia card to test your knowledge of history, State Capitals, State nicknames, and more. A correct response earns the votes. ACTION 3: With popular votes in hand, the players use them to win selected States on the score ballot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may also &amp;quot;endorse&amp;quot; a teammate after their three actions. This is done by forwarding cards to a teammate's hand, pooling cards and votes to claim more States during their turn. Can the party now claim enough electoral votes to win the election?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game progress is kept on the score ballot. The score ballot lists all 50 states and DC, and is sorted based on presidential election results from 1988 through 2008. There are states that lean red, states that lean blue, and swing states in the middle. States that lean toward the player's political party require fewer popular votes to claim. The swing states are equal for each party, and are more difficult for both. By claiming states with earned votes, players win electoral votes for their party and work toward victory. The electoral votes listed are current for the 2012, 2016, and 2020 presidential elections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
