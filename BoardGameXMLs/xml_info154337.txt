							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Drawing Blanks</name>
									
			<description>Drawing Blanks is a classic draw and guess featuring wildly inappropriate, unconventional, and suggestive cards.  In order to defeat the opposing team, and for lots of laughs, a player pulls a card and sketches onto the drawing surface while their teammates try to guess the outrageous, horrendous, or possibly despicable word on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game winning conditions are chosen by the players to allow for a range of game lengths.  Typically a score is picked and the first team to reach that score is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round consists of 60 seconds of drawing and guessing by one team, and if they are unsuccessful, the opposing team can steal the point.  If multiple teams are involved, the steal is round robin based on order of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck of drawing blanks are divided into 6 color-coded categories:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(RED) Fifty-Fifty: Tame or not.  Flip and find out.&lt;br/&gt;(GREEN) Modern Ways of Living:  Pop culture, demented &amp;amp; minus the culture.&lt;br/&gt;(ORANGE) Let's Talk About Sex:  Ok, let's.&lt;br/&gt;(BLUE) Things That Suck:  Think of things that suck.&lt;br/&gt;(WHITE) If You Know What I Mean:  *wink wink*&lt;br/&gt;(BROWN) You People:  What do you mean &amp;quot;you people&amp;quot;?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the rulebook are several variations to the basic rules that allow expanded playability to ensure the game can be replayed again and again.  The play types include drawing as many cards as possible in a 120 second round, collecting 3 of each category, and having your opponent draw three cards and decide what you have to draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
