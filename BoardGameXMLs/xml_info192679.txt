			<description>A game that trains logical thinking. The game can be played as a betting game on the truth of implications or just to be the first to find if an implication is correct or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example:&lt;br/&gt;A statement and an implication is selected:&lt;br/&gt;When Betty is reading a book she does not want to be disturbed.&lt;br/&gt;Betty does not read a book. Therefore she can be disturbed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the game material (logical matrix) you can prove that this implication is not correct: ((p --&amp;gt; -q) and -p) --&amp;gt; q&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the implication is revised in the following way, the implication is true ((p --&amp;gt; -q) and q) --&amp;gt; -p:&lt;br/&gt;When Betty is reading a book she does not want to be disturbed.&lt;br/&gt;Betty can be disturbed. Therefore she is not reading a book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game for true mathematical nerds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALSO makes you&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     fit in controlled thinking&lt;br/&gt;     precise in phrasing&lt;br/&gt;     invulnerable in discussing&lt;br/&gt;     excellent in solving brainteasers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALSO-players know the rules of precise thinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
