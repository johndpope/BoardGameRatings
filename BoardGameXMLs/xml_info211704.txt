			<description>WORLD AT WAR 85, VOLUME 5: STRIKE FORCE AFRICA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STRIKE FORCE AFRICA is the FIFTH volume in The WORLD AT WAR 85 SERIES of games of fast and furious platoon-level combat. The series is set in 1985, in an alternate history of World War III. With the Warsaw Pact armies deep into Western Europe, war zones are appearing around the world drawing away scarce U.S. ground reinforcements. The Soviet Union and its Cuban allies widen the scope of the war to Angola in southwest Africa, engaging rebel and as well as South African Defense Force troops fighting there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The WORLD AT WAR 85 system features a unique combat system that involves die rolls by both attacking units and defending units, which keeps both players engaged throughout the game. Die rolls are compared and hits applied quickly, as all the information you need to fight your units is on the counters. No combat results table is necessary. Initiative, formation activation, random turn length, close air support and air cover are all integrated smoothly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
