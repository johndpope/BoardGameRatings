							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dover Road Shooting Game</name>
									
			<description>Straightforward target game but with some flair for relating to the title. In the 18th century, coach travellers were often accosted by highwaymen and the Dover Road was a popular haunt, lying as it does between London and the port of Dover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The targets, in period dress, are the coach itself, one alarmed passenger, one passenger who has just been shot and the highwayman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gun is operated by a rubber band but just look at the appearance, as near as they could get to an 18th century pistol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the one with the most hits after the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
