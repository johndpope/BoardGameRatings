			<description>So this is a children's dexterity game in which the players' goal is to gather &amp;quot;asteroids&amp;quot; (marbles) into their bins.  There is a &amp;quot;Commander Kikeriki&amp;quot;, an anthropomorphic chicken astronaut, flying a spaceship in the middle.  He's the one that distributes the marbles, which are in the beginning placed on a sort of platform behind him. Each player's bin is connected to said centre through bars, and has a slider with a small receiver in between.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the game is turned on, the chicken begins to vibrate wildly, randomly opening up to let the marbles loose.  The players try to lift up their bin and slider in sync with this openings and try to collect marbles from the chicken.  Whoever has the most in the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
