They treat patients who arrive at the trauma center in critical condition and attempt to save their lives. This is a traditional tabletop RPG, with a gamemaster who creates a scenario for the players, while the players narrate their characters' decisions and actions. Experience with traditional tabletop RPGs, particularly for the gamemaster, is assumed by the authors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
