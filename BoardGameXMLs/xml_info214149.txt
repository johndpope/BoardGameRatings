							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Soul of Your Own</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this setting you are not of the Nobilis. Instead you are a kung fu hero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are still Imperators. There are still Excrucians. You cannot easily sort out one from the other. In this little corner of existence their mode of operation is the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They seek to own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are seven great gems that float in the sky between worlds. These are the stakes of the physical war. Fleets of demons and monsters swarm about them in constant battle. But in truth it is a sideshow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What both sides want is to find a single person &amp;mdash; somewhere in the world &amp;mdash; who they may turn from an endlessly transmigrating soul into a vehicle of their power. Someone who may lose their personhood and become instead an avatar, a Power or shard, a toy to the endless gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not a final victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One person won't decide it. Ten billion won't decide it. They are winning and losing such battles all the time, and they'll keep at it until the last soul is snatched up from the cycle of existence to become an angel or a bane. But it's what matters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They'll shed oceans of blood for a jewel; they have, they do, every now and then a hapless world floats into such an ocean and its people drown. But one person is more vital to them than all the floating jewels and stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One appropriately vulnerable person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such as you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
