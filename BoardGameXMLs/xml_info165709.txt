			<description>Squirrels are stocking on food supplies for the winter, but Ghiotto, the most gluttonous and lazy squirrel of the forest, goes from hole to hole to grab some acorn from other squirrels!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the funny tile game Ghiotto di Ghiande, players must choose each turn a bunch of nuts - without knowing how many leaves will be needed to cover it - or a group of leaves - without knowing how many nuts it contains - to stock on supplies before hibernation, avoiding carefully to drag Ghiotto's attention by having the biggest stack of leaves at the end of the turn. There are three types of nuts, and players will score only two, so... choose carefully!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
