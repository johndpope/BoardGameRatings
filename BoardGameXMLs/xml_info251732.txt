			<description>Uncertainty Principle is a quick-playing original abstract game played on an 8x8 grid board.  The starting position is an empty board.  The objective is to end the game with the most stones or markers of the player's color. The uncertainty principle demonstrated by game play is that a player may choose the location of their next move but not the type of piece played.  To play, players take turns designating a square they wish to occupy and rolling a die to determine if their color or that of their opponent is placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, players may place their marker on a square that is surrounded by enough of their color to &amp;quot;convert&amp;quot; spaces without rolling. An empty square adjacent both diagonally and orthogonally to three spaces of one color is in a &amp;quot;critical state&amp;quot; and if a fourth piece is placed adjacent, automatically converts to that color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successfully placing a piece may allow a series of neighboring spaces to be claimed. Strategy and risk are combined as players attempt to shape the board in their favor, while at risk of seeing their opponent benefit instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
