							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Insurgency</name>
									
			<description>Insurgency covers the first two years in Iraq following the ground campaign in 2003, as the American-led Coalition attempts to quell armed Iraqi resistance. American, British and multi-national military units are presented on a brigade level. Insurgency combines stratagems, a hexagonal grid map, and a unique city grid system to highlight the importance of urban centers in Iraqi guerrilla uprising. The Coalition player can invest resources in troop increases, infrastructure rebuilding or act to reach political solutions.  Meanwhile, the Insurgent player seeks to unify guerrilla factions, while waging a war of attrition on Coalition forces. Each game play is unpredictable, and explores numerous scenarios with the introduction of randomly-drawn stratagems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
