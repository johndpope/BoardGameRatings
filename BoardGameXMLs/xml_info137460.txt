							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Empires Collide</name>
									
			<description>Empires Collide is a turn based strategy board game pitting emperors against each other to dominate the known world - once a peaceful place ruled by one house until a bitter civil war tore through the nation leaving in its wake several self governed cities. Having isolated themselves from the trauma's of war for many years, each player controls one city in its attempt to expand and reunite the empire with an iron fist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the box players will receive&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Maps for 2, 3 and 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;1 board with space for detachable maps.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;1 Spinner.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Over 200 creature cards with 51 unique designs.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Over 20 spell cards of 10 different varieties.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;20 sided dice (ten in number).&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Four deck holders containing stat recorders - to assist players in knowing the strengths and weaknesses of their empire, and that of their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;6 General Cards, acting as battling cue cards and providing each emperor with a different ability to assist their strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;4 economic cue cards to assist players.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Over 60 event and knowledge cards with 40 unique designs, to bring an element of chance to every game.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Sixteen plastic army pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Over 90 plastic buildings featuring 12 unique and detailed designs.&lt;br/&gt;100 notes depicting different values of Florins, the in-game currency for Empires Collide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts in their Capital, with a single unit of troops, represented by their army piece. The decision ever facing a great ruler is &amp;lsquo;to expand&amp;hellip;.or not to expand&amp;rsquo;. Players receive florins each turn depending on the number of economic structures the player has constructed. With these florins the Emperor may train creature cards for use in battle, purchase spells from the cities universities, or save for larger upgrades. Once the Emperor has decided on his strategy he must venture forth and take on the world. Villages will be built, towns forged from the ashes of civilization and magical creatures tamed and sent forth to fight for your cause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sound strategy is not everything however. Each turn the players must use the spinner, which may lead to an event or knowledge card being drawn. Event Cards can be both a benefit or a burden, whilst Knowledge Cards may recover lost tomes and technologies leading to a mightier empire. Size is not everything!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player ventures into an opponents defended province they must battle for control of the land. The size of a players Empire determines the extent of the army that can be fielded, whilst knowledge uncovered may provide an extra boost to your military prowess. The battle itself is a card game based, with the troops you can field being determined by the might of your Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
