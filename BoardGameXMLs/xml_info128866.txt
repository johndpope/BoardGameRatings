			<description>user comment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't Rest Your Hooves is a fan-made supplment for the psychological roleplaying game Don't Rest Your Head, adapting the My Little Pony setting to the RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;One thought was all it took, that day. The day you looked down at your pristine hooves, at the colorful-but-glassy eyes and hollow grins of the Ponies around you. The day you asked the question that started all of this. Maybe it was &amp;quot;why am I here?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;how does this all work?&amp;quot; or even &amp;quot;What am I doing this for?&amp;quot; but what it did was open your eyes. It made you realize something terrible, something awful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In this paradise, where all needs are taken care of, where everything is beautiful and just, and everything is just so saccharine... in this paradise, you simply aren't happy to just go along with things anymore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;That's when you started to notice things. The way all the other Ponies just drifted without a paying attention to the world, trotting like zombies. The way things always seem to work out for the better and go back to they way they were as if the problem never happened in the first place. The world operates on a disconnect with reality that you can't help but find ultimately disconcerting. Stuff seems to happen not because it should or because it makes sense but because it ought to, and you seem to be the only Pony that finds this troubling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Voicing these worries to your fellow Ponies got you nothing but confusion and concern... and the vague feeling that maybe you'd be better off forgetting about these little delusions of yours and rejoining the herd.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
