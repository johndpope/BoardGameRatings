			<description>A Trick Taking Game of Winning Cat Friends and Cat Fights&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play offering cards of different values and houses to earn a range of blessings from the Houses of Elder Cats across multiple seasons&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each season you will strategically play your 5 blessing cards, play one per round, to earn better rewards or deny your rivals resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of a season, new offering cards are dealt, repeating the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use these offering cards to secure Lesser and Crown Blessings from the Houses of the Elder Cats to stock your Fiefdom with food, entice wild cats to your Fiefdom's Court, increase your share of Catnip, and gift your food stocks to wild cats to turn them loyal to your fiefdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Newly recruited cats can offer significant powers to your fiefdom. Other cats can add new powers when are fed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use your newly fed loyal cats to &amp;quot;trump&amp;quot; your opponent's offerings or fight off your opponent's cats to secure your reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to feed 3 wild cats and make them loyal to his/her fiefdom wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTES: Offering Cards are now Mini Sized! - not Micro as depicted and also now all cards and player spaces include texture and uv coating!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
