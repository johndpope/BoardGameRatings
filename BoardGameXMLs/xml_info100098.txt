			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A real-time strategy game with a single player campaign and the option to play skirmish matches against up to 5 players or computer players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warlords: Battlecry has some RPG elements in it, as each army will have a Hero who you can level up between battles, gaining skills and professions.  Each profession has several specializations, allowing for many different end game abilities.  There are eight different schools of magic that your hero can learn spells from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are nine different races, each fighting better under certain conditions and with somewhat different tech trees and building dependencies.  Resources come from mines which automatically generate resources, but must be converted by your hero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All units can gain experience and levels in this game, as opposed to just the hero.  Any units that earn high levels can also be brought into a new map along with the hero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
