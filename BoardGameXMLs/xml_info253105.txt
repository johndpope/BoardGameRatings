			<description>In NLT (No Later Than), all players have three Blokus-like tridimensional pieces: a N, a L and a T. Each round, a card is drawn, indicating a top, a front and a side view, as well as two of the three pieces. The object of the game is to use the two pieces indicated in order to build a structure matching the three views. Whoever is the first to build the structure takes the card, which is worth one point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends as soon as a player has 4 points. They are declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
