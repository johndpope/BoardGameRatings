			<description>The game consists of an outer circular board that has a rotating inner circle. The inner circle has some sci fi graphics and along its edges it has the alphabet and letter blends. Rotating the inner circle helps players makes words using the outer circular board.&lt;br/&gt;The starting player turns the outer circle 5 combinations to randomly select a letter combination (i.e eep). the player then uses the inner circle of letters and blends to try and make as many words possible (i.e Keep or sheep). For each correct letter- sound combination players receive 5 points. Penalties of 10 points apply for any omitted words or incorrect words. &lt;br/&gt;Players take turns until 5 sound combinations are completed. The player with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;The game is really to help children learn to read and spell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
