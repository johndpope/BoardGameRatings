							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Under Construction</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thurn, an evil dwarven cleric, has taken over construction of a suitable temple to his evil god(ess). The temple is being carved into the side of a limestone cliff, on the site of an existing cave. Thurn despises his goblin workers and often takes his frustrations out on them. He would gladly replace them with almost anything else, including skeletons or captured adventurers. Between Thurn&amp;rsquo;s management technique and an increasing sense that this project is cursed, morale among the goblins is exceptionally low and they are generally terrified of Thurn and his growing skeleton force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
