							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fringe Fauna</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beasts of the earth, air, and water. Not even your druid knows these creatures... yet! Need to populate a world with creatures and want it a bit alien? Want your druid or ranger to have an animal companion no one has ever seen before? Need a mount that's never been in a stable? How about a familiar that's not so familiar?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fringe Fauna is 59 pages of brand new animals. There's no monsters here, just 50 animals that don't exist in the real world. Also included are lists for animal companions (for druids and rangers), familiars, and mounts utilizing the animals in this book. Finally, the book wraps it all up by wilderness encounter and CR. Every animal is illustrated in black and white and has a page to itself (and a few are on two).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
