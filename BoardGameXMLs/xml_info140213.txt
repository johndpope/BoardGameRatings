			<description>Before the game begins each player customizes several of the cards with names of family members, friends, pets etc. in Mad Libs Criss Cross Game. Then each player picks nine cards from the card tray and puts them onto their card holder (3 Nouns, 3 Verbs and 3 Misc.). The first player lays down a sentence made of cards and counts up the total score which is printed on the individual cards. The next player lays down a sentence crossing over or adding to the previous sentence and adds up the score. When all of the cards are used or no one else can make a sentence the game is over. Object of the Game: The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
