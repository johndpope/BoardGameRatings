			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dice Dungeon is a race to be the first to find a route through a perilous dungeon. A brave adventurer, you will encounter monsters from terrible dragons guarding hoards of gold to pesky little orcs, ancient, undiscovered treasure chambers, cursed glyphs. Lots of stuff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you explore you also come across the items you need to get through and learn spells that can alter the very corridors in front of you. But beware; you are not the only one in the dungeon and your opponent will have a very different view of what it looks like&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You begin the game with an empty grid of thirty-six square holes (the Dungeon Waffle), plus a bag of thirty-six Dungeoneering Dice. The Dungeon Waffle is placed between you and your opponent, so each of you can see a different side of it. You then take it in turns to draw a die from the bag, roll it and use whatever you roll to either add to the dungeon map, alter the dungeon map or add to your resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your aim is to score more experience points than your opponent over one or more games. During a game you try to map out a route on your side of the waffle from one edge to the other, and collect weapons and equipment to deal with whatever you might encounter on the way. When adding to the dungeon map you will change the map seen on both sides of the Dungeon Waffle, hopefully helping your route, while hindering your opponent&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
