			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nestled deep in the Black Forest of Bavaria lay the town of Shoental. Although the villagers worked hard, the village remained in poverty, because the domination of the dragon Gruenaugen. Gruenaugen demanded half of all goods produced by the village, or the villagers would face destruction from the dragon's wrath. Many a young lad had set forth to slay the dragon, never to return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The young town miller (der Mueller) spent many hours thinking about the plight of his town. He knew that previous attempts to destroy the dragon by force had been fruitless. He also knew that Gruenaugen loved games, as all dragons feel they are intellectually superior. He invented a game that only the cleverest would win and confronted the dragon with a deal: freedom of the village if der Mueller won, or enslavement of der Mueller if Gruenaugen won. Gruenaugen, feeling he was superior, naturally accepted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Der Mueller facest the hardest test of his life but overwhelmed the dragon with his strategy and won. Der Mueller returned to the village a hero. Gruenaugen was never seen again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A strategy game for two players. The object of the game is to capture 5 of your opponent's gems. Each player starts with 8 gems and tries to complete trios to capture theur opponent's gems by placing their gems on the board during phase one, sliding their gems during phase two, and picking up and moving their gems during phase three.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-Implements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nine Men's Morris&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
