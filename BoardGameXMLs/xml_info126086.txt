							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Final Exam</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You have one final test to complete your education,&amp;quot; your instructor tells you. &amp;quot;All those who train in Cormac's School of Wizardry, also known as the Cedar Coral Wizards Guild, must learn to use their training in a very real way. We don't just send you out in the world with a pat on the backside and hope for the best; we want you to be truly prepared.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's been a long fifteen years. You know how to channel the magical force known as &amp;quot;kremm,&amp;quot; to manipulate it to your will, and to use it to change the world around you. It's time to move on with your life. It's time to prove to the world that you are worthy of the title, &amp;quot;wizard.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But before you step foot outside the great halls of the Wizards Guild, you must pass the Final Exam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I survived this dungeon myself, many years ago,&amp;quot; he continues. &amp;quot;Though it has seen many changes, it is still very challenging - and very deadly. You will need more than just your magic. You will need to be smart, clever, and lucky. Less than half of our students survive.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you willing to risk your life and put your training to the test?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Final Exam is a Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls Solitaire Dungeon designed specifically for T&amp;amp;T 7.5e. Including the additional spells in the Codex Incantatem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
