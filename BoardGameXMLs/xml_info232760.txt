			<description>Well... There&amp;rsquo;s this fella that&amp;rsquo;s into games, so into games that he brushes Contra aside without losing a life, knows exactly where the secret passages are and where the loot is stashed without even phoning a hint line... A man from another time... A time before every gamer tried to be a stream celebrity, before every gamer could shout on a forum about how they knew better than the guys who made their favorite games in the first place, a time when gaming was about gaming (and sitting glued to the screen during Summer holidays)... This is a story about a gamer lost in modern times. His name is Jeff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elsewhere, beyond the realm of the real world, is a lonely place at the edge of the Pixelverse. A dumping ground for the Nobody-folk who were almost somebody - but have long lost their dreams at a drinking hole in the middle of the desert, in the middle of nowhere. Little did they know is that all they needed was a hero... Sadly, considering the nature of forgotten places, no such hero ever came by, so they&amp;rsquo;ll have to settle on a gamer instead. Jeff finds himself warped into a world full of forgotten game creations. A place packed with all the Player 3&amp;rsquo;s that nearly hit the big time, didn&amp;rsquo;t and then got on with it...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
