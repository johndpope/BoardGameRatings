							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hypertalk Scripting</name>
									
			<description>The learners will be able to write simple HyperTalk scripts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must build coherent sequences of cards into HyperTalk scripts. This is similar to a straight in the card game &amp;quot;Rummy&amp;quot;. Cards are marked with individual HyperTalk commands such as &amp;quot;On MouseUp&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;visual dissolve&amp;quot;. A dealer gives each players 10 cards from a deck of 60. The dealer places the rest of the deck face down, with the top card turned face up to begin the discard stack. The players take turns choosing either a card from the deck, the top discard, or the entire discard stack. The first player to use all of their cards to build coherent scripts, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;60 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
