			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A collection of 30 nautical NPCs both naval and piratical!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pirate Codex brings you 30 nautical enemies and allies from CR 1 to 16, covering a great cross-section of interesting builds and different twists on classical pirate archetypes. You'll find everything from rough-necked renegades to magical mariners, with artillerists, marines, navigators, and more suited for campaigns from the savage coasts on into the golden age of sail. Each NPC has brief suggestions for its use, with robustly detailed stat blocks that provide a ton of inspiration for throwing them into the fray against your heroes. The Pirate Codex is an ideal resource for the busy GM who wants a set of ready-made stat blocks incorporating a wide variety of rules elements, pushing the boundaries of the fantastic yet still keeping the focus on the people that make your pirate campaign go, from fellow freebooters to rival raiders and your naval nemeses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick up the Pirate Codex today to spice up any sea voyage in your Pathfinder Roleplaying Game campaign, and check out the rest of our series of Pirate Adventure Path Plug-Ins, like the Islands of Plunder adventures, Treasury of the Fleet, and Nautical Heroes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 34-page product is the latest in the Pirate Adventure Path Plug-Ins line from Legendary Games. Like every product from Legendary Games, it is designed by many of the same authors that bring you the official Pathfinder rules you already use, as well as many of the authors that worked on the official Pathfinder pirate-themed AP (issues #55-60). We hope you will check out other products in our Pathfinder AP Plug-Ins line, including the Islands of Plunder series of adventures, and we hope that every product you buy from us helps Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
