							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Computer Statis Pro Baseball</name>
									
			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The software in this package contains the names and real-life performance characteristics of actual major league players. Use the stats of the teams supplied or you can design your own real-life or imaginary teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once loaded, you will be able to display entire rosters of professional teams...you will be able to select each team's lineup...you will be able to substitute...you will be able to effect the same strategies of real-life managers...in short, through the magic of computer technology, you can re-create an entire baseball season, a championship series, or a world series in a game based on real-life player statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A feat not possible before the advent of the microprocessor, Avalon Hill has computer analyzed season-long statistics for each player's hitting, fielding, pitching, base-stealing, bunting, game-winning hits, even stamina...converting it all to &amp;quot;computer memory&amp;quot;...your guarantee that each player should perform in this game just as he does in real life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, YOU have a lot to say in this matter...YOUR natural ability at managing might make an also-ran a pennant winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a microcomputer version of Avalon Hill/Sports Illustrated's best selling sports board game of the same name. Computer Statis Pro Baseball utilizes the same statistical information and fast action system that has made the board game version the best seller that it is. In the computer version, results are instantaneous...and you don't have to remember any rules or look up results on a myriad of charts. The computer does it all for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great for Both Solitaire and Head-to-Head Play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You do not play against the computer. You can, however, play against yourself with the computer doing all the bookkeeping. Or you can play against another live opponent who, thanks to the large core of memory, can select lineups, effect player changes, and make all the strategy moves he deems fitting for the occasion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have selected the desired teams and placed them in memory, the computer will display complete rosters of both teams. You then key in lineups and the game is ready to run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A half inning can take only as long as it takes you to press the space bar three times (a one-two-three inning). It plays that fast! But you can elect to employ any and all strategic ploys an actual manager has at his disposal anytime you want. The computer keeps track of batting order, runs, hits, outs...everything, in fact, that you would get in an actual box score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, at the conclusion, the display will print &amp;quot;GAME OVER&amp;quot;, and a complete box score showing everything that happened, even to accumulating season-long stats. (For owners of a printer, this game will even give you the complete box score on a print out sheet.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
