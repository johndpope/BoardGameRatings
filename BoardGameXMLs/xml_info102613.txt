			<description>Go &amp;amp; move was developed under a project of the German Economy in Cologne. It is purely a board game without computer assistance. It should give pupils a hands-on introduction to the business world. The goal is to inspire these young people for the economy, to lead them in mind as representing diverse economic decisions for entrepreneurs can be. It is primarily for school lessons in the region of North Rhine Westphalia thought. Thus it can not be ordered or purchased outside of this region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players assume the role of owners of printing companies. They are advertising for their business, acquire orders that regulate the number of employees, advertise for public orders. They always have to make sure that the orders are fulfilled on time.&lt;br/&gt;A particularly interesting element is that, the pupils, beyond the basic rules, can arrange their own ways of dealing with the taks: by making arrangements, joint ventures and transmission of orders. The game length is variable. The game ends immediately when a company becomes insolvent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
