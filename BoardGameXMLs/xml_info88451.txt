If you're right, the pretty hostess will turn the letters. Do you want to take a shot at guessing the puzzle, or do you want to run up the score?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get set to spin, get set to win - the Wheel of Fortune Family Edition is hours of fun for the whole family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
