							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sheep Happens</name>
									
			<description>Sheep Happens is a look into a ridiculous world where incredibly dumb sheep will have to figure out how to save themselves from the angriest, craziest, and most bizarre goats you've ever seen. A card game where you need to steal and imprison enemy players sheep, using powerful and dumb goats to attack them, while you defend yours. Defend from your opponents attacks placing fences in front of your sheep, using traps or scrolls from your hand and If you have any goat cards in your hand, attack your opponents in order to capture as many sheep as you can. Each captured sheep is worth one point, and the first player to reach seven, five or three points, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
