			<description>A Bandersnatch is a 3D figure with feet, a body, a tail and a nose. To win the players are trying to build Bandersnatch in rounds as in Cootie. But there are a couple of twists to the simpler game of Cootie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win a chance on getting a body part the player must win a spinner. The catch is that there is one less spinner than there are players. So in each round one player won't get a chance to obtain a Bandersnatch part.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players all grab for a spinner when any player builds a hand of 4 cards of the same color. So there is an action/dexterity element to the game too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play begins with dealing 4 cards to each player. On a signal of go from the dealer all players look at their cards. If no one has four of a kind then each player passes card card face down to player on left. Again on go player pick up card and dtermine if they have four of a kind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
