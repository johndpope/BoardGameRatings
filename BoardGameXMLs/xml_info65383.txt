							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gambit Złotego Króla</name>
									
			<description>Translated publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;'Gambit Złotego Kr&amp;oacute;la' is an adventure kept in the vein of a dark crime story, verging on horror. It's a big challenge for both the players and the Game Master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are thrown into the middle of a dangerous, lethal game taking place over a certain special game of chess. Five sides fighting for their own interests and almost thirty Non-Player Characters create a vivid background, which - if the players are not careful - will consume them and smash them like cloth dolls. The scenario starts at a ball organised by dutchess Harpburn. When the chatter is disturbed by a horrible scream of one of the guests, it will be a sign that the subtle thread of cynazian intrigues and games has just been broken. With each passing moment it will consume more people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Gambit Złotego Kr&amp;oacute;la' is a ruthless adventure, not slowing down before indecisive, helpless players. It is lethal, as much as cynazian intrigues are.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
