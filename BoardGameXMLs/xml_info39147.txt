			<description>Slacker is a card-based game where players try to get through the work day doing as little work as possible!  Cards include Workload (which you try to force on other players), Excuses (to avoid doing the work),and Time Cards (which move the clock towards 5pm).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the cover:  Play Slacker, the only game where you can tell your boss it's against your religion to answer the phones.  The game where you win by doing the least.  Slacker... Tell your boss the things you've only dreamed of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
