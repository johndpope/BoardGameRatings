			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Best at What They Do...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...and what they do isn't very pretty. Go back to the grim days of the 1980s and '90s, when super-vigilantes in leather and chains dispensed harsh justice on the mean streets. Iron Age looks at the darkest era of comic book history and how you can bring it to life in your Mutants &amp;amp; Masterminds game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this book you'll find a history of the Iron Age of comics, an overview of the period, how to create and run Iron Age characters and games, and much more, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Heroes! Ten new ready-to-play hero archetypes, including the Vigilante, the Ninja, the Demon of Vengeance, and the Gun-Toting Mutant from the Future!&lt;br/&gt;     Villains! Eight new deadly villain archetypes to threaten your Iron Age heroes, each with two or more adventure hooks to play. They include the Crime Boss, the Evil Ninja, the Supernatural Menace, and the Metahuman Dictator.&lt;br/&gt;     Freedom City! Details on the Iron Age of Green Ronin's award-winning Freedom City campaign setting. Go up against the corrupt Moore administration, meet up with the vigilantes of FORCE Ops, and take on the worst criminal scum in the city, from the crime lord Augustus Roman to the Fearsome and RIOT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron Age also features the adventure Bad Medicine; get your series started with a bang as the heroes take on drug-pushers, the Mob, sinister mega-corporations and the menace of RIOT!&lt;br/&gt;Iron Age is a shotgun blast of super-powered crime, betrayal, and vengeance. It ain't pretty, but someone has to clean up the streets. So the only question is...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...Do You Feel Lucky, Bub?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
