							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Police Surgeon</name>
									
			<description>The players each take the part of a Police Surgeon and attempt to help people in trouble at various points on the board.  Each successful arrival at an emergency earns the Police Surgeon points and the first to accumulate 100 points wins.  Game strategy involves gathering the most points while taking into consideration distance to the emergencies, their point value and the likelihood of the emergency cards being returned to the deck.  3 emergency cards are always face up, but one is exchanged from the deck when players land on a red dot.  Green Fate spaces require a player to draw a Fate card and follow directions, but may be held to use at an appropriate time if indicated on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on a syndicated TV show from 1970's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
