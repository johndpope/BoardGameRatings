			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Dragonstar adventure for four 6th-level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saergin Thunderclaw, a half-dragon of blue dragon descent, is something of a rabble-rouser. He has never really accepted that the blue dragons will have to wait for the red dragons to finish their 1000 year Red Age before the blue dragons can take what Saergin sees as their rightful place at the head of the Dragon Empire. The kingdom of Asamet was founded and led by a blue dragon, yet they have been forced to play second fiddle to the red dragons in the Dragon Empire. This did not sit well with Saergin, so he began fomenting a movement to displace the red dragons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
