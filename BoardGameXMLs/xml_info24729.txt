							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tesseract</name>
									
			<description>This game has a 16x16 game board, but the playing pieces move on the 15x15 intersections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second and third row on each side of the board are the player's home sections, the space between is neutral. Each player has 6 &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; playing pieces (1 tesseract, 1 cylinder, 1 pyramid, 1 rectangle, 2 stars), 2 large slide bars, 5 small slide bars and 2 crosses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start, each player places the Tesseract, the pyramid, one star and 2 small slide bars in his section. Then the 2 crosses are placed in the neutral zone. These crosses cannot be moved and remain at their position until the end of the game. The remaining pieces: the cylinder, the rectangle, one star and 5 slide bars form the reserves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players now move their pieces over the board or place a piece from their reserves everywhere on the board. Object of the game is to either capture the opposing tesseract or capture all other &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; pieces of the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The movements of the playing pieces different for every type. Interesting, that slide bars can capture normal pieces, but cannot be captured themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
