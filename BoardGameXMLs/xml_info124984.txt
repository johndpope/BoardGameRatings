							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster Girls in Love</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has sexual stuff, and is for mature adults with open minds. If you&amp;rsquo;re not one of those, get the fuck out. Seriously. This stuff is not just for gratification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway. In this game you play a monster girl, which is to say a monster from a fantasy world (in more ways than one) who is improbably attractive to and physically compatible with human men. Over the course of the game your monster girl will have encounters (and not in the 4th Edition sense) in which she may eat, copulate with, get raped by, become pregnant from, or possibly even fall in love with human male adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is very threatening (on purpose), so much so that it will probably go unplayed. If you do actually play it, sit down and talk with the other players about what you are and aren&amp;rsquo;t cool with. And check their IDs while you&amp;rsquo;re at it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
