			<description>Little League World Series Baseball 2009 is a video game developed by Japanese developer Now Production (NowPro). The game begins when a player is taken to a main menu. They there can choose several different options, including World Series mode, exhibition mode and minigames. In World Series mode, a player chooses one of the 16 different regions, and tries to reach the Little League World Series by making it through regionals, pool play, then winning in the playoffs. In the Exhibition mode, a player can pit any two teams in the game against each other for a faster, less-complicated experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Little League World Series Baseball&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
