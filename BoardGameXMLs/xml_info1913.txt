			<description>Transsib (later Published by Winsome) is a game about mafia gangs selling goods during a journey on the Transsiberian Railway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board depicts the Transsiberian Railway and a few of the stations along it - starting at Irkusk and ending in Moscow. There is also a picture of 6 green passenger cars and one restaurant car, and finally there is a table which lists all the goods and the value of each at each of the different stations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to sell your goods for the highest profit you can while keeping your mobsters alive and thwarting your opponents from selling their goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game each player gets 12 goods cards which must be placed in that player's compartments in the railway train. During the game if you sell a good of that type you remove the corresponding good card from one of your compartments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided into moving rounds (2 in between each station) and selling rounds (when the train is at a station). During a moving round a player can move one of his mobsters, steal an item from another player, seek protection money from another player which may lead to a duel, or attack another player's mobster (the loser in a duel or attack is removed from the train).&lt;br/&gt;During a selling round, a player may sell items from a train car that contains one of his mobsters. Sold good cards are removed from the game and protection money is paid if owed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the train reaches Moscow and the final selling round is done. The player with the most money wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
