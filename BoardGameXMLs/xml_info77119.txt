			<description>The Commodore 128 (also referred to as the C128, CBM 128, C=128) home/personal computer was the last 8-bit machine commercially released by Commodore Business Machines (CBM). Introduced in January 1985 at the CES in Las Vegas, it appeared three years after its predecessor, the bestselling Commodore 64.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The C128 was a significantly expanded successor to the C64 and unlike the earlier Commodore Plus/4, nearly full compatibility with the C64 was retained, in both hardware and software. The new machine featured 128 kB of RAM, in two 64 kB banks and an 80-column RGBI video output (driven by the 8563 VDC chip with 16 kB dedicated video RAM), as well as a substantially redesigned case and keyboard. Also included was a Zilog Z80 CPU which allowed the C128 to run CP/M, as an alternate to the usual Commodore BASIC environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Commodore 128&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
