			<description>Brilliance is a strategic card game in which players try to earn the most points by earning and selling gems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play a card on the table to form groups of gems. Take a gem for every group you form. When you sell gems, the price you get is equal to the largest group of that gem on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the game continues, the values of gems fluctuate, so you want to sell when the price is high. Just don't wait too long! One skillful play by an opponent can drastically reduce the price of your favorite gem!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
