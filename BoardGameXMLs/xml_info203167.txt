			<description>Back cover blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rory's Drift is a Traveller one-shot scenario for 1-5 players. Designed to be played in a single session, the PCs find themselves recalled to duty by the Scouting service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's time to go back to the Kellin system that was recently returned to the Imperium after the Aslan invasion. The party are reactivated by the Scouting service to make a preliminary investigation of the Scout base in Kellin. With a rogue group of Aslan unwilling to leave, pirates operating in the system, and the Imperium administration trying to execute a cover-up, things will not be straight forward for our intrepid party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
