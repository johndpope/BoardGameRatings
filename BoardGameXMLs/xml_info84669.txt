							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Boogie SuperStar</name>
									
			<description>Like the original game, Boogie Superstar features both singing and dancing. The game is based around the premise of a talent contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The karaoke gameplay is similar to other singing games such as SingStar and Karaoke Revolution. To score, the player must sing in time and in tune with the lyrics as they scroll at the bottom of the screen, with a musical staff to indicate the correct pitch and where the player's current pitch is. Rather than using phonetic detection, the game bases the score on how well the player matches the rhythm and pitch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In contrast to the freestyle dancing in the last game, the game mechanic in Boogie Superstar involves players waggling the Wii Remote to simple two-beat prompts, such as swinging the Remote side-to side or up and down in time to on screen directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Boogie Superstar,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
