							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Catch the Leader</name>
									
			<description>The game features of Toby Twirl and his chums. Toby Twirl was a Pig with human hands and feet and he appeared in books by Sheila Hodgetts between 1946 and 1958. His image was illustrated by Edward Jeffrey. This game is from one of hthe Toby Twirl Adventures books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;An exciting game for a number of players. Choose one player as Leader, the rest being Runners. Use a dice for scoring and counters or buttons for players. The Leader has first throw; a six entitles anyone to an extra throw. Don&amp;rsquo;t wait for a six to commence. If a Runner catches up to, or passes, the Leader, he or she wins and takes the place of the Leader next round. If the Leader reaches home without being caught he or she is the winner and the next player in turn is the Leader for the following round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
