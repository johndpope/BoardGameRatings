			<description>Cats love treats, but these kittens are somewhat selective and prefer to eat only certain colors of treats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Katz &amp;amp; Schmaus, players need to try to feed the cats the right treats, but they see these treats only at the beginning of their turn, after which they're hidden. Someone attempts to assign a treat to the proper cat by shaking the game boxes. If someone thinks that a cat is getting the wrong treat, though, they can grab the cat figure from the center of the table to call out the shaker and have them open the box. If the doubter was right, they receive the treat as a reward, but otherwise the shaker collects the treat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the end, whoever collects the most delicious treats wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
