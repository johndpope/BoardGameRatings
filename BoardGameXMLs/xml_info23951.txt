			<description>From the box:  &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Head on baseball,  an audio cassette boardgame is a whole new ballgame! You are the manager.  You make the key decisions and a radio announcer calls the play by plays.  It's real baseball strategy,  with the excitement of hearing the highlights broadcast on the air.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 2 player game that roughly simulates a game of Baseball. There are 30 batter cards (15 each team) and 24 pitcher cards (12 per team).&lt;br/&gt;The cards have a red tinted window that line up 'decoder style' to reveal the outcome of the at bat.  Periodically the outcome will be &amp;quot;xx tape xx&amp;quot; which means to activate the audio cassette tape included and listen to the &amp;quot;play by play action&amp;quot;. The announcer will then tell you the outcome of the play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules suggest not rewinding the cassette tape until reaching the end of the tape, thus keeping some level of randomness.  There are about 200 calls on the tape prerecorded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
