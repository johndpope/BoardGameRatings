			<description>The players will be able to put together numerous combinations of fractions that add up to &amp;quot;one&amp;quot;. In the process they must be able to recognize the values of various fractions (i.e., that 1/2 is larger than 1/4), know fraction equivalents (i.e., 1/4+1/4=1/2 and that 2/4=1/2, etc.), and know the various combinations of fractions that add up to ONE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to acquire the most points by collecting sets of fraction cards that add up to &amp;quot;one&amp;quot;. The more cards used to add up to &amp;quot;one,&amp;quot; the more the set is worth. &lt;br/&gt;The sets are awarded points as follows: one card (such as 2/2) = 1 pt., two cards=5 pts., three cards=10 pts., four cards=15 pts., five or more cards=20 pts. Points for the sets are added up, and the player with the most points is declared the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;52 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
