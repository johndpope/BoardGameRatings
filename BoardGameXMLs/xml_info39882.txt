			<description>Each child takes the role of the little elephant Willi trying to blow the dandelions around the meadow. Who would like to help Willi to collect as many dandelions as possible in order to let them dance in the wind?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have to collect the most flowers from the board. Each player gets a card which shows the color they have to collect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the board flower cards are put randomly. A player at his turn may blow a small ball over the board. When the player gets it between four flowertiles he may take all the flower tiles in his color. When the ball ends on a flower he can take one of his flowers from anywhere on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player that collects all his flowers first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
