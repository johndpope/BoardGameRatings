			<description>&amp;quot;Satisfactory&amp;quot; is a card game that bring the best and worst parts of &amp;quot;White Collar Work&amp;quot; into an interactive card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player manages a hand of cards consisting of &amp;quot;Hours&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Ladders&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Back-Stabbing&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Special&amp;quot; cards. On each turn you pay &amp;quot;hours&amp;quot; to place down &amp;quot;ladder&amp;quot; cards trying to climb the corporate ladder to the top. Beware though, as other players can spend their hours to play &amp;quot;Back-stabbing cards trying to either demote your or take credit for your work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8 random &amp;quot;CEO&amp;quot; cards alter the game dynamics by creating changes and effects to all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round is considered a week of work, and after 8 weeks the game is over. The &amp;quot;Worker&amp;quot; with the most Ladder Points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a NON collectible game for 2-6 players for fast paced card action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
