							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Holy Grail</name>
									
			<description>The Holy Grail is a highly strategic card game where players take turns drawing and playing cards until someone wins the game by whittling down their hand so the only card they're holding is the holy grail itself. The deck is made up of action cards that let you steal cards like the grail from other players, force your opponents to pick up multiple card and shuffle up everyone's hands to name a few.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game gets more and more intense as each player battles it out to be the one in possession of the grail, all the time trying to work out how to get rid of the rest of their hand without the grail eluding their grasp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
