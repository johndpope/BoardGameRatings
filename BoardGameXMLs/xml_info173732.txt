							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anything To Declare?: The International Game of Smuggling and Detection</name>
									
			<description>You are the owner of a shipping line required to unload containers in a port, and move around the board collecting cargoes for delivery to a warehouse.  As well as this, you must control movements of your lorry and also use your own customs security piece to follow and challenge containers carried by other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bluff element in the game centres around decisions on whether to pay premiums to insure cargoes moving through the docks, and once at the lorry park you must decide whether to declare goods for payment or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategy elements include decisions on which piece you will move on each turn, or whether you use you throw to hire a forklift or crane.  The detection element involves guessing whether all your opponents are as innocent as they pretend or if they are not declaring their full cargo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
