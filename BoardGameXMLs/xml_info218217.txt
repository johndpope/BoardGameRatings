							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Amherst Turfgrass Management</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Massachusetts/Amherst has developed a seminar roleplaying course to enhance student learning regarding plant pathology and turfgrass diseases.  The course is offered for credit, meeting once a week for a roleplaying session.  Students are seeking accredited degrees in turfgrass management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The roleplaying is directed by the course instructor.  Typical activities involve one student assuming roles such as golf course superintendent, greens committee member, lawn care manager, or irate home owner.  Scenarios typically focus on problems of turfgrass management caused by pathogens or pests.  Outcomes depend largely upon student &amp;quot;meta-knowledge&amp;quot; of turfgrass management and pathology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
