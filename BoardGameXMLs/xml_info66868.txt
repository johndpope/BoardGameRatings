							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Ratgirls Need Our Boys!</name>
									
			<description>A not-quite-24 hour RPG, inspired by the &amp;quot;Ronnies&amp;quot; game design event.  From the opening:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;We all remember when the Drozan Empire attacked our world. A predatory alternate universe filled with a seemingly endless variety of Creatures, things that caused many to lose their faith and to believe that Lovecraft got it all right, things with powers simply too much for us to deal with. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a fight so much as a half-hearted resistance, as they took over our world and made it their playground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;But then, just as our backs were broken, they came. In spaceships of every size, javelin- and disc-shaped, they flew out with powers beyond our understanding. They fought back the Drozan Empire and put out the fires, propping humanity back on its feet. And then... they put themselves at our mercy. They called themselves the Trizgt, and they needed a place to rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In Space Ratgirls Need Our Boys!, you play two teenaged characters: a Trizgt space warrior, and a regular unpowered human. They are a couple (for the time being).  You will alternate between the two roles as the action goes on; the ratgirl exists to take the physical damage and do physical actions, and their human better halves exist to take emotional damage and take social actions. This may take place as a series of cuts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The central action of the game will take place in Local City High School (or, optionally, Local City University), where the Trizgt have decided to move in. Your clique consists of the PCs of you and the other players - Trizgt and the people they choose to go out with make a fairly exclusive club, and they tend not to work well as a group with other groups (although individual members may have dual memberships).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
