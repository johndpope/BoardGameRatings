			<description>&amp;quot;Metro 2033 is an action-oriented video game with a combination of survival horror, and first-person shooter elements. The game is based on the novel Metro 2033 by Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky. It was developed by 4A Games  in Ukraine  and released in March 2010 for the Xbox 360  and Microsoft Windows. In March 2009, 4A Games announced a partnership with Glukhovsky to collaborate on the game.  The game was announced a few months later at the 2009 Games Convention in Leipzig; a first trailer came along with the announcement.When the game was announced, it had the subtitle The Last Refuge  but this subtitle is no longer being used by THQ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played from the perspective of a character named Artyom. The story takes place in post-apocalyptic Moscow, mostly inside the metro system where the player's character was raised (he was born before the war, in an unharmed city), but occasionally the player has to go above ground on certain missions and scavenge for valuables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's locations reflect the dark atmosphere of real metro tunnels, albeit in a more sinister and bizarre fashion. Strange phenomena and noises are frequent, and mostly the player has to rely only on their flashlight to find their way around in otherwise total darkness. Even more lethal is the surface, as it is severely irradiated and a gas mask must be worn at all times due to the toxic air. Water can often be contaminated as well, and short contacts can damage the player, or even kill outright.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Metro_2033,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
