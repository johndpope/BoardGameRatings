			<description>Paper-and-pencil game where from 2 to 4 players using pencils of different colours must throw a die and write the thrown values on an 8x8 board, forming numbers that will be scored when a row or column has been totally filled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In their turn, a player must throw a die and write the value on one square of an 8x8 board, as far from the side of the board as the value shown in the die (1 is the border and so on). The value can be written as a first digit (tens) or as a second digit (units) in a number. The round ends when a row or column of the board has been filled up with numbers, all having a second digit and at least one having a first digit. Players will then score the numbers in the row or column that are fully in their colour; it's possible to &amp;quot;share&amp;quot; numbers but they won't score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A whole game consists of several rounds: three for three players and four for two or four players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
