			<description>Alpha-Bus is an alphabet learning game for young children. The board is shaped like a bus and consists of an outer track of spaces marked with the letters of the alphabet in order. Inside the track are spaces where tiles with each of the letters printed on them are placed face-down. Each player rolls the die and moves their piece along the track. When they land on a letter, they choose a face-down tile of the same color. If the letter matches, they must say the name of the letter and then may roll again. If the letter does not match or they misidentify it, their turn is over. The first player to reach the end of the track wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is two-sided. On one side, players must match upper-case with upper-case letters. On the other side, a more difficult match between lower-case and upper case is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
