							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Darkness Beneath Dalentown</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    An infernal horde of oozes, undead, transmutated dwarf lords, and even more horrifying foes await!&lt;br/&gt;    A mid- to high-level adventure featuring a detailed town and four dungeon levels.&lt;br/&gt;    Detailed town and dungeon maps, full monster stats, new magic items and dozens of hours of entertainment!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Darkness Beneath Dalentown is a Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry adventure for characters of levels 8-12 that takes a party of adventurers below the surface of Dalentown to investigate a long-abandoned dwarven stronghold. But that's where the familiar tropes end! Spurred by stories of restless spirits, the party soon finds themselves staring down an invading force of oozes, slimes, puddings, and jellies all in the service of demons! Worse still, the ancient dwarven lords that once protected this underground library and mining operation have been horribly transfigured by the infernal powers at work, and linger on as deadly spirits and automated guardians who are tortured by their station and forced to repel the intrepid adventurers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module features a fully realized town setting -- Dalentown -- complete with maps, developed NPCs, and above-ground intrigues. In the sewers -- also mapped out -- are the beginnings of the town's troubles, and four levels of dungeons connect to the sewers to create a sprawling dungeon crawl and a threat that could destroy Dalentown completely...by turning its inhabitants into mindless slime zombies! Tons of advice, sidebars, random encounter tables, and other random table generators give Referees the tools to run this adventure as a standalone event, as part of a bigger campaign, or to tear it apart into its component bits and leverage them as tools for their own homebrew campaigns. All maps are built with DM and PC versions, hiding any secrets, and are optimized for easy use in virtual tabletop programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
