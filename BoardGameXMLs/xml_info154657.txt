							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Angry Birds: Star Wars â€“ Jenga Bespin Battle Game</name>
									
			<description>This is another game based on the popular angry birds app.  This is a Target exclusive game that includes a Han Solo bird, Boba Fett pig, Stormtrooper pig, Millennium Falcon launcher, 8 full jenga blocks, and 3 half blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is designed for 1-2 players age 8 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player builds the structure and the other player launches his bird attempting to knock down the pigs and the entire structure.  This player keeps count of the number of shots taken.  Once the entire structure has been knocked down the roles are reversed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player that required the fewest number of shots to destroy the structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
