			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Derelict, you are a Space Marine detailed to protect a science team. This team has discovered an artifact orbiting Taurus III, a distant planet located millions of light years from Earth. Initially, there was no sign of anything wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The artifact changed that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You watch, horrified, as the scientists you swore to protect quickly turn into the stuff of nightmares. The infected crewmembers grow massive scythe-like claws where their arms used to be, razor sharp fangs in place of teeth, and horns now protrude through the skin all over their tortured bodies. These poor souls now only have a singular mission: kill anything in their path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the last healthy human aboard, you need to focus on surviving long enough to get the hell out of here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Derelict is a game for 2-5 players divided into two asymmetrical teams. One player is the human, tasked with restoring the derelict space ship to working order and escaping an untimely end. The other team plays as the infested, who make up the remainder of the players, and have only one goal: kill the human player at all costs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
