							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battlestandard Ancient Rules</name>
									
			<description>A set of miniature wargame rules for the Ancient period, encompassing early Greeks through Norman Conquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Battlestandard&amp;quot; was designed as a moderate-complexity treatment of Ancient warfare fitting between some recent, simpler Ancients systems and the highly detailed systems that have been hobby staples for many years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basing system is compatible with most existing Ancients rule systems, allowing players to use these rules without changing already-based armies.  Army lists are provided for Philippian/Alexandran Macedonian; Late Achaemenid Persian; Roman Marian/Caesarian; Celtic/Gallic Barbarian; Norman Conquest; and Late Saxon armies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn sequence is determined through an initiative system.  Armor and Shield protection is key to defining defensive capabilities.  Multiple categories of mounted, infantry and missile troops are distinguished.  Leadership is represented through several tiers of Leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is primarily geared for 25/28mm figures.  Conversion instructions are included for 15mm and 40mm armies.  Armies usually compose from 100 to 300 figures per side; the standard system figure ratio is 1?40.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Army statistics, including General characteristics, War Machine attributes and Army List Templates are recorded on copies of forms provided with the rules.  Referral to these lists suffice for determining combat and morale outcomes in a game. Games featuring armies of this size can be completed in three to four hours once the system is understood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher website: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.battlestandard.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.battlestandard.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
