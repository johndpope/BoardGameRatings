							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fateful Concepts: Character Aspects</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;When Spirit of the Century came out at the end of 2006, I became an instant fan of it and Fate overall. In the last eight years, I&amp;rsquo;ve watched many people experiment with the system, trying all sorts of hacks, some which have since become in a sense canonical Fate rules. Other experiments were successful in a different way&amp;mdash;not because they worked, but because they spurred conversation that helped our community better understand Fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collection of articles is part of that spirit of understanding and experimentation. It&amp;rsquo;s not a rules update so much as a compilation of findings and explanations that have evolved over the years&amp;mdash;both as a long-time fan and also working as Leonard Balsera&amp;rsquo;s co-conspirator on The Dresden Files Roleplaying Game and Fate Core System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this collection, I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on some character creation and character aspect topics. These are a hybrid of designer&amp;rsquo;s notes and thought experiments, which you are welcome to integrate and remix into your Fate publications. Some of these thoughts come from posts on my blog (RyanMacklin.com), which have been expanded based on comments and questions I&amp;rsquo;ve received since they were posted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
