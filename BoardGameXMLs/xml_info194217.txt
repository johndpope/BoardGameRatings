			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microlite81 Complete is based on the Basic and Expert boxed sets of the world's most popular fantasy roleplaying game published in 1981. It covers the same material as the standard edition of Microlite81 but includes more detailed descriptions of spells, monsters, and magic items and a few extras like examples of play anf GM advice which will hopefully make the game more friendly to players with less experience with old school gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microlite81 Complete includes everything one needs to play except dice and paper. The 128 page illustrated rulebook includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Simple Character Creation Rules: Roll 4 attributes and select a class, and alignment (and background if using the Extended Rules Set).&lt;br/&gt;    Standard Classes: Fighter, Magic-User, Cleric, Thief, Dwarf, Elf, Halfling&lt;br/&gt;    Two sets of &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; rules: standard and extended. The standard rules are less complex while the extended rules incorporate many of the author's house rules)&lt;br/&gt;    Extended rules include backgrounds which provide a simple and fast way to factor in a character's culture and non-class-*related a abilities.&lt;br/&gt;    Simple and fast-playing combat system -- that tracks physical damage (aka body points) separately from luck/skill/fatigue (aka hit point) damage if the extended rules are used.&lt;br/&gt;    Hit points recover with a night&amp;rsquo;s rest. Spells cost hit points to cast. Actual wounds recover more slowly.&lt;br/&gt;    Rules for hirelings, monster reactions (not every monster wants to fight), morale (not every monster fights to the death), strongholds, magic research, and more.&lt;br/&gt;    Optional rules for advantages and disadvantages, character goals and personality traits, fire-and-forget magic, traditional saving throws, psionics, divine intervention, and more&lt;br/&gt;    A complete list of spells, monsters, and treasure with detailed descriptions and random tables for monsters and treasure..&lt;br/&gt;    Compatible with most other B/X or BECMI based games and adventures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
