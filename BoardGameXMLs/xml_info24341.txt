							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Troy</name>
									
			<description>For 2 to 4 players played on the intersections of the board where the winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game the players men are called Sheckles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With all of the Sheckle belonging to all of the players you play with as many Sheckles as you like to make a set, then play with as many sets as you like to build your armies. Troy is played in &amp;lsquo;waves&amp;rsquo;, with points scored by catch-trapping Sheckles that are &amp;lsquo;in-play&amp;rsquo; which, if not saved, make up that players next wave; So although saving is not obligatory you&amp;rsquo;ll soon regret it if you don't! Enjoy. Recommended Ages 9+&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
