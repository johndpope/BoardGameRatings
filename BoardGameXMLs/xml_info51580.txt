			<description>The game &amp;quot;board&amp;quot; is made of plastic, with a riverbed twisting amongst several islands. To set up, fill the riverbed with water, place a sailboat on one end, and give each player their tikis, a straw, and a random card which shows either 6 or 8 gems. Place all gems in the bag and draw a random group of 6. The tikis have symbols on their bottoms meaning either take a gem from the display, take a gem from another player, or give a gem away. Players place one of their tikis on each of the islands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, roll the die until you roll a symbol for an island on which you have a tiki (or water; pick an island). Then, sail the boat to that island by blowing through the straw into the sail. You are trying to stop exactly at the pier. Meanwhile, the other players are taking turns rolling the die; if they roll the same island, your turn ends immediately! If you reach your destination, take your tiki and follow its instructions. If you took a gem from the display, replace it randomly from the bag. If you collected all the gems on your card, reveal it and place the gems there; they may no longer be stolen from you! Then, draw a second card. If that was your 5th tiki, replace all the tiki onto the islands at the start of your next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect all gems on 2 cards wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
