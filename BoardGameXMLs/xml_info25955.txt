							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pedal Power</name>
									
			<description>This game was released in England and is part of a small range of compact games that are quick to play (Quikky Games). Pedal Power is a cycling game in a compact plastic box that can pop open with the game rules and board appearing on the inside of the plastic box (being part of the packaging). This gives the impression that this is a traveling game. The closed box measures 23x13cms. Each player receives 1 colored counter (available colors are red, yellow, white and blue). There are also 4 dice in two colors (red &amp;amp; blue) but the dice don't contain the traditional 1 to 6 numbers but range from 0 to 4 and also includes a cross on one side. The gameboard is a cycling track in an oval shape. Different kind of races can be played on the track: sprint, time trial, chase, keirin or a points race. The mechanism is purely rolling dice thus the luck factor is rather high here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
