			<description>Hoard is an action strategy game that combines elements of a dual-stick shooter with those of a real-time strategy game. Each player controls a dragon that has the ability to fly, breathe fire, and perform several special abilities with the help of powerups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core mode of the game, called &amp;ldquo;Treasure&amp;rdquo;, challenges the player to collect as much gold as possible over a 10 minute period. Gold is earned in a variety of ways, the simplest being to use fire breath to destroy merchant wagons or buildings and then pick up the treasure chests that appear. Dragons have a limited carrying capacity, so from time to time the player must return to his hoard and deposit the gold there.&lt;br/&gt;When certain key thresholds of gold have been collected at the hoard the dragon &amp;ldquo;levels up&amp;rdquo; and is awarded with upgrade points which can be distributed amongst four key abilities: speed, fire breath, carrying, and armor. Upgrading each item improves the dragon&amp;rsquo;s abilities, which can have a major affect on game strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to destroying things for gold, the player can earn gold in other ways such as kidnapping princesses for ransom, capturing wizard gems, and scaring villages into offering tribute. The player can also steal gold from other dragons and their hoards.&lt;br/&gt;Treasure mode is the main mode of the game with over 20 maps available. Other modes include Princess Rush (be the first to ransom 15 princesses), Hoard (survival), and Co-Op Treasure mode (all dragons share a hoard and work together).&lt;br/&gt;Hoard supports 4 players at a time, working competitively or co-operatively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global leaderboards are present in the PlayStation 3 version and will be in the PC (Steam) version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Hoard (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
