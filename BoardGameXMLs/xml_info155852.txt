			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do Battle with the Most Powerful Undead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forsaking life for an eternal existence as a lich, these powerful spellcasting undead seek only one thing: power. Considered the vilest of blasphemes, those that would seek to become a lich do so at the cost of their own lives. For what is one life in exchange for an eternity of knowledge and endless pursuit of power? The only thing that stands in the way of these immortal warlocks is the courage and skill of your player characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this PDF, you'll find a number of options for player characters preparing to take on a lich. Options like the True Channel feat, which allows the power of the gods to blast away even the most resilient lich, or the mace of destruction, a powerful weapon that can turn a lich to dust. In addition, there are a wide variety of new rules for the Game Master to power up these undead tyrants. You can obliterate your characters with the black blade spell or keep them guessing with the blackfrost lich, capable of freezing the blood in their veins!  Game Masters will also find plenty of new lich feats, magic items, and adventure hooks inside. In total, this PDF contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     4 New Feats&lt;br/&gt;     4 New Alchemical Items&lt;br/&gt;     5 New Spells&lt;br/&gt;     5 New Magic Items&lt;br/&gt;     3 New Types of Lich&lt;br/&gt;     3 Adventure Hooks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
