							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">101 Fantasy Style Riddles II</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;101 all new riddles! J.R.R. Tolkien's book &amp;quot;The Hobbit&amp;quot; had riddles. The &amp;quot;Princess Bride&amp;quot; had riddles. Even Monty Python's &amp;quot;Quest for the Holy Grail&amp;quot; spoofed riddles. They are an entertaining and educational way to pass the time. They are great for parties, barbecues, family get-togethers, and campouts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As far as role-playing is concerned, this book is designed for Game Masters who wish to challenge their characters minds as well as swords. Many monsters love to ask and answer riddles. (Especially dragons.) NPCs may ask riddles to test an adventurer's worthiness. Magic doors and chests may offer riddles as a way to grant access and/or avoid traps. The possibilities are endless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Riddles in this book vary in difficulty from very easy to fairly difficult. Most riddles are in singsong rhyme similar to that used by Tolkien in his book &amp;quot;The Hobbit.&amp;quot; All riddles in this book refer only to subjects found in typical medieval/fantasy realms and are suitable for thinkers of all ages. This book specifically includes subjects such as mythological monsters, animals, gods, and magic items, as well as some abstract notions and/or mundane medieval items that a fantasy-style bard might pick as a subject for a riddle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a special bonus, this book includes a bardic test. Would you make a good bard, and/or problem solver? Take the test and find out. Depending on the number of riddles you answer correctly you may rank any where between animal intelligence/orcish bard to master bard, or even become &amp;quot;The Riddle Master,&amp;quot; most people will fall some where inbetween.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
