			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are lord of house during Victorian England, and must, during six rounds, build up noble fame by having a staff of maids, important connections and land strips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, a number of cards (maids, noble connections and lands) are laid out, and each player has 2 pawns that he may use to claim cards. Knocking away another player from a card costs money that goes into the treasury; and the treasury can also be claimed. Lands cost money to claim, but brings an income each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 3rd and the 6th round there is a scoring round, in which players get points for maids, combinations thereof, noble connections and land. The player with the most points at the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
