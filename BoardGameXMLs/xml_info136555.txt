							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Magnetic Soccer</name>
									
			<description>Magnetic Soccer is an European-exclusive Game Boy video game that was released in 1992; the concept of the game is based on the board game of table soccer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;Each team has eight players (one goalkeeper, two attackers/defenders, and three midfielders). When the player moves a row, all of them are moved at once unlike on an actual table soccer set. Rows cannot be moved in an upward or a downward position; only from left to right. Stopping the ball and performing powerful shots is only one aspect of the game. Players can also incapacitate one of the opposing players on a well-timed shot. A tied game results in a penalty shootout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three different surfaces are available. Players can practice without a computer opponent and a spectator mode allows newcomers to see two computer-controller opponents face off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Magnetic Soccer&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
