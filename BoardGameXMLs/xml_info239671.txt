			<description>Mythica: Fate of Heroes  is a hybrid adventure game incorporating elements of economic, tactical, RPG, and cooperative games.  Players take control of a single character (many drawn from the Mythica movie series from Utah-based Arrowstorm Entertainment) and endeavor to acquire Legacy points while building up their personal strength for the inevitable showdown with the big baddie of whatever plot you choose to play (the core game includes three plots). Players must work together to defeat the Nemesis in order to have an opportunity to tally individual Legacy and declare a winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this game's development was to provide an experience familiar to tabletop RPG players yet accessible to conventional board gamers. The world and plots draw heavily from the Mythica movie universe, but familiarity with that universe is not required to enjoy or master the game. A time-keeping mechanic makes the game progressively more difficult and rewards or punishes characters for how aggressively they choose to manage world events rather than build their personal strength. Ultimately the game is a balancing act between selfless v. selfish choices and cooperative v. competitive strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are optional advanced rules for more challenging and sophisticated game behaviors and rules for single or double play as well. At least two expansion packs are planned for more plot lines and additions to all play decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
