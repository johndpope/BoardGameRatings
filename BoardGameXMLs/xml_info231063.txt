			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten years ago, Daxo murdered his beloved older brother, Baldr. Exiled by his father for his crime, he's spent a long decade wandering. But now he's heard that his dear grandfather has died, and he's returned home to claim his inheritance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inheritance tells the tale of two families coming to terms with forgiveness, debt, religion, law and death. In three acts, the game presents a powerful drama that is always unique to the players and their decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a roleplaying game for nine players (no more, no less) and one facilitator. It takes place in two rooms (or a similar location outside) over two to three hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
