							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">My Friends Tigger &amp; Pooh Word Builder Game</name>
									
			<description>The game consists of a number of interlockable game pieces, each with two or three connection points.  The pieces are double sided, with one side to be used for younger children and the other side to be used with older children.  The side for younger players contains pictures of Disney characters.  The side for older players contains word fragments that can be matched up to form words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with the same number of game pieces, and an additional piece is laid in the center of the play area.  Starting with the youngest player, each player in turn links a piece from their hand to a piece already in play.  If a player is not able play, that player draws a piece from the supply of unused pieces, and may play the new piece if able.  In either case, play then passes to the next player.  The first player to run out of game pieces is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
