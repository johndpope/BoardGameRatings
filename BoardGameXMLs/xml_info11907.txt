			<description>HIGH RISK ! captures all the feel of international struggle - political, economic, military - and translates it into an exciting, realistic and very playable simulation that puts you at the helm of State! Assuming the role of both national leader and representative of a world ideology, you strive with other players for global domination, compete for scarce resources, make (or break!) treaties, mobilize for war or become an industrial giant! Countless opportunities - and threats - confront you and challenge your skill as a diplomat, economist and general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIGH RISK ! is for those who aren't afraid to play for big stakes! Whether through negotiation, bluff, treachery or just sheer force, you've got to beat the odds and the competition in order to rise to the position of WORLD LEADER!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic version includes a 24x36 4 color map, over 500 plastic counters, 3 types of playing cards and various other player aids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
