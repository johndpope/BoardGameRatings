			<description>Take a gameboard for each player and put the counters in a pile where everyone can reach them.  Start the tape at any point on either side.  Listen carefully to the tongue twisters.  When you hear a toungue twister that matches one of the pictures on your board, cover that picture with a counter.  The winner is the first player to cover all their pictures with counters.  For a more challenging game, turn the boards over and match the tongue twisters to the right letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
