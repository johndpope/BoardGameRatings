			<description>Why the long face? is a face charades game that brings taxidermied faces to life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why the long face? has been a delight for players of all ages and is fun for kids, parties, and waking your face up in the morning. With this fresh deck, you'll be face to face with the animals from the L. C. Bates Museum in Maine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kickstarter funded a print run large enough to supply everyone who has expressed interest with a deck full of dour addaxes, snarling coyotes, and quizzical squirrels. Each set of Why the long face? includes a deck of cards, die, and mat to lay out the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, the acting player secretly rolls a die, which corresponds to one of six animal faces. They have to try and replicate the face on the card, and the other players will attempt to guess which animal they are emulating in order to earn a point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
