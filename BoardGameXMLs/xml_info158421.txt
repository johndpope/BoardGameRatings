			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hey &amp;ndash; aren&amp;rsquo;t these the same as your Untold Encounters? &lt;br/&gt;Yes and no. While they are very similar to our line of Untold Encounters, A &amp;quot;Brawl in a Box&amp;quot; is merely one ongoing title in our long line of Untold Campaign Conversion Products. Because Untold is so flexible, we can easily adapt one product into another; our line of &amp;quot;Brawl in a Box&amp;quot; products are yet another way we are able to show that!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what are they? &lt;br/&gt;Basically, a &amp;quot;Brawl in a Box&amp;quot; is an M&amp;amp;M3E product that utilizes concepts, characters, and setting information from the &amp;quot;default&amp;quot; Untold Campaign Setting: Splintered Serenity &amp;trade;. We take our races, creatures and monsters, convert them to the M&amp;amp;M3E Open Rule-set and you&amp;rsquo;ve got a complete &amp;quot;mini-adventure&amp;quot; that&amp;rsquo;s self-contained and ready to go! Each &amp;quot;Brawl in a Box&amp;quot; contains everything you need to run the adventure &amp;ndash; the map, (or at least a sample map and a link to the excellent SkeletonKey Games map product), how to construct the battlefield, the setup, and all of the creatures (fully stated into M&amp;amp;M3e format) that you&amp;rsquo;ll need, plus counters! Use it as a random encounter, use it as an adventure hook, or even as a climatic final fight &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s up to you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brawl in a Box #1&lt;br/&gt;NAU High-bred, led by a heroic NAU HERo Sergeant must pit their equipment, intellect and abilities against a slavering horde of tentacled, diabolical, mind-devouring beasts from Beyond as they invade a Flux Horror Hive! Which side will you be on? Who will survive and be claimed the victor of Brawl in a Box #1! Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Seven (7) new NAU/Military-style M&amp;amp;M3e Minions, fully stated and ready to play: Grunt, Grenaider, Firebug, Sniper, HERo Sergeant, War Dog, Cavalry&lt;br/&gt;     Six (6) new, never-before-seen &amp;quot;Cthulhuesque&amp;quot; Flux Horror M&amp;amp;M3e Minions, fully stated and ready to play: Corrupter, Flux Warper, Hydra Strand, Rift Ripper, Shardthrower, Wrecker&lt;br/&gt;     Full color tiles/tokens for each new Minion&lt;br/&gt;     Complete Background, Setup, Movement and Hazards rules needed to run the encounter&lt;br/&gt;     Complete instructions for building the SkeletonKey Games map contained in Skeleton Key Games Tiles: e-Adventure Tiles: Cave Passages&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
