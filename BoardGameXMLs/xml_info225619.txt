			<description>In this deliciously gooey card game, you&amp;rsquo;ll build (or rebuild as needed) your body from a severed head, equip yourself with a motley collection of weapons and armor, and eventually behead the Chief of the Zombie Nest to take over leadership and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a zombie, losing your head doesn&amp;rsquo;t kill you, but it sure can put a damper on your day. It&amp;rsquo;ll take time to forage and scavenge enough material to build a new body, but you&amp;rsquo;re determined to do it. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll get lucky and find some useful tools, maybe even a weapon or two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not going to be easy, because the other Players are all trying to do the same thing. Will you be lucky enough to find the chainsaw and the shotgun? Will some other zombie trick you at the last second into walking into helicopter blades? There&amp;rsquo;s only one way to find out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regardless, you&amp;rsquo;re not the kind of zombie that&amp;rsquo;s going to let a little beheading get between you and your ultimate goal: to rule the Zombie Tribe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
