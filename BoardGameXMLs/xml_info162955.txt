							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cat Girls of Black Japan</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nekomusume are cats in the form of a girl, playful seductive and innocent. They are creatures of magic and supernatural crossbreeding, of gene-cutting and cosmetic surgery. They are an artificial species, a common but none the less stunning sight walking Black Tokyo&amp;rsquo;s streets. Seeing one, your breath catches in your throat for a moment, amazed the world can be so full of beauty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nekomusume were (at least initially) an artificially created female species- a pretty status symbol and plaything for the rich and decadent. The first breed of Nekomusume entered the market during the early 1980s. Initially, Neko ownership was the ultimate status symbol along with stretch limousines and private helicopters, and the uber-rich remain the most common owners of humanoid cats to this day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prices eventually fell, as the magi-tech wombs used to breed catgirls themselves became cheaper and more common. Today, with special financing plans, bulk purchase discounts and the occasional clearance on used or less prestigious bloodlines put catgirl ownership within reach of the middle class&amp;hellip; at least if they&amp;rsquo;re willing to sacrifice much for the joy of owning a felinoid. Thanks to cunning marketing campaigns and saturation advertising, many are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The catlike humanoids can breed true, despite the arcane and hormonal locks on their reproduction, and can produce litters of free Nekomusume. Many integrate into human society, using their natural gifts to disappear into lucrative careers in Black Tokyo&amp;rsquo;s sex industry. Others fight to free their enslaved mothers and sisters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some cities, packs of feral, genetically inferior Nekomusume are common pests: creatures with nearly-human bodies but animal souls. Feral Nekomusume are the exception: in the main, these felinoids are almost as intelligent and cunning as their human fathers&amp;hellip;despite what their masters and marketing brochures claim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
