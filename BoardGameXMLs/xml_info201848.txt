			<description>From the booklet:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program draws a clock and places a man halfway up a ladder. The program asks &amp;quot;what time is it?&amp;quot;. If the child answers correctly, then then man climbs two steps up the ladder. When an answer is wrong, then the man goes down a step. The program tells the child what was wrong and gives the child another go. If the second try is wrong, then the program shows the correct answer. When the child obtains enough correct answers for the man to reach the top, he dances a jig at the top and plants a flag. Each time he gets to the top he earns another flag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program has three stages for telling the time. The first stage introduces the hour hand, the second the minute hand and the third stage combines the two. Having learnt to tell the time, the program provides three similar stages to enable children to set the clock, in each case helping children when an incorrect answer is entered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a very simple educational game. In addition to the gameplay as presented to the child described above, the teacher or parent has the ability to access additional data, including where the child entered wrong answers and how long they took to answer the different questions. This purpose of this is to enable the teacher or parent to identify problem areas where the child may need additional help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
