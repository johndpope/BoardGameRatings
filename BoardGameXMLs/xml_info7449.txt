			<description>Box blurb: &amp;quot;Fast paced and exciting. An electronic football game that tests your football knowledge.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A smaller format version of the earlier &amp;quot;computer&amp;quot; sports games by Electronic Data Controls Corporation (EDC). Instead of the circuitry and buttons being placed inside an oversized table-filling board, Scrimmage used a small plastic board and console. The players are in control of competing football teams. The simple circuitry inside the game board helps determine the results of each play: yards lost or gained, interceptions, fumbles, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EDC released a series of electronic board games under their &amp;quot;Computer Games&amp;quot; line, primarily consisting of two-player sports games. The series of games released in the late sixties used large wooden game boards depicting the playing field and a game matrix of various results. Each end of the game board had a set of buttons (i.e. offense and defense) that, depending on the combination pressed, would cause a light to illuminate next to one of the rows on the game matrix. The players would then consult the appropriate column to find out what happened. Scrimmage used a much smaller plastic gameboard which wasn't much larger than the size of the matrix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
