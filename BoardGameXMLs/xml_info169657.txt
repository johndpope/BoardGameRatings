							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hooked on Spelling Card Game</name>
									
			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Practice spelling skills by creating words with Beginning and Ending game cards. The first player to play all ten cards wins.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt ten cards each. Each card has either a beginning or ending of a word--generally 1-3 letters. The dealer turns over the top card of the draw deck. The first player must then make a word by adding either a beginning or end card, as appropriate. The next player may then either cover the beginning or ending of the played word with one of their own cards to make a new word. If a player is unable to play a card, he or she passes to the next player. If no player can make a new word, another card is drawn from the draw pile to replace the beginning or ending card and play resumes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to use all his or her card wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
