			<description>Squiggle Connect is a hilarious drawing game where players compete by changing a squiggly line into a picture. No artistic talent required . . . just your imagination!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It all starts with a roll of the dot cube and then the dots are connected by random lines using the connect cube. Once everyone has their unique squiggly line in front of them, play begins. Players have 60 seconds to transform their wavy and wacky line into a picture. They can be as simple or detailed as they want. When time is up, each player explains their drawing to the other players. This is where you may fall over laughing as you listen to some real nonsense! Once each player has had chance to explain what they drew, voting begins. Each player votes on only one other players drawing using a voting card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The voting cards offer either a descriptive praise or a nuance of criticism such as &amp;quot;put that in a doggie bag&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;a monkey can do better&amp;quot;. Each card also has a point value and players give them to each other based on their picture and description. It&amp;rsquo;s hysterical!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SQUIGGLE Connect recently won a National Parenting Publications Gold Award!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(from manufacturer's website)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
