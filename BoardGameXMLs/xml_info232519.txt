			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Passenger is an enigma. Is she contagious? Dangerous? Still sentient? Before the infection took a vicious hold, she was someone. A stowaway perhaps? Or a rescue from another mission? But then the fever started. Beads of sweat. Shortness of breath. The crew blamed it on anxiety. Even the medic missed the cues. But the fever incubated into something else. And it&amp;rsquo;s getting worse. It&amp;rsquo;s only a matter of time before the crew figures it out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Odinâ€™s Eye, the characters are search and rescue specialists aboard a galaxy-hopping spaceship. They&amp;rsquo;re dedicated, highly-trained, and often sent into impossibly hostile places. Their motto &amp;mdash; &amp;ldquo;No Star Unturned&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; serves as a reminder to never give up, even when the mission could spell their doom.&lt;br/&gt;While orbiting an alien planet, the crew of Odin&amp;rsquo;s Eye intercepts a distress beacon of unknown origin, squawking from the planet&amp;rsquo;s surface. Geological instability and fluctuating weather patterns make it difficult to pinpoint the beacon&amp;rsquo;s nexus. One thing is certain, its rhythmic signature is unlike any before.&lt;br/&gt;Something down there is either alien&amp;hellip; or confused.&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s only a matter of time before the planet&amp;rsquo;s toxicity kills whoever is sending the signal&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;Praxis is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters into dramatic situations and is based on the principles of the Protocol game system. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start-points, roles, plot twists, and finales. Praxis does not play like a traditional roleplaying game. It does not require a gamemaster. There is no script. No endpoint. No cumbersome or extraneous mechanics detracting from the story. An entire epic can be played in under four hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
