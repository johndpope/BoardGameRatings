			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eaten Away is a pickup roleplaying game (RPG) of zombie horror for one game master (GM) and one to five other players. A game of Eaten Away takes place over the course of one or more sessions, with the players taking on the role of survivors during or after the zombie apocalypse. Their goal is to survive and, if they're persistent and lucky, find a relatively safe place to begin building a better life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of the game is attrition, the steady erosion of one's capabilities and resources in the face of a threat - the zombies - that never rests, never relents, and lives only to eat. Players must work together, keep each other alive, and manage their individual and group resources well. The longer the group goes without hunkering down somewhere secure, the more dangerous things get - but no place is ever truly safe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eaten Away is designed to be played with zero preparation. Just sit down with some friends, decide who's going to be the GM, take a few minutes to create setting elements and survivors, and you're ready to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
