							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scandal</name>
									
			<description>Scandal is a card game designed by Edi Birsan and produced with images provided by Nina Hartley a well known adult actress of the decade.  The game was inspired by the Clinton-Lewinsky sex scandal and the design is a satire of that and all other scandals in history.  The cards are divided into categories, each representing elements of a good public scandal:  the Target, the Trigger, the Transgression, the Trumpeters (media), the Tidbits, and the Testimonials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns adding a card to the growing scandal.  Only one target, trigger, and transgression may be in play at any given time, and each is required for a complete scandal, but multiple cards from other categories may be added freely.  When the three required elements are present, a player may trigger a scoring round by playing one of two &amp;quot;It's History!&amp;quot; cards.  Scandals are thus generated until one player reaches a target total score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 54 cards are each marked with standard playing card rank and suit (to allow use for traditional card games), and many sport photos of nude or scantily clad women (the box carries a &amp;quot;not for sale to minors under 18&amp;quot; warning).  As part of the marketing, randomly 1 in 12 decks were given an extra card signed by Nina Hartley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
