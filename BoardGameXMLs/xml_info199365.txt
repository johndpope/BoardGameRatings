			<description>Conquer one Enemy card held by another player before someone conquers yours (2-4 players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1)Shuffle 9 Enemy cards and give two to each player (3 if a two player game). Each player places his enemy cards face up in front of him. Remove leftover Enemy cards from the game. Shuffle the rest of the cards and deal 5 to each player. The rest become the draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) A player begins his turn by discarding as many cards from his hand as he wishes and places them face down near the draw pile in a discard pile. He takes the same number of cards from the draw pile, always having 5 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) In time the player tries to collect any 5 that form a set listed on the Enemy cards. Divine Intervention is wild but can only be used once and never on Satan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) A soon as a player discards and draws, the next player takes his turn. If a player assembles a victory combination, he places those on the proper Enemy card (owned by an opponent) and declares &amp;quot;The battle is the Lord's&amp;quot; and is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
