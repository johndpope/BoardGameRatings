			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this storytelling game, the role of game master passes from player to player with frequency.  The game master, or &amp;quot;primary storyteller&amp;quot; narrates the overall story; the remaining players assume the characters of significance and narrate their own actions.  At any point, a character may interrupt the current story to tell one of their own in a &amp;quot;nested storytelling&amp;quot; event; once the story-in-a-story concludes the interrupted story resumes.  A set of customized character cards is used to spur creativity (ten sample cards are provided).  A timer may be used to limit the length of various stories, though this is optional.  Finally, a large number of tokens is used to control access to significant narrative input (to assure all players get a roughly equal time in the spotlight).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
