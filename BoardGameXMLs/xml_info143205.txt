							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shaintar:Legends Arise: Players Guide (Revised Edition)</name>
									
			<description>[Taken from the introductory text.]&lt;br/&gt;Shaintar is a complete fantasy-themed campaign setting designed for use with the Savage Worlds Deluxe Rules from Pinnacle Entertainment Group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is also a very complete source of fantasy gaming material for anyone who wants to enhance their SW fantasy experience. Here's some of what you will find just in the Player's Guide!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Enhanced rules for magic that help differentiate various styles while still maintaining pure focus on Savage Worlds' &amp;quot;Fast! Furious! Fun!&amp;quot; philsophy.&lt;br/&gt;     Various combat Edges and forms to ensure as many approaches to fantasy combat styles as there are to using magic. Unique martial arts, weapon-and-shield Edges, horseback Edges, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;     Tons of gear - weapons, traveling gear, kits, and an enhanced approach to armor that really nails the feel of different forms without sacrificing simplicity.&lt;br/&gt;     Dozens of new Edges, including Professional, Power, Combat, and Background. More importantly, each Race has a slew of Racial Edges that truly bring out the best qualities in each of the 11 Races provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Shaintar is not a place for killing kobolds for their copper pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Shaintar is for Heroes. More than that, it is for Legends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LEGENDS. NEVER. DIE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
