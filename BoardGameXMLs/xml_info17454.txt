			<description>This card game is a variant of Parker Brother's famous game of 'Pit', and is played in much the same manner. The instructions state: 'The game of Market or Covent Garden is so called solely because it is founded on the names of fruit or vegetables which are bought or sold, as in a market'. The game's contents are 72 market cards and 72 tally cards, instructions, 1 fresh card, 1 stale card and 1 market prices card. According to the box, the game is: &amp;quot;Humorous - Original - Exciting&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the latest and best card game for laughter and skill&amp;quot;. The game was made by the Kum-Bak Mfg Co Ltd of Leicester Square in London.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
