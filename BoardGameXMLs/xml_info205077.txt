							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">New Bedford: White Whale Promo</name>
									
			<description>The White Whale promo pack includes four new tiles that may be placed in the whaling bag. Each tile has a different effect when drawn and selected:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;White Whale - This whale is wily and dangerous; it has a big payout, but it will cost you a ship. &lt;br/&gt;Ambergris - A rare, waxlike substance produced by whales and used in perfuming, which provides $8 immediately. &lt;br/&gt;Castaway - A lone survivor found on an island; he provides an extra action. &lt;br/&gt;Blue Whale - A whale so big that it fills the entire boat, and the art barely fits on the tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: This promo (provided to Kickstarter backers) was packaged separately and is not included with the Rising Tide expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
