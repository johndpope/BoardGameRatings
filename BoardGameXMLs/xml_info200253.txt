			<description>From the DriveThruRPG product page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awaiting the End is a GM-less one-sheet game about a group of people in a terrible Place awaiting an impending Doom. They might be prisoners awaiting their execution in prison, space travelers waiting for their oxygen to give out in a tiny escape pod, or PhD candidates waiting in a dorm cafeteria to hear why their dissertation was rejected. To pass the time they tell each other stories about how they got there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awaiting the End fits on a single trifold pamphlet and requires minimal preparation. In about an hour, three to six players will generate a world, a situation, and their characters; tell each other how they ended up in their pitiable condition; and then find out who escaped the Doom and who succumbed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by Fiasco, Canterbury Tales, Rashomon, The Usual Suspects, Slumdog Millionaire, Spider and Web, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
