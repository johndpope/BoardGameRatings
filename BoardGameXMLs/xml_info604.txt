			<description>We are in the the omnipotent Sultan's magnificent throne-room. Dignified he sits on his throne surrounded by his twelve loyal and devoted Vizirs. Loyal and devoted? No way! Each and every one strives only for the opportunity to dethrone the Sultan and grasp the power for himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To reach this goal each player must send his vizirs to the remote cities at the outskirts of the Realm, in order to acquire troops, weapon and bribes (in form of Power cards). Being absent unfortunately reduces the vizir's influence and importance at court and makes him an easy target for intrigues, and suspicions of betrayal can quickly lead to the dungeons - or to the Island of Banishing disappearing forever. Therefore a Vizir should not leave court for longer periods of time, and on his return should he always seek out the best place - such as one carrying a large number of votes (the seat-number).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only the player who is capable of balancing the various facets of the game - and most intelligently maneuvers his vizirs - will have a chance to win the struggle for subversion in the palace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
