			<description>Scenario pack for Advanced Squad Leader. Tactical combat at the company level set during the Second World War, specifically the battles at Carpiquet airfield during Operation WINDSOR in July 1944.

Fourteen entries by 12 authors were judged by well-known players and scenario designers in the ASL community at the gamesquad.com online community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenarios include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MWT1: Field of Fire        &lt;br/&gt;MWT2: Fourth of July    &lt;br/&gt;MWT3: Fifty Butchers    &lt;br/&gt;MWT4: Stalwart Sons    &lt;br/&gt;MWT5: Carpiquet Ballet     &lt;br/&gt;MWT6: Rifles Standing Where They Fell&lt;br/&gt;MWT7: The Streets of Carpiquet    &lt;br/&gt;MWT8: The Hangers at Carpiquet    &lt;br/&gt;MWT9: Le Lande Leads    &lt;br/&gt;MWT10: Party Boys        &lt;br/&gt;MWT11: A Choice Morsel&lt;br/&gt;MWT11.b: A Choice Morsel&lt;br/&gt;MWT12.1: Tenacious Defense        &lt;br/&gt;MWT13: Prelude to Caen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
