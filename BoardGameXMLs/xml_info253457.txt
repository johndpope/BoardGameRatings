			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, further into the Depths of Purple Mountain- the Bastion of Entropy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a titanic battle, the New Gods sealed a rift in the mysterious Purple Mountain that emitted pure Chaos- and set a Bastion to study and watch over it. The powers of Law and Chaos alternated control of the Bastion of Entropy, and all was well- until the yakshas came and stole the paramours of a Demon Queen and an Empyreal Lord! Now it is up to an intrepid party of adventurers to breach the Bastion, find the demonic and angelic lovers, and return them to their rightful place, securing just reward- and avoiding the petulant wrath of demigods&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a long hiatus, the next level of the Purple Mountain Megadungeon is here! Written by Perry Fehr, Purple Mountain VIII: The Bastion of Entropy proceeds deeper into the 8th level of the enigmatic, many-leveled mountain labyrinth, and includes everything you need to play in the Porphyra Roleplaying Game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Detailed GM and players&amp;rsquo; maps of the Bastion and the Cyst of Life&lt;br/&gt;    Full backstory of the Bastion and its current inhabitants- the decadent yakshas!&lt;br/&gt;    Incredible artwork&lt;br/&gt;    Statblocks of all monsters and NPCs used in the module, including several Monsters of Porphyra! A new outsider subtype, the materialistic, sensual yakshas are showcased.&lt;br/&gt;    A summary of items magic and mundane, is included!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
