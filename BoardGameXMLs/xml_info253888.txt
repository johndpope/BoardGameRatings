							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Role Descriptions - The Needs of Others</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the morning of 6 April 1994, you wake up to the same interviews on all the morning TV news shows. Arkansas is national champion. How many times can they ask Corliss Williamson how it feels? How often can they ask him if beating Duke made the title special?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In between sports news you hear short snippets of other stories. The Serbs still lobbing shells at Gorazde. Liberia still plunging into chaos. At the very end, a sentence or two noting that the plane of President Habyarimana (who&amp;rsquo;s that?) from Rwanda (Africa? Asia?) was shot down last night. All on board were killed. You let most of this run in one ear and out the other. While you&amp;rsquo;d like to have the time to pay attention to the rest of the world, in fact most of your life is consumed with making sure your daughter gets to her basketball game and your son remembers to practice the piano.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are, in other words, an ordinary American.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presents basic game orientation and extensive character role information and sheets - most intended as print-and-play handouts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
