							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Das Schleswig-Holstein-Spiel</name>
									
			<description>A simple trivia game played on a map of the German State of Schleswig-Holstein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A long track winds around the State, starting in Hamburg and ending on the Isle of Sylt. Movement is decided by a die. There are four categories of questions:&lt;br/&gt;A = General knowledge&lt;br/&gt;K = Culture&lt;br/&gt;W = Economic&lt;br/&gt;P = Politics and History&lt;br/&gt;Obviously, all the 500 questions in the game have some connection to Schleswig Holstein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an interesting shortcut that may be taken where no questions are asked. Instead you roll the die and if you get a number from 1 to 5, you move two spaces. But if you roll a 6, you must go back 15 spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First to reach the end (Ziel) wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a little bit of extra trivia, the board shows clearly that the Eastern neighbour to Schleswig-Holstein is, in fact, the DDR (East Germany). As the game was published in 1989 and the wall came down that year, then this might be the last non-historical game to feature the DDR as a neighbouring country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
