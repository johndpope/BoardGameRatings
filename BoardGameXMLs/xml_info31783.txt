			<description>&lt;br/&gt;    What is the Tosenkyo?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To-sen-kyo means throwing-fan-amusement. To contest your skill with your rival, aim the target, toss the fan, and then refer scoring chart for victory points (VP). Although its elegant image made some fantasy like &amp;quot;game of Heian Era from a millennium ago&amp;quot;, it is only legend. According to evidences of manuscripts, it might be flourished from middle of Edo era (about 1770s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skilled veteran makes victory points constantly. Beginner may hit big score luckily. Because of this easily enjoyability for everyone, it won popularity once among commoners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Difference of Tosenkyo from Darts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As same throwing game, Tosenkyo is frequently compared with Darts. The most significant deference of Tosenkyo from Darts is way of scoring. VP of Darts are gained from stabbed area directly. But in Tosenkyo, after hitting fan dropped the target down from the Base box, VP would be determined between distance and over/under positions of fan and target (and sometimes Base of target). Beginner cannot win almost against veteran in Darts. But in Tosenkyo, scoring system has some happening factors. Some beginner may hit big lucky score and win against constant veteran. This makes the game unexpectedly thrilling and exciting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In fact, adequate proportion of luck factor against cool rule is the joyous essence of Tosenkyo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.tosenkyo.net/whats-e.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.tosenkyo.net/whats-e.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
