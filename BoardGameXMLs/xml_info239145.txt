			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I started out with the ambition of changing the 4th Edition adventure series H1: Keep on the Shadowfell, H2: Thunderspire Labyrinths, and H3: Pyramid of Shadows &amp;ndash; as there was very little in the plotline that really tied these adventures together into a full story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having just finished up the conversion of H3 one year have gone past and I have come to realize with the later releases of P2 to E3 that the strong Orcus plotline that I was looking for is actually being deliver by Wizard of the Coast. We are now facing a mega adventure path from level 1 to 30 circling around Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath &amp;ndash; and I am loving it. Thank you very much WoC, this is going to be a great saga to be told by my players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However there are still some small adjustments that can be made in order to tie the adventures together more, at least in P1 to P3. I therefore decided to continue trying to enhance these great adventures to the best of my ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note that you should read through the H1 and H3 Conversion Guides first, as it gives you the full background story to the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
