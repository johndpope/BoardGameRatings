			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Human Point of View: Listen well, child. Listen to the story. For there is a lesson at the end of it. And if we are wise, we will learn something before the tale is done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You see, a long time ago, this land - your homeland called &amp;quot;Shanri&amp;quot; - was not ruled by sagacious men as it is today. No, once upon a time, the land was ruled by terrible creatures with powers so vast, not even mortal ... blah blah blah&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Dragon Point of View: Bah! Puny mortals! What do they know?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragons are big! Dragons are powerful! Dragons rule the world! That's all little mortals need to know. All they're good for is stomping!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stomp! Stomp! Stomp!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Oh, and we eat your socks!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the Game: This is a little game for little dragons. It's cute, it's funny, and it's the perfect RPG for younger players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The simple rules encourage player interaction and reward creativity. If you're looking for a younger player's first role playing game, give DRAGON a try.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
