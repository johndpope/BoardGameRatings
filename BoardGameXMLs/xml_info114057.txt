			<description>The Far Wilds is a dynamic turn-based game. You create an army (a deck of cards) to battle your opponents, destroy their armies, control flux wells, gain glory, and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has an army (deck of cards) that they bring into battle. Your army is composed of various cards that you pick out before the battle begins. You Build your deck in the Army Building Screen. Once you start a battle players take turns moving units and playing cards until both players pass. Then the new round begins and you can move your units and play cards again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first player to reach 20 Glory. There are many cards that allow you to gain Glory in various ways. The most common way to gain glory is to control more Flux Wells than your opponents. The person that controls the most Flux Wells at the end of any round gains 2 Glory. &lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://thefarwilds.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://thefarwilds.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
