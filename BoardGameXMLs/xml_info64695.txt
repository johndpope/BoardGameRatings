							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">El Fantastico Contra Dracula</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Misadventure #2 you'll make a run to the border-- straight back home! Victims of circumstance are once again caught up in the efforts of a well meaning chump to save innocent bystanders and they must hope that he is some help to THEM! America has its own special heroes, but for the poor and the downtrodden of Mexico, justice appears in the doughy form of a mysterious masked man. No one knows from whence he comes, but his supreme grappling prowess has made him a hero of truly legendary proportions. He is El Fantastico, the Golden-Masked Man, the Heavyweight Wrestling Champion of All Mexico!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While others may use their gifts in pursuit of personal gain, in between his title defences El Fantastico uses his own awesome abilities to aid those in need-particularly those with wrestling-related problems. In any event, whenever a desperate, poorly-dubbed plea for help goes out, the Golden-Masked Man is always there to put evil down for the count of three.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recognition of all his altruism and wrestling, El Fantastico has amassed a legion of devoted fans, and among them are a select coterie who have selflessly volunteered to aid the Golden-Masked Man whenever a dire need arises. During such times of peril, Los Amigos de El Fantastico stand side-by-side with their masked idol to form a champion tag team for justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These remarkable men and women find their courage and wrestling tested as never before, when without warning, a dark and unholy spectre manifests itself in the heart of Mexico. The fiend of fiends, Count Dracula, sets his ghoulish sights south of the border in a malevolent attempt to extend his diabolical dominion. Can even the mighty El Fantastico and his stalwart Amigos prevail against the Lord of the Undead himself?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
