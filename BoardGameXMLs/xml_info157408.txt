							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">VTT Tokens Volume 01: Virtual Tabletop Tokens Fantasy</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hmm I swear I&amp;rsquo;ve seen these faces before, but something is different...And new faces have emerged from the crowd as well.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a Fantasy VTT token pack of 150+ 300 dpi .png top downs. Many of these top downs originally appeared in Top Down Armies Dwarfs V Goblins, Humans V Orcs, and Elves V Undead with a green hex base. DramaScape friends have asked for them with a transparent base to more seamlessly integrate into their onscreen VTT maps. DramaScape listens to our fans and have done so in this pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     In addition to these remastered top downs, there are a lot of new top downs in this pack.&lt;br/&gt;     A gnome and halffolk were added for small heroes in an adventuring party.&lt;br/&gt;     DramaScape friends requested more female top downs; so four human females were added, including a redhead knight with a one-handed axe and a second brunette barbarian with a two-handed axe by fan request, and two longbow women. Other new human additions also include two new male wizards and two new male berserkers,&lt;br/&gt;     Two new troll topdowns were added with a one with a rocky and one with a dirty appearance.&lt;br/&gt;     Four new undead topdowns include two zombies, a vampire, and a winged skeleton.&lt;br/&gt;     An entirely new category of 27 monster top downs were also made, many based on models used for the figure flats in Fantasy Creatures. This category includes beetles, boars, Cyclops, devils, dinosaurs, elementals, floating eyes, giants, hyenas, slugs, spiders, toad men, and treants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The VTT is organized via category Dwarfs, Elves, Gnome, Halffolk, Humans, Monsters, Orcs, Ratmen, Trolls and Undead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
