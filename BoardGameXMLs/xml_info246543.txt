			<description>The World's Greatest Zoo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The director of Zooronga is retiring and you&amp;rsquo;re one of the few zookeepers who could be chosen to assume this most coveted position! Do you have what it takes to run the greatest zoo the world has ever seen? Compete with the other zookeepers to find the most exotic animals, design the best enclosures, and create the most beautiful gardens and pathways for your lucky patrons to enjoy. Prove that you are capable of attracting the most visitors to your zoo and you might just become the new director of Zooronga - the World&amp;rsquo;s Greatest Zoo!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zooronga is a zoo-building, tile-laying game. Each player is a zookeeper with some money and a place to start. The game lasts for five months and each month 5 zoo-tiles are auctioned for the highest bidder. At the end of the month points are calculated. Each zoo-tile contains two animal enclosures of animals from different regions (eg. polar animals, African animals etc), some roads and possibly trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player secretly selects the amount of money he is willing to pay for the tile and the highest bidder wins the auction. Whenever a tile is bought it needs to be added to your zoo so that the roads and green areas match. It might be that after the tile is added to your zoo, your zoo becomes more interesting than before. Interest value is shown with little stars on the tiles. The more stars of one color you have, the more interesting your zoo is for that region. Visitors are also interested in trees and parks. Visitors always go for the most interesting zoos and at the end of the month each visitor in your zoo gives you points. When the month ends, each player receives some income and new zoo-tiles are drawn for auction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to attract as many visitors to your zoo as possible and thus score more points than others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
