							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Archetypes of Nyarlathotep</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Evil With Many Faces!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The eldritch, the strange, and the weird are often relegated to the domains of villains and NPCs in fantasy, with the good guys being the ones who stand in the way of the dark things that remain just beyond our perception, which we can never truly understand. But sometimes, it can be fun to take on the mantle of the otherworldly, and to embrace the alien terrors of the cosmos. Each installment of Weekly Wonders: Eldritch Archetypes contains five archetypes for eldritch characters&amp;mdash;those that are weird, alien, and otherworldly, who don&amp;rsquo;t fit in with normal society&amp;mdash;as well as a cleric domain devoted to a specific mythos entity or race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular installment focuses on the various avatars and incarnations of the mysterious entity known as Nyarlathotep. Described in numerous different, and sometimes contradictory, fashions by a variety of authors, the only constant that seems to apply to Nyarlathotep is its malevolent interest in mortal affairs.  Each of the archetypes in this book is patterned off of one of Nyarlathotep&amp;rsquo;s many avatars, aspects, or forms. This book contains the following archetypes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The dark pharaoh, an mesmerist archetype that can deliver pharaonic curses to his foes, an excels at controlling large crowds.&lt;br/&gt;    The lurker in darkness, a rogue archetype who gains a variety of supernatural powers from darkness, including increased combat capabilities and a defensive shroud of shadows.&lt;br/&gt;    The skintaker, a slayer archetype that can wear the skins of its foes to create supernatural disguises, animate severed skins into servitor minions, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;    The disciple of the black book, a witch archetype focused on deceiving her foes through disguising her spells and manipulating enemies into doing her bidding unknowingly.&lt;br/&gt;    The master of many faces, a wizard archetype specializing in polymorph spells, allowing them to adopt as many personas as Nyarlathotep itself.&lt;br/&gt;    A bonus cleric domain devoted to those who worship Nyarlathotep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
