							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dancouga: Wild Battle Simulation Game</name>
									
			<description>A free game that came with a Japanese anime magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses the anime show Dancouga as the background setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a simple 1 to 4 player Solitaire/co-op game.  Players pick one of the four main character of the anime show, each of which has different set of traits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All characters have a Movement Allowance and Combat Strength.  Combat Strength increases during the game with accumulated &amp;quot;power&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map have 37 hexes divided into 6 areas.  Most hexes are marked with an enemy strength and event name.  At the start of each turn, a player rolls two dice: one indicates which area and the other indicates in which hex of the area the event happens.  The player moves his character counter on the map to encounter the enemy marked there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comparing the combat strength of the character and the enemy, the higher side wins.  The character will get the stated number of &amp;quot;power&amp;quot; if he wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players win the game once there are no more active events on the map.  The players lose if 40 turns pass without them meeting that victory condition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Component:&lt;br/&gt;A rule book (also a characters and mechanical design art book of the anime show)&lt;br/&gt;Counter sheet (at the back cover of the rule book, the counters must be cut out before play)&lt;br/&gt;A map (the other side of the map is a poster of the other anime show, Zeta Gundam, not related to the game)&lt;br/&gt;Six-side dice are required but not included in the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
