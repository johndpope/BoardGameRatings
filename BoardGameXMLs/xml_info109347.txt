							<name  sortindex="5">The Genius Guide to Loot 4 Less: Volume 2â€”Pretty, Pretty, Rings</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pretty, Pretty, Rings</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here in Loot 4 Less II: Pretty, Pretty, Rings we're looking at just the cheapest of rings, easy items any character can use. Not only do we provide each item with a full description and cost, we've scattered sidebars throughout the book to explain those costs. Each Behind the Counter sidebar explains how a price was arrived at, allowing GMs to apply the logic to other abilities (and be better able to change the pricing to match the needs of their campaign, with a firm knowledge of where the numbers come from).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the second book in the Loot 4 Less line, where we deal exclusively in items with a cost-to-consumer of 2,500 gp or less. That's right: no epic items, twelve-spell staves or even moderate magic items here. This is a forum for the cheapest of the cheap, and that's it. And just to up the level of difficulty, we also don't deal in one-shot (or even two- or three-shot) magic items. No scrolls, potions, talismans or fire-and-forget tattoo magics here. Everything in these pages is a legitimate permanent magic item, free of charges and able to be used in adventure after adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what are you waiting for? Get your Brightmote Ring or Ring of Stoutness today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
