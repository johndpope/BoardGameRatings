			<description>The Football Wooden Travel Game is a dice game that uses pegs on a solid wood board. The players roll 2 dice simultaneously and consult the board to see the outcome of the play. As in normal American Football, each player gets 3 downs before they have the option to go for it on 4th down or punt. The first to 28 points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
