							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crime Solver Party: The Black Hole Mystery</name>
									
			<description>The Crime Solver series games play like standard parlor murder/mystery parties.  Each game is playable by 4, 6, or 8 people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who murdered Lt. Gail Johns?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space station geologist Lt. Gail Johns jettisoned from the station on a data gathering jet pack ride in orbit.  Someone sabatoged her pack!  The crew members all look pale.  It had to be one of them that sent the lieutenant on a space ride into the sun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The suspects:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Captain Kirk Hagen: Space station captain and war hero flying ace.&lt;br/&gt;    Dr. Rick Moriarity: The station's doctor and number one womanizer.&lt;br/&gt;    Natasha Turensky: Czech ballerina and dance film star.&lt;br/&gt;    Lt. Dorothy Borman: Navigator for the station, she guided the ship safely around Earth.&lt;br/&gt;    Buck Barraza: Spicy South American ace pilot with a yearning for his co-pilot.&lt;br/&gt;    Lt. Yvonne Escobar: Sexy co-pilot responsible for keeping buck's attention from the skies.&lt;br/&gt;    Sabrina Ashley: American film star and TV soap commercial queen.  A guest abort the station because of Presidential pull and a good complexion.&lt;br/&gt;    Faheem Abdul Kamal:  Arab oilman and multi-billionaire.  Aboard the station as a gesture of peace and hopefully cheaper oil imports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
