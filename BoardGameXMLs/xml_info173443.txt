							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tao of Peg</name>
									
			<description>What do Backgammon, Go, and Chess all have in common? They are board games that have stood the test of time. Built on simplicity but with potential for complexity these games provide a challenge for players at all levels. Tao of Peg is designed to use a combination of luck and strategy to win in a variety of ways. Tao of Peg is the perfect game for family fun or for more serious gaming nights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board and pegs are made of wood, and the board design is printed on a vinyl sheet and applied directly to a wooden base. The entire board is lightly coated with a protective varnish. Felt buttons are then added to the bottom corners to protect playing surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt four cards. A player begins by discarding a card from their hand. The player then places a game piece in any space with the corresponding color on the board. The turns ends by the player drawing a new card from the pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the 100 colored playing cards (25 per colored quadrant), each set also has two types of wild cards. Players may play a wild card instead of a colored card. Red wild cards allow the player to remove any game piece in play and black wild cards allow the player to place a game piece anywhere on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four different ways to win;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    make a row of 5 pegs anywhere on the board&lt;br/&gt;    make a row of 4 pegs in a single quadrant&lt;br/&gt;    place a peg in each corner of a single quadrant&lt;br/&gt;    place a peg in each corner of the game board&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
