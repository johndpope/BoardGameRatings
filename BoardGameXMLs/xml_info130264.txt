							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hunt the Ghost</name>
									
			<description>An early Victorian board game, probably inspired by games such as Fox &amp;amp; Geese where it pits one player against the rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player is the Ghost and the rest of the players are hunters. The Ghost is placed in the central diamond on the board and the playing pieces of the other players in the five diamonds nearest the Ferry (but not across the water). The movements are diamond to diamond through the lines joining them and you can cross from one circular line to another when there is a line linking them. The cards can not cross water anywhere but the Ghost may do so by following the dotted lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghost wins the game if he succeeds in crossing the water to the part of the country at the top of the board. The Hunters win if they surround the Ghost and force him on to the diamond at either of the two houses with diamonds, or on to the either of the two diamonds at the Cave, or on to the centre diamond so that he cannot escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ghost moves first and then the Hunters, then the Ghost again, and so on. Neither the Ghost or Hunters can be taken. Everyone can move backwards or forwards, but only one move each turn. (I assume that you can only move into empty diamonds and not occupied ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
