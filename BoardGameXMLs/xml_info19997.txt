			<description>It's summer on the North Pole, and Lars and his friends are anjoying the sun. It gets rather crowded on the icebergs. Quite fast, some of the icebear friends glide down to the the water. But, with some skill you can help the friends get the best spot in the sun. This requires a steady hand, to place your cards firmly on the ice berg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a deck of cards, some counters and two icebergs (three dimensional cardboard stands). At the beginning of each game, each player receives a number of cards, of which three are face up. Each turn a player tries to get rid of one of his face up cards. This is done by placing the cards on one of the icebergs. How exactly the card is to be placed is determined by the animal depicted on the card. Some cards need to be placed against a side of the iceberg, others need to be on top, etc. In some cases, it is not the card that needs to be placed, but a cardboard counter (using the card as a tool).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player succeeds in placing his card, he draws a new card from his pile and puts it next to his other face up cards. However, if one or more cards fall down while he tries to place his cards, half of the cards that have fallen down are shuffled and put on his draw pile (the others are discarded).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get rid of all his cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
