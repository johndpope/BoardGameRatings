			<description>(#@*^, it's fun!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The official game of OverMen everywhere; &amp;quot;Bob&amp;quot;ball! offers the perfect combination of awesome and balls in a revolutionary, mind-altering format. This instant classic is a re-imagining of the longer-to-brew hit game you've heard only whispers about from another tier of consciousness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Bob&amp;quot;ball! is a game for two players. Try to save your mutant family and get them to the Pleasure Saucers before X-Day. Beware, there's only enough room for one more family. The other will be condemned to fry on Earth with the rest of the Normals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So pull the wool over your own eyes, grab some dice, and praise &amp;quot;Bob&amp;quot; or kill him. You've never seen balls like these.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use your &amp;quot;Bob&amp;quot;balls to bounce around along the grid to pick up family members and deliver them to the Pleasure Saucers. Each turn, roll three dice, assign the values to each &amp;quot;Bob&amp;quot;ball, and move. Make them hit your opponent's ball and transfer movement power to form chain reactions to keep them from scoring. Hitting another &amp;quot;Bob&amp;quot;ball stops yours and can transfer a family from one to another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
