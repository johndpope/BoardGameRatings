							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gaddafi&#039;s Angels</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hello Angels!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although their leader is dead, the all-female fighting force known as Gaddafi's Angels carries on the fight against the sinister Agents of HUMMUS, with a new voice giving them direction over the red phone that was their one-time connection to Colonel Muammar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ROLF!: Gaddafi's Angels is another fact-based supplement for ROLF!: The Rollplaying Game of Big Dumb Fighters (well... fact-based in the sense that the recently overthrown and murdered Libyian dictator did comport himself like a real-world Blofeld or Dr. Doom and did surround himself with armed hotties as bodyguards; and that Sarah Palin is a woman of mystery). It features three combat scenarios and five pre-generated characters, including game stats for Gaddafi's Angels, the Agents of HUMMUS, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, and Sarah Palin. Also included are a selection of Combat Maneuvers featured in previous ROLF! supplements, but repeated here for ease of reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
