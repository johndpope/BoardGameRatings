			<description>The goal of &amp;quot;Oldies Game&amp;quot; is for each player to move his or her tokens to the finish line as quickly as possible. The first player to do so, wins. The winner, thereby, proves that he or she is not &amp;quot;old&amp;quot;, but is still &amp;quot;young&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By rolling dice, players move around the game board into different colour-coded areas. Each area provides various obstacles to overcome (as explained on the game board) and assignments to complete (as explained on cards drawn in play). These obstacles and assignments can involve both physical stamina and brain power. In some cases, players &amp;quot;duel&amp;quot; directly with their opponents in order to progress on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
