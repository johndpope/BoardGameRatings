			<description>Out of the Park Baseball 18 &amp;ndash; the sequel to Metacritics PC Game of the Year 2016 and officially licensed by MLB.com and the MLBPA - is the best baseball strategy game ever.&lt;br/&gt;Step into the shoes of a team owner, GM, and/or field manager to own the future or rewrite the past of your favorite real-world baseball team. Start a new career with 2017 MLB Opening Day rosters of the real major or minor leagues, play with 9 international leagues, or span through 150 years of history and run any club from the past. You can even create your own fictional baseball world! Perform drafts, trades, scouting, waivers, team finances and personnel. Negotiate player contracts. Dive into the more hands-on management and set your team's lineups, pitching staffs, and in-game strategy. You can oversee your league at a high level, or play out each game, managing play by play or even pitch by pitch!&lt;br/&gt;Boston Red Sox Principal Owner John W. Henry said it himself - &amp;quot;OOTP is an astonishing accomplishment!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;For this new season, the game is jammed with dozens of new and improved features, for example 3D highlight reels, new challenge mode, redesigned injury system, vastly improved AI &amp;amp; game engine, historical Negro leagues and much more! Out of the Park Baseball 18 is an astounding journey through the past, present, and future of baseball.&lt;br/&gt;Major League Baseball trademarks and copyrights are used with permission of MLB Advanced Media, L.P.
