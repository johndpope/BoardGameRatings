			<description>The game &amp;quot;Das Kapital&amp;quot; was included in Spielbox 4/82 as part of the &amp;quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen/Game to Remove&amp;quot; series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is played on a triangular board with 81 hex spaces. It is a variation of a chess game for 3 players. And as in chess, the object of the game is the capture of the opposing king(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 9 playing pieces:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 1 Kapital (similar to the king in chess)&lt;br/&gt;- 1 Intelligenz (similar to the knight)&lt;br/&gt;- 1 Kirche (similar to the rook)&lt;br/&gt;- 1 Milit&amp;auml;r (similar to the bishop)&lt;br/&gt;- 1 Politiker (similar to the queen)&lt;br/&gt;- 4 Arbeiter (similar to the pawn)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The total number of playing pieces is exactly 1/3 (27) of the board size of 81. And since 54 spaces are empty at the beginning, a slower development of the game is achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several additions are made to the normal rules, like enabling the capture of own pieces (which allows an additional move) or making a putsch against the own pieces. It's not explicitly mentioned, but I guess, these additions can be left away to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
