							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Jumonville Incident</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the early 18th century, Britain and France had clearly become the dominant imperial powers in North America. New France extended in a great arc that stretched from New Orleans, at the mouth of the Mississippi River, north to the Great Lakes, and east, down the St. Lawrence, through Canada. This chain of forts, trading posts, and settlements threatened to hem in the more populous colonies of New England, which clustered along the Atlantic coast. Driven by ambitions to expand their overseas empires and improve their positions in Europe, the two imperial powers were often at war. These struggles drew in colonists, indigenous populations, and other European powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is intended for single session, collegiate-level play in the classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
