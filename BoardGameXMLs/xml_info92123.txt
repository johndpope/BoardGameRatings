							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BattleTech: Wolf&#039;s Dragoons</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Who Are Those Guys?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No mercenary regiment is more well known, nor as universally respected. Indeed, other units of the Inner Sphere validate their prowess by surviving an encounter with the Dragoons. Among their ranks is Natasha Kerensky, known as the Black Widow, and perhaps the most romanticized MechWarrior in history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The strategic and tactical knowledge of Jaime Wolf, the heart and soul of the Dragoons, is beyond reproach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unit's supplies and equipment are of the finest quality. Their 'Mechs never want for repair parts. Their ranks are closed and private.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since appearing in the Inner Sphere in 3005, the Dragoons have been employed in turn by every house of the Successor States. No amount of money, political power, or threats have coerced them to renew a contract. Speculation and conjecture over their motives and origin are commonplace and wildly varied. Governmental intelligence and security networks have expended countless man-hours and C-bills trying to learn their secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now war consumes the Inner Sphere, and the Dragoons' contract with House Kurita has expired. Where they throw their support could determine the outcome of the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ComStar document is the most accurate, up-to-date assemblage of information ever compiled about the Dragoons. Their history, organization, and unique membership are exposed in great detail. Find out the who, what, where, when and why(s) of the most powerful regiment in the Inner Sphere today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The true identity of Wolf's Dragoons is perhaps the biggest open secret in modern BattleTech, but at the time of writing this sourcebook was a detailed look at one of the biggest mysteries of the BattleTech game. One of the largest sourcebooks produced by FASA at the time of release, this book is packed with background detail on the history of the Dragoons in the Inner Sphere, their tactics and training, and details on a range of their equipment. This included a number of 'Mech designs which were unique to the Dragoon's at this point, such as the Imp and the Annihilator,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sourcebook hasn't been reprinted to date, and the current licence holder for BattleTech hasn't announced any intention to do a reprint as at Jan 2011, making this something of a collector's item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
