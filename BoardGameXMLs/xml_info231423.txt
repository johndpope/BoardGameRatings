			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clachan is an abstract strategy game inspired by Draughts, Connect 4, and Go. Clachan is named after the Scottish Gaelic word for &amp;quot;stones&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clachan is played on a board that can be used as a 5x5, 7x7 or 9x9 board. The goal of Clachan is to create a line of stones from one side of the board to the other while your opponent works against you by blocking your progress or capturing your stones. The game is over when a player either creates a line which results in a win, or the board is filled with no lines created resulting in a draw. During the game players may place new stone, move existing stones, and capture opponent stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
