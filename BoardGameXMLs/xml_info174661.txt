			<description>In the future, sooner than you&amp;rsquo;d bet on&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the world progressed towards the future, the wealthy elite one-percenters found themselves losing their passions.  Golf&amp;rsquo;s formerly exclusive clubs were opened to the masses, horse racing was banned as cruel, and auto racing was found to be not &amp;quot;carbon credit cost effective&amp;quot;.  The elite needed a new pastime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately for them, a new class of mass-spectacle gladiators was found. Questionable lab projects involving human-cloning, attempting to solve the world&amp;rsquo;s worst diseases, created a global zombie pandemic.  Luckily, the crisis was put down quickly &amp;ndash; but the lab-created undead still existed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Someone with a bit of redneck, and way too much time, picked up a few up zombie &amp;ldquo;assets&amp;rdquo; at a company bankruptcy liquidation. After a little tinkering, he managed to build a control collar contraption. When a zombie was outfitted with a collar, a skillful operator could, sort-of, get the zombies to walk in a straight line.  Conveniently, the undead had no legal rights, which made them the perfect attraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A viral video and a crowd-sourced funding campaign later, these not-so-intelligent shamblers were being billed as the latest thing in racing spectacles.  Wealthy backers quickly formed teams, a league and championship cup was created, and the wealthy few who could afford the labs, zombie jockeys, and all that related to it now had a new prestigious exclusive club.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with all good clubs, betting became part of the social fun.  As one could never really count on one&amp;rsquo;s zombie to come through, betting for, or even against one&amp;rsquo;s own entry into the race was not only allowed, it was encouraged!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While these new zombie drivers competed against each other for the series championship, the owners had their own prestige cup based on bets, side bets, crowd ratings and worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bet on your friends zombie driver to make the podium &amp;hellip; SURE!   Bet on your zombie to place third &amp;hellip; WHY NOT? WIN when your zombie shambles over the line backwards &amp;hellip; CHECK!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the wacky, zany, risky but always crazy world of high stakes championship zombie racing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Twenty Yard Shamble, players are owners of racing zombies. They pit their zombie against the other zombies, in a series of 3 races, out of an arena where armed Hunters and helpless Victims prowl. Zombies move in a semi-controlled fashion based on dice rolls. The arena has 6 finish lines spaced equally around the outside edge. The first zombie to cross a finish line is first, and earns points for it's owner AND anyone who bet on it. The second zombie to cross gets second, and the third zombie gets third. After the third zombie crossed a line, the crowd gets bored, and all remaining zombies are shot and killed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a race, players place bets on any of the racing zombies, including their own. If a players zombie is not performing well, that player can place a bet on another player's zombie who is performing better, and may be able to help that zombie finish better in the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of 3 races, the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
