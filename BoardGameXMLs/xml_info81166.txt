							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Caves of Chaos</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Caves of Chaos serve as a lair for all manner of fell creatures. These caves can be the home to a dangerous cult, shelter a horde of marauding orcs or the hiding spot for fabulous treasures. The map shows three entrances to a network of caverns and chambers. The map is rich in details including fire pits, a primitive throne and monstrous statue. Branching openings allow this map to serve as the beginning of a greater system of tunnels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gale Force Nine&amp;rsquo;s Official DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS Game Mats are high-quality single-sided vinyl surfaces that are ideal battle grids for staging encounters during your adventures! The mats lie flat for ease of play and are sold in a sturdy polycarbonate tube for easy storage and transport. The mats may be marked with WET-ERASE markers to temporarily alter terrain areas or make other notes about battlefield conditions during play. The Game Mats measure 20&amp;rdquo; x 30&amp;rdquo; and are marked with a 1&amp;rdquo; grid. All of GF9's Game Mats are based on artwork provided by Wizards of the Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
