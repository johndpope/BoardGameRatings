							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sandwiches</name>
									
			<description>Sandwiches is a card game for 2 to 4 players.  Players compete to put the most Sandwiches in play, and the first player to have 7 Sandwiches in play or if there are no cards left to draw, then the player with the most Sandwiches wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do you get Sandwiches?  You set your opponent up.  Every card has two abilities on it, when you play the card, you do both abilities in order.  Every card also has a Sandwich on it, when your opponent does the action listed for the Sandwich, then you get to score that card as a Sandwich.  The abilities on the card are about either drawing cards, or stealing cards, or replacing cards, or controlling what your opponent draws or has in their hand.  In short, you are manipulating your opponent's situation so that they play what you want them to play, so you can score points or 'Sandwich' off of their play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
