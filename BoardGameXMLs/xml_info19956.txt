							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slots&#039;n Dots</name>
									
			<description>Slots'n Dots is contains 48 plastic chips (six each of the numbers 1 through 7, portrayed with different numbers of dots, plus three each of single-ring and double-ring chips).  It is played on a special plastic board which contains seven recessed areas that allow a chip to be placed face-up and six slots that hold a chip invisibly.  The board is arranged with a single recess at the center surrounded by an alternating pattern of recesses and slots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several different ways to play:  a basic game, two levels of advanced play, a children's version, and a variety of optional rules.  All follow the same basic theme:  after the board is set up with chips in some or all of the recesses and slots, players take turns drawing a chip for the center recess and looking for patterns of chips (generally lines or triangles) containing runs of consecutive numbers.  When a player spots a pattern on his or her turn, he or she takes one of the non-central chips from the pattern and moves the chip from the center of the board into the vacated spot.  If the player cannot find a pattern, the center chip is instead taken off the board as a &amp;quot;dead chip&amp;quot; that can be played later in place of a random draw.  Single-ring chips are wild, and double-ring chips allow other chips to be stolen from opponents.  The game ends when the chip supply is exhausted and no more dead chips can be played -- at this point, players add up the values of the chips they collected and subtract any dead chips to determine to winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the more advanced variations of the rules, legal patterns and playable areas of the board change so that slots are used more and more, adding a stronger element of memory to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
