							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Gobbler Game</name>
									
			<description>From the objective in the rule book:  &amp;quot;The object of the game is to depart from home, arrive at the hunting camp, go on a gobbler hunt and be the first to &amp;quot;Bag&amp;quot; your gobbler.&amp;quot;  Players roll a die to move along the paths in the woods.  Spaces include such activities as &amp;quot;Gas Stop&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Forgot Flashlight&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Stuck in Swamp&amp;quot;, all of which result in losing a turn.  There are also 3 decks of cards: Road Chance, Hunt Chance, and Phone Chance.  Also from the rule book, to win the game, &amp;quot;A player must roll the EXACT NUMBER ON THE DIE to get his gobbler or be lucky enough to draw the 'WINNER CARD' from the green chance pile.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
