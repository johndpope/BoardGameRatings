			<description>The Realm Online, originally known simply as The Realm, is a second generation MORPG (multiplayer online role playing game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Realm was launched in December 1996 for Windows PC. It was designed in the tradition of graphical MUDs, before the popular usage of the terms &amp;quot;massively multiplayer&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;MMORPG&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally published by Sierra On-Line, it was abandoned by that company because of its unfavorable comparison to Ultima Online and EverQuest. It was next taken up for a short time by a company called World Opponent Network which was also owned by Sierra On-line, then Codemasters, and presently is a Norseman Games production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Realm_Online The Realm Online]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
