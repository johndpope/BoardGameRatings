			<description>Herman's Castle is a game published as part of Chief Herman's Next Big Thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of an X-shaped grid representing the castle. Owners of the game supply their own colored stones (10 red, 10 blue, 10 yellow). On a player's turn he places a stone of any available color on any empty space in the castle. The player immediately scores points for placing stones of the same color next to each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
