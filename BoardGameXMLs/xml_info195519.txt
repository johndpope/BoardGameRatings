							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kingdom: An Enchanting Game</name>
									
			<description>Kingdom is a game where players battle against each other trying to be the first to match &amp;ldquo;The Ideal Kingdom&amp;rdquo; which needs to be made of the right collection of cards. However, the right cards needed in this game may not be the right cards in another game. True, you may pull the same set of cards, but it is highly unlikely there are 531,441 different combinations. You could push ahead getting the right cards in the positions you need them to be in, or do you work to thwart other players efforts. Adding the change a winning combination of the ideal kingdom allows for changes in strategy from one game to the next. Each player starts with three cards and needs to work to create the &amp;ldquo;Ideal Kingdom&amp;rdquo; which is a combination of six cards. Each color of card has specific attacks, defense, and special action. Certain colors cards can only sit next to other certain color cards, and coming in contact with opposing cards leads to inactivity or removal. That has something to do with court politics. Cards are drawn and played in turn order, with actions being directed by the cards you have laid out in front of you. Some of those actions allow you to draw extra cards, look at another player&amp;rsquo;s cards, steal cards, or battle. But, your strategy has to be planned so you can create the ideal kingdom to win. There are 9 major game changer cards in the deck, like creating Immunity from the Black Plague, or Jesters that will play tricks and change the cards. This actually helps the player with the least amount of cards to actually come back and try to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
