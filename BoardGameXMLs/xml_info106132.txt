			<description>From the playtest manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'There is a Greek legend that tells of a frozen land at the top of the world, a place many days sail beyond the most northerly human settlement. Here the cold sea is studded with floating mountains of ice, turning the waters into a frothing tempest that can crush the hulls of the strongest ships and freeze the bodies of the unfortunate sailors who dared to sail there. The land beyond the frozen sea is Ultima Thule.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wargods of Hyberborea is a tabletop miniatures game using metal miniatures that is closely related to Wargods of Aegyptus and Wargods of Olympus. Unlike many other tabletop miniatures wargames, the Wargods system uses hidden activation counters in order to simulate fog of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this reincarnation, players simulate massive battles in the land of Ultima Thule by taking control of a race of fierce creatures called the Wendigo, who are led to battle by formidable Ice Witches, masters of snow and wind. Although one off clashes occur frequently between warring factions, Wargods of Hyberborea offers dedicated warmongers an immersive game play experience through campaign play. In campaigns, players play through scenarios, progressing to differing scenarios and acquiring new special powers for their Wargod depending on who the victor is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
