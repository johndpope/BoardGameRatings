							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War Game: A Prototype for Peace</name>
									
			<description>This is a 2-player card-driven war game, in that you play cards and use your pieces to remove your opponent's pieces from the territories on the board. When both players no longer have any cards left in their hands, the game is over. How many cards each player will use before they empty their hands, however, is entirely up to him or her. At the end of the game, it is the players who decide who are the winners, and who are the losers. There are opportunities for both competitive and cooperative play, and a single game can have phases where each is present.  Table talk is encouraged, both during and after the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
