							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Martial Arts: The Card Game â€“ Series 2</name>
									
			<description>Introducing Series 2 of Martial Arts: The Card Game, a 2-4 player deckbuilding game that focuses on real martial arts rather than flying off walls and throwing fireballs. Using our Velocity Engine, you can pick up a deck and play as a different martial art style using strategy, speed, and quick thinking without having to micromanage your decks. Because this is also a deck building game, you can mix and match any of the cards from Series 2 or 1 and create your own fighting style, much like a honed practitioner would.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as &amp;quot;Anything Goes&amp;quot; where weapons and illegal moves are ok or try our different modes, like playing solo or Army of One where you can have up to 10 players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Series 2 includes these pre-constructed deck styles:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Sumo&lt;br/&gt;     Drunken Fist&lt;br/&gt;     Tae Kwon Do&lt;br/&gt;     Shaolin Kung Fu&lt;br/&gt;     Brazilian Jujitsu&lt;br/&gt;     Capoeira&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
