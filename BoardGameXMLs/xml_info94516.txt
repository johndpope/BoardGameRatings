			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Namco x Capcom is a crossover RPG title developed by Monolith Software. The game is set in the year 20XX, and two characters, Reiji Arisu and Xiaomu, are tasked with investigating a sleeping sickness in the Shibuya region of Japan. While they are investigating, characters from across time and space begin appearing and it becomes evident that something more dangerous is looming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay follows a typical RPG style &amp;ndash; players move and attack with units on their turn. Attacks can be modified by inputting button commands while the attack is taking place. Successfully executing commands will start more powerful combo attacks. Likewise, while defending, players need to input commands to mitigate the damage taken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a wide range of characters from across both Namco and Capcom&amp;rsquo;s game libraries. These include characters from the Darkstalkers, Final Fight, Street Fighter, Resident Evil, Tekken, Ghosts &amp;lsquo;n&amp;rsquo; Goblins, Mega Man Legends, and Dig Dug series, among others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
