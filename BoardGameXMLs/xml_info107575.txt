							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">33 Miners Board Game</name>
									
			<description>ABOUT THE GAME &lt;br/&gt;Mining was their only livelihood. It was expected to be a normal working day when suddenly the upper galleries of the gold and copper mine collapsed, causing the miners to be trapped for months. In this rescue mission game, you and your team must try to overcome all odds in order to rescue these thirty three (33) trapped miners. To be successful, you and your team must meet all the government&amp;rsquo;s mandatory health, safety and environment (HSE) standards, acquire the necessary gears, and endeavor to avoid danger zones. Remember, the perils and rewards are high - just when you think you are about to enter the chamber to rescue a trapped miner, your mission might suffer a setback as the other rescue team progresses. This game is about individual effort, team work, risk, strategy and sacrifice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 2 - 6. &lt;br/&gt;AGES: 12yrs to adult.&lt;br/&gt;PLAYING TIME: 45-60 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YOUR CHALLENGE &lt;br/&gt;Your team&amp;rsquo;s objective is to rescue as many trapped miners as possible. This process is not without its challenges such as: the unavailability of cash to acquire the necessary gears, risky danger zones, overcoming fluctuating gear costs imposed by the Greedy Merchant and the ability to meet the mandatory standards imposed by the government through its agency The Bureau of Standards. Lives are at stake! The longer you wait, the more unlikely it will be that the trapped miners will survive. Can you rise to the challenge? Only time will tell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME CONTENTS&lt;br/&gt;The game box consists of game rules and instructions, 1 board, 1 dice, 33 tokens (depicting the trapped miners), 6 player pawns, 6 rescue gear kits (or placeholders for the players&amp;rsquo; gears), 42 tokens (depicting the gears), 1 game price chart, 1 debtor sheet, 20 Bank Notes of $5, 30 Bank Notes of $10 and $20 respectively, 6 &amp;lsquo;holding card placeholders, and 2 decks of cards (HSE and Bureau of Standards). The deck of HSE cards are 35 in total and the deck of Bureau of Standards cards are 42 in total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
