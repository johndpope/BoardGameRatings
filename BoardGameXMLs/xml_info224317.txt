			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 3,700 years ago, Hammu-rapi reigned in Babylon.  Known today for his law code, this Amorite king took a minor city-state located on a branch of the Euphrates and created an empire which rivaled any the world had yet seen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Babylon On Which Fame and Jubilation Are Bestowed is a roleplaying game set in the world of Hammu-rapi, specifically the 25th year of his reign.  Whether players choose to situate their game in historic Mesopotamia, or in some fantastic variant, BFJB gives players and gamemasters the tools needed to experience the cultural milieu and personalities of Babylon in the eighteenth century BCE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this volume is a complete rule system, along with detailed entries on the peoples, cities and gods of the Kingdom of Babylon in 1767 BCE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
