							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Angelic Corruption</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Sins Shall Be Purged!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corruptions, from Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Horror Adventures, give players a new way to indulge their dark fantasies and take the role of gothic monsters, infecting themselves with some taint or darkness, and presenting the tantalizing question of whether to struggle against the corruption, or embrace it, and allow themselves to bask, however briefly, in its dark power. While Horror Adventures presents 11 different corruptions to choose from, there are many more potential sources of corruption that could potentially be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents the angelic corruption, a brand new corruption featuring unique progression rules, and 10 new manifestations that are flavorfully connected to angels and archons. Further, the book introduces the dominion archon, a new CR 12 archon which inhabits the bodies of mortals in order to do good in the world, and which can inflict the angelic corruption on those that it deems deserve it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
