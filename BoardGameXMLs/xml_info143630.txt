			<description>Play the 3 game challenges then win the right to be the Supreme Warrior of all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to collect two each of pizza and weapons tokens, and then reach the finish space to get your designated &amp;quot;bad guy&amp;quot;. Each player starts as either Michelangelo, Donatello, Raphael or Leonardo, and chooses the matching Battle Card. Each Battle Card has two spaces each for pizza and weapons tokens, and a designated bad guy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bad guys actually are just decoration, as they all wait together in the &amp;quot;hideout&amp;quot;, which is part of the finish space. Game play proceeds with each player spinning the spinner, advancing to the next space on single, linear path from start to finish that has the same color as the one just spun, and collecting either the pizza or weapon token found there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After playing the 3 games, winning players hold a spin-off to see who be the supreme warrior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
