			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An abstract game for 2 players. Players decide to either act as the Spirit of the Sun God or as Noble Explorers mistaken for Grave Robbers. While the Explorers work to find each other, the Spirit works to bring down the temple upon them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn consists of the two players selecting a certain number of spirit stones in secret. After the selection is complete the combined number of spirit stones of the two players determines the action for the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to escape if you are the Explorers, or stop the escape if you are the Spirits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
