							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">This Game Sucks</name>
									
			<description>Prepare to do battle with the greatest foe you have ever faced. It's more insidious than a secret agent, more cunning than a cyber-ninja and more devastating than than a three headed dragon with a hangover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Game Sucks places you in the battle of your life as you match wits with a bumbling GameMaster and his poorly planned plot lines. As you struggle to free yourself from the warped, twisted, and totally lame RPG you have landed in you will meet many familiar figures. Thwart the tedious ramblings of the Rules Lawyer. Berate the Closet Gamer as he is forced to make yet another excuse to his girlfriend. And find subtle cruel ways to torment the Gamer's Little Brother as you force the GM to finally give up all hope and quit the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
