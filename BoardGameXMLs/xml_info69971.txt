			<description>The game consists of 20 pieces, all of which are differently shaped. There are several suggestions for solitaire puzzles, but also a multiplayer game idea:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An architect and a master builder are chosen from among the players. The other players are builders. The master builder choses a piece as the base, the architect adds another piece on top of it (the pieces are interlocking). Then all players take turns adding another piece. The &amp;quot;building&amp;quot; has to remain stable and it is not allowed to block the next player. The players may hold the building while adding their piece; when they think it is stable they let go. If it collapses, the player who caused that is penalized, so is the architect. If all pieces are used up, all players get points with the architect getting a bonus. Several rounds are played and points are noted. When the players decide to end the game, the player with most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several versions of this game, using different materials: wood, aluminum etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
