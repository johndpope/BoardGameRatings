							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">StoryMax: Scenematic Roleplaying Game Rules</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game system lets you adventure in any imaginable setting by describing characters with your own colorful phrases and adjectives. Flexible and easy to learn, the rules can be adapted to everything from science fiction to fantasy, from pulp and super-heroic adventure to dark horror. StoryMax has its roots in Story Engine&amp;trade;, one of the original games to focus more on the narrative rather than cold, hard numbers. In order to play, you will need a bunch of willing players, handful of six-sided dice, pencils, paper, and plenty of imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in StoryMax are written using adjectives and phrases, creating unique roles with real personality. Abilities, disabilities, and threads are used to determine how many dice to roll. These elements can also be &amp;quot;burned&amp;quot; to gain advantages when they suit the scene. Like a novel, the different elements of the character all contribute to the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;StoryMax is still being developed. Because of this, certain rules and other elements may change in future versions. Many people have expressed interest in these rules, so we have released an early version to get it in your hands. Note that there are virtually no examples in this release, so feel free to ask questions. We would also appreciate any feedback you can provide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
