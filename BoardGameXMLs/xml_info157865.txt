			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;Requiem: Memento Mori is a horror-themed free-to-play MMORPG by Gravity. Players can choose between 4 races and 8 starting classes which each later branch into 2 specializations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features an accelerated day-night cycle with an &amp;quot;hour&amp;quot; of Nightmare time when more powerful monsters spawn in many corners of the world. Certain nightmare monsters have a chance of dropping special parts which may be combined by the player into a possession beast - a powerful alternate form the player can assume every time his hardcore gauge has filled completely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
