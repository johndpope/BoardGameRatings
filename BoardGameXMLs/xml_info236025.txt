							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lair of the Goblin King Grasnhak-Kul (S&amp;W)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For years, the small village of Vyndale has paid tribute to the goblin king Grasnhak-Kul by supplying food and wine to his horde on a monthly basis. It has been two years since the mayor of Vyndale, Jon Jabbiwaller, has protested the tribute. This resistance to the tribute resulted in a murderous goblin raid on the village and tremendous loss of life. With only three volunteer guards left to defend the village, the mayor is unable to ignore the demands of the goblin king.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the last three months, Grasnhak-Kul has increased his demands for additional supplies, which is already at near-impossible levels. The village is starving and can barely feed itself with what it has left after the tribute is paid. The mayor cannot risk any further suffering to his village by resisting the goblin king&amp;rsquo;s demands; he is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Mayor Jabbiwaller needs help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
