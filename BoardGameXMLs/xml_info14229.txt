							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">D-DAY: Rudder&#039;s Line</name>
									
			<description>Rudder&amp;rsquo;s Line is an AREA MOVEMENT game that simulates The Battle of Normandy, specifically the landing of the 2nd Ranger Battalion at Point du Hoc on D-Day, 6 June 1944. Players take the sides of the German 726th Infantry Regiment or elite US Army Rangers of the 2nd Ranger Battalion. Following an unprecedented invasion by landing and cliff-scaling in the face of enemy fire, the battle devolved into the quintessential hedgerow battle in Normandy&amp;rsquo;s bocage. The Rangers were literally &amp;lsquo;backs to the sea&amp;rsquo;, cut off from friendly forces until a relief column reached them from Omaha Beach on 8 June 1944. The German defenders pushed James Rudder and his men to the point of annihilation. It was a &amp;lsquo;near run thing&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br/&gt;The game depicts the hedgerow fighting that followed the D-Day landing of the 2nd Ranger Battalion. It is meant to be a hard-hitting, fast playing board game that recreates the close-in and deadly nature of the battle, fought for each individual field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale: The game is scaled at about 100 yards to the inch. Units for both sides are small groups of soldiers approximating squads, non-commissioned officers, FO&amp;rsquo;s, weapons crews, and individual machine-guns, mortars, and shoulder-fired Bazooka and Panzerschreck rocket launchers. Each game turn represents six hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Board: The game board uses a US Army map of the battlefield, divided into a collection of 35 numbered areas or &amp;lsquo;sectors&amp;rsquo;. Areas come in various shapes and sizes, with a dotted green border separating them. Each area contains two numbers: an identification number in a green box, and a Terrain Effects Modifier number (proceeded by a + sign) in a yellow circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What You Get:&lt;br/&gt;One 11&amp;quot; x 17&amp;quot; hard backed game board;&lt;br/&gt;80 color mounted die cut counters;&lt;br/&gt;One 4-page rulebook;&lt;br/&gt;Players must provide one or more six-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
