			<description>From the publisher's website &amp;quot;The Cat in the Hat has something mysterious in his hat! Can you guess what it is? In this fun, multisensory exploration game, one player hides a household object of their choice inside the hat and the other players use questions, clues, and the hat's fun interactive exploratory features to discover what it is. Is it something we eat? What room does it belong in? Not sure? Try feeling the hat with your elbows, poking your finger through a hole, or looking at the object through the magic crystalline window. Children will enjoy hours of creative fun with this innovative game!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONTENTS: &lt;br/&gt;1 Hat&lt;br/&gt;32 Exploration Cards&lt;br/&gt;1 Game Rules Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
