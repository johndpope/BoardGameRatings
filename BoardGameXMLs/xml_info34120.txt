							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jenga Cubes</name>
									
			<description>Jenga Cubes is part of the Jenga series of games.  The logo printed on the tower matches the Jenga logo on the rest of the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 25 dice-like black cubes, each with blue, green, and red faces.  The cubes stack nicely inside a Plexiglas tower that has slots cut out on alternating sides at each level (24 on the tower and 1 dislodged cube).  It is possible to carefully push out cubes leaving the above cubes in place by ensuring that that the remaining cube supports the ones above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules of the game differ from those of the traditional Jenga in which, the players will each be assigned a color (by way of rolling one of the dice) and will try to make one of the faces of the tower all of their color (e.g. orange player will try to make one of the faces of the tower orange).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn the player will roll the dislodged cube, and take the color face-up and push it against in the tower (using any side) until a cube on the opposite side falls out. If it is not possible to push that color, the dice is re-rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Note: if the cube that comes up lands with the face-up of your color, you get another turn (no limit on turns as long as your color keeps coming up).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
