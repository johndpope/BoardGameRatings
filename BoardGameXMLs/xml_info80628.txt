							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Styx</name>
									
			<description>Styx was an action maze game published by Bug-Byte Software in 1983. It was the first ZX Spectrum game written by Matthew Smith, and the first of his three-game contract with the company. He went on to write Manic Miner in the same year, as well as a sprite designer utility for Adrian Sherwin to use in developing The Birds and the Bees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sinclair User described the game as &amp;quot;reasonably lively&amp;quot;, whilst CRASH said the game &amp;quot;would not be interesting if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s not easy.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Styx,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
