			<description>Taken from the Warehouse 23 product description:&lt;br/&gt;The Jammer Sourcebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apes &amp;amp; Anarchy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jammers - outlaws from the future and renegades throughout time - are out to build a better tomorrow, or at least destroy the one that already exists. If these fanatical saboteurs get their way, the history of the world will no longer be subject to the forces of feng shui and all chi will be burned from the planet. To the Jammers, destiny is dug from the rubble of revolution and the course of history always goes boom!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gorilla Warfare is the first no-holds-barred excursion into the secret, underground lairs of the Jammers, from the demon-infested past of 69 A.D. to the dystopian tomorrow of the Buro. The Jammers hold sway over no single era but instead charge screaming from the Netherworld into any time frame. Now, with technologically altered soldiers, spies, and informants positioned underneath every major front in the Secret War, the Jammers are ready to ignite the fuels of rebellion and blow the Secret War wide open.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gorilla Warfare examines the bombs, bunkers, tactics, and mechanized apes that make up the Jammers. Inside, you'll find the resources that players and GMs need to bring the noise to their own Feng Shui games: new platoons of simian soldiers, from submersible units to aerial units; the Ape Factory, where new Jammers are made; the all-new hardware schticks, so you too can be horribly mutilated in the name of military superiority; and battle-plans for the next stage of Jammer operations all over the globe. Whether you work with the Jammers or against them, this book gives you access to the bomb before it goes off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
