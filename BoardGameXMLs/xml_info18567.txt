							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Phantom&#039;s Vortex</name>
									
			<description>Print and play game with a monster theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In this game, you're one of four Phantoms racing around a crumbling Druidic Temple, hoping to be the&lt;br/&gt;first to take control of the VORTEX (which controls all space and time, binds the universe together, and&lt;br/&gt;picks up FM radio like you wouldn't BELIEVE)! You'll have to battle the fearsome Sentinels that guard&lt;br/&gt;these ruins, and your opponents will be attacking you with a variety of horrible creatures. This game's&lt;br/&gt;very easy to learn to play, so phantoms of all ages can enjoy it. And once a few Phantom's start&lt;br/&gt;hurling savage ravenous monstrosities at each other... well, it's sure to be a fun time!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
