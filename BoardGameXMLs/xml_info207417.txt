							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Marvel Universe Miniature Game: The Dark Avengers Starter Set</name>
									
			<description>This game is a small scale skirmish level game where Superheroes and Villains face off against each other in a 3D tabletop set up. It could be a city, the Wakandan desert, the Savage Lands, the blue area of the moon or anything you like. In Marvel they fight anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;It is played on a 36&amp;quot; x 36&amp;quot; board so will fit on most tables without a problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a game you will usually have between 4-7 characters on your team. Each of these characters act individually using their own Power to carry out different attacks and use Special Powers.&lt;br/&gt;Many can help or hinder each others though with boosts and actions like a Fastball Special.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to win set scenarios by completing different tasks and scoring Victory Points. These could be anything from take down / save the highest Level model in the team or rescue and keep a Cosmic Relic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character comes with their own Stat Card which shows everything they can do. Attacks, Defence, Skills, Power, Damage and such.&lt;br/&gt;These are then used in a 2 D8 mechanic during the game. For example, 2D8 plus Attack Stat vs Defence Stat or 2D8 against your own Agility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reformed supervillain Norman Osborn, now calling himself the Iron Patriot, was given leadership of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. He reformed that agency into H.A.M.M.E.R. and created a new Avengers team under its aegis. The line-up consists of former Thunderbolts members and new recruits Sentry and Ares, as well as disguised super-villain Moonstone who is portraying Ms. Marvel. Using the Dark Avengers as a cover Norman declared war on the Asgardians, and has the Dark Avengers prepare for the Siege of Asgard. Norman considered The Sentry, specifically his dark side, known as The Void, his secret weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
