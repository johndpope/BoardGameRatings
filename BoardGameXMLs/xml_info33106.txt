			<description>Quick, simple luck-driven card/dice-gambling game. As part of the Cirkle Series, dice and cards have the same symbols (cross, circle, square, triangle) and colours (yellow, green, purple, blue) as each of these games, plus one added colour (black) and symbol (target).&lt;br/&gt;Of each symbol/colour-combination there is one of the 24 Cards and it is on one of the total 24 sides of the dice.&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in 3 rounds, &amp;ldquo;attacking&amp;rdquo; player (with the dice) and &amp;ldquo;defending&amp;rdquo; player (with the cards) changing roles.&lt;br/&gt;At the first round the defending player gets all the cards, chooses 4 of them and places them in front of him. The attacking player now throws his 4 dice three times and gets all the matching cards and the points on them. The cards still on the table go to the &amp;ldquo;defending&amp;rdquo; player. After 6 times, the cards are used up, and both players count their score.&lt;br/&gt;The second round players change roles.&lt;br/&gt;After this, the player with the higher score decides, which player gets which role in the third round. Who wins this third round, wins the whole game. In a variant, players play only two rounds and the higher total score determines the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are more rules available, one kind of &amp;ldquo;Yahtzee&amp;rdquo;, and one tactical &amp;ldquo;memory&amp;rdquo;-variant, using only the dice or the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
