			<description>This is primarily an educational tool to structure learning about starting and operating a business.  It is not intended to be played in a single sitting, but instead paces, adds random elements, and &amp;quot;keeps score&amp;quot; over the span of a entire business or economics class.  It was created by a student group at North Central College in Naperville IL (&amp;quot;...just 29 miles from downtown Chicago.&amp;quot; per to game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will create business goal for a cookie making firm,  eventually describing marketing, financial, and operational plans.  The game tests these plans through the use of randomly drawn cards that create variations and alternatives for the students to cope with and learn from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The production value is decent, with a fully mounted folding board.  The documentation included with the game is excellent.  There is a teacher's manual, blank and example business plans, blank cards of all four types to allow customization, and an instruction sheet for playing the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
