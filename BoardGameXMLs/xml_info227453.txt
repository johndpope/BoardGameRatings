			<description>Colonnade is a column building game that uses just a standard deck of cards and 6 dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players add cards to a 6 column Colonnade according to the dice they roll. You gain control of a column by placing more cards on it than your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;And you can push your luck for better dice combos that will give a greater choice of ways to play your cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who controls the majority of columns at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are on just one sheet of paper and include examples of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colonnade was an entry in the 2017 Two-Player Print and Play Game Design Contest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
