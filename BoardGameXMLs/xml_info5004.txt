			<description>Hauberk: The Ultimate Game of Intellectual Cunning, is how this game is billed.  The side of the box reads &amp;quot;A game of ruses and rescue.&amp;quot;  And according to the rule book, the objective is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To rescue the Princess by entering the castle where she is located after you have become a Player Knight.  Though you are courageous as a Squire, and possess the ability to locate the Princess, you lack the power to save her.  Only as a Player Knight may you accomplish your task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It appears that a player can accumulate artifacts and cards to progress towards being a &amp;quot;player knight.&amp;quot;  Then if he or she can enter the castle (where the princess is), that person wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seems much like a 1970s fantasy video game combined with The Mystic Wood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Was once on the Games Magazine Top 100 games list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
