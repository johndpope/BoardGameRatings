			<description>You can enjoy a new Auxiliary Weapon &amp;ndash; the Chainsaw, huge PvP enhancements, the Albion Theatre, Reticule Combat and a new set of Missions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrible creatures from beyond are attacking New York City. The players must band together in groups of ten to take on this threat. They will travel through the subways, streets and buildings of the city before arriving at Times Square for the showdown with the final boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our Player vs. Player systems are also getting a huge boost in this Issue. There are new missions in Fusang Projects and the PVP reward system is getting a revamp. These changes give the conflict between the Secret Societies more meaning, persistence and make it even more rewarding. Balance in the fight between Secret Societies is also being closely looked at, both for minigames and in the Warzone. An example of this is the new Underdog mission in Fusang, where the weakest side can gain the help of a powerful Custodian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another brand new feature is the Albion Theatre in London. Here teams of players can rent the stage and put on any plays their creative minds can dream up. They can choose between using a host of backdrops, setpieces, cutouts, effects and sounds to set the stage exactly as they like. They can then tell other players about their show in the city wide chat channel, in Agartha or in the forums, so anyone can come and watch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
