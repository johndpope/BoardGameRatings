			<description>From the publishers blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mrs. Wyverstone has a simple job he needs done. She has a home she wants built. The foundation has already been laid, but her building crew has abandoned the job. She needs a crew to go in and finish the job. She says any able-bodied idiot can do it. So why is she hiring adventurers?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 6-8 hour adventure for 1st to 3rd level characters. It was written for Pathfinder, but it can easily be adapted for 5e or other editions of the world's oldest and greatest role playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
