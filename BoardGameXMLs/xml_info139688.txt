							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Storming the Citadel</name>
									
			<description>Game comes with 2 tinplate cannons, card central keep, 2 walls, 4 towers, 10t 'flats' of 25mm scale infantry of the line and 15 pieces of ammunition. The rules are inside the lid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Game is played on the floor or table, one player undertaking the defence and the other, (or others), the attack.&lt;br/&gt;Stand the Fort up. The towers will hinge into position. Then there are numerous instructions to complete the fort and that depended on how much you paid for the game. If you didn't have all the items mentioned in the instructions, then you had to make do. Chad Valley obviously made several editions of this game. Finally, the 15 discs are laid out as instructed. These represent trenches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The defender places his Cannon, (provided in the betier editions), at one side of the Fort, and the attackers then send one man to the first Disc (or Trench), that is,thee the two furthest from the Fort; the defender then endeavours to shoot this man, and should he miss, the attacker may then move forward to the next Trench, or bring np another man as he considers best, when the defender again fires, and so on in turn, the object of the attacker, (or storming party), being to occupy the three Trenches nearest the Fort, each with one man, and if successful in this the attackers are then said to &amp;ldquo;charge&amp;rdquo; and the Fort is taken. If, however, the defence kill sufficient numbers of the attackers to prevent the three front Trenches being occupied, he has repulsed the assault and wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soldiers having reached the front trench cannot be fired&lt;br/&gt;at. Should the defender exhaust his supply of ammunition he must miss one shot while a fresh supply is obtained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
