			<description>The Fast and The Furious (ファスト・アンド・フュリアス) is based on the film series of the same name; particularly, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. It should not be confused with The Fast and the Furious arcade game, which was later ported to the Nintendo Wii as Cruis'n (due to the publisher losing the license rights).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game features many different races that may take place on the Wangan, or on the local mountain roads called Touge. There are two types of races that can take place on the Wangan: Destination Races - a simple point to point race, and Top Speed Battles - whoever can set the highest speed record in between the start and finish wins. The Touge also features two events: Grip Battles - point to point race going uphill or downhill through tight Hairpin Turns, and Drift Battles - whoever can accumulate the most points by the end of the run wins. Throughout the Wangan are several exits which can lead to hotspots - where Wangan races can be started, touges, Car Dealerships, tune shops, and Robo-Garages. These garages were featured in the movie The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. There are 8 different dealerships where vehicles can be purchased: Nissan dealership, Mitsubishi dealership, Mazda dealership, Honda dealership, Toyota dealership, Subaru dealership, Lexus dealership, and a U.S. Naval Base - where according to the instruction booklet included with the game, cars are brought over by stationed soldiers who end up selling them or are just imported. The tune shops are spread over the map and offer performance upgrades, visual upgrades, and paint jobs which are free and fully customizable by the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes many Japanese cars such as the Mazda RX-7, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, Subaru Impreza WRX STI, Toyota Supra, Honda NSX and the Nissan Skyline. There are also some American cars such as the Chevrolet Corvette Z06 and the Shelby GT500.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2003, an anticipated game with the same name was developed and then cancelled. The two games were released by two different developers however, (the cancelled game by Genki; the released game by Eutechnyx), and were not related in any way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Fast and the Furious (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
