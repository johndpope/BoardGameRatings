			<description>This is an electioneering game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Snap Election has been called and you are a candidate.&lt;br/&gt;To get elected you need to win the votes of half the electorate. This means canvassing 6 groups of voters on 6 separate policies. It also means outsmarting your opponents, who may be out to win at any cost.&lt;br/&gt;This is politics , remember, the playground of sleaze and the graveyard of principles. We are about to find out what kind of politician you really are!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
