			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Crazy Devils gang is making inroads into new turf, they made the mistake of picking the turf where the heroes live. Dragged into gang warfare not of their making the heroes must survive and fight back. The gang are fighting for the real estate, the heroes are fighting for their homes, justice and a big pile of credits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Real Estate is a One-Sheet adventure ideal for introducing players and novice characters to Interface Zero 2.0. It can easily be adapted for any tier of heroes. It can be run on its own or lead into a more complex adventure for the heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One-Sheet adventures are designed to be run with minimal prep and contain enough content for a game session or two. These adventures are also great as filler in longer campaigns, to use as a spring board for a longer adventure, or just to mix it up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
