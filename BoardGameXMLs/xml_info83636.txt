							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pentology Card Game</name>
									
			<description>From the website. &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.pentologygames.com&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.pentologygames.com&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pentology is an adventure card game. While the core mechanics remain constant, the cards are designed for use in any number of different games. It is most comparable to a standard fifty-two card deck of playing cards. Although it does not have suits and numbers, jacks or queens, Pentology does allow mathematically sound strategy; group, team or solo play; simplicity or complexity; all with the same deck of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pentology further provides players with a backdrop fantasy theme for every game. With Pentology cards, solitaire games become a mission of saving your allies and defeating your nemesis; poker style games suggest the fun of defining the characteristics of your own hero, and then pitting her strengths against your opponent's; and blackjack feels like a quick skirmish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Standard playing cards have long been popular because of the vast number of games that can be played with a single deck. Pentology cards boast that same value. Each deck includes a rulebook with rules for five different games, and as creative enthusiasts come up with new game rules and post them on the forum, the list of available games will grow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of online community, players can continually find new games, contribute their own ideas, and vote on which games to standardize.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
