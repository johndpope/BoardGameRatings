			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Question: Do you love d20 and do you love Clerics?&lt;br/&gt;Question: Do you want a cleric that gives you a little extra something?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maybe we have what your looking for in our new product: UNORTHODOX CLERICS! This 25 page pdf contains 5 New Clerics for you to use in any d20 fantasy world. Each Cleric comes with a detailed background, new abilities, and some new progression charts that will make you say ?yowza yowza yowza?.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book details the following five new Clerics:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Chosen: Warrior priests dedicated to the works of their god.&lt;br/&gt;     The Cultist: They are liars, cheaters, and fanatics. (Maybe we should have called them &amp;quot;politicians&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;     The Elementalist: They walk a delicate balance between the four elements, maintaining a precious balance that could consume them if they loose control. &lt;br/&gt;     The Inquisitor: NO ONE EXPECTS THE INQUISITOR&lt;br/&gt;     The Priest: They walk the path of enlightenment, but is able to fight undead better than their standard cleric counterpart. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
