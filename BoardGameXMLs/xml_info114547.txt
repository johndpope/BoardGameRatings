			<description>The kingdom of Altago is rebuilding around a newfound peace after years of war against the merciless armies of Romn. Battle-hardened adventurer, Adol (and his trusty wall-crushing companion, Dogi) arrive in the harbor of Altago City and quickly find themselves in a scuffle with the kingdom's military police body, the Dragon Knights. The result is jail time on a false espionage charge, which captures the attention of Altago's regent. One thing leads to another, and a chain of events is set in motion that ultimately guides Adol and Dogi on a quest across the land to learn more about its estranged local gods: the Five Great Dragons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join Adol, Dogi and their many new companions as they explore this borderline new country and undertake a journey to save it all from monsters, bandits, political saboteurs and - of course - long-forgotten ancient forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Altago. Get ready for a wild ride.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
