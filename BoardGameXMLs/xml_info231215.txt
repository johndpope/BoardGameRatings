			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Muziris was a bustling port town on India's coast. In Merchants of Muziris, a card game for two, players are merchants at the supplier gathering goods to sell on their stands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card is one of ten different goods, and features a scoring set and special ability. The supply features 4 face up good cards each turn. On a player's turn, they may use two characters to perform actions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Merchant: Add a card from the supply to their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Advisor: Use the Special Ability of a card in the supply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Beggar: Draw cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Customer: Make an order using the goods in their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player may not use the same character twice in a single turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the game ends (after a certain number of orders have been made), players score points for their sales, as well as any other bonuses they have received.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
