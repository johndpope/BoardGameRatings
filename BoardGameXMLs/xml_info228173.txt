The Suites are: Military (M), Building (B), Culture (C), and Wealth (W). A Card with 2 types listed can be used for either.  &lt;br/&gt;-  Some cards are unique (removed from the game at the end of the turn it is used), others can be only be used in the middle and/or late ages.&lt;br/&gt;-  Disaster (D) have no suite and no level bonus.

These are &amp;ldquo;face-down&amp;rdquo;, only the owning player can see them. &lt;br/&gt;3. Action Phase&lt;br/&gt;-  Step 1 - Each player selects one card from their hand and places it face up on the table in front of them. &lt;br/&gt;-  Step 2 - Players then pass their hand to the next player (on odd turns the next player is to the left, on even turns, to the right) &lt;br/&gt;-  Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all cards are played to the table. Each player should have 7 cards face up in front of them.&lt;br/&gt;4. Scoring Phase&lt;br/&gt;-  For each suite each player adds up the levels of all their cards in that suite. The player with the highest total level in a Suite gets 2 Victory Tokens.  If 2 or more players tie for highest, each one gets 1 VT. &lt;br/&gt;-  If you have cards from all 4 Suites gain 2 VT. &lt;br/&gt;5. End Phase&lt;br/&gt;-  All cards played this turn go to the discard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after 7 turns.  The player with the most VT (Victory Tokens) at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
