			<description>&amp;quot;You are racing your turtle to be the first in the Winner's Circle. Howeve, along the way, you must get special instructions from Professor Nod. He can help you win - or lose - so try to please him!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a fairly basic spin-and-move game with the addition of a plastic &amp;quot;Professor Nod&amp;quot; figure which is used to allow or disallow certain actions. If a player wishes to take a shortcut, ends a turn on an opponent's space, or lands on a &amp;quot;Spin Again&amp;quot; space, that player must push a &amp;quot;Question Card&amp;quot; into the base of the Professor Nod figure. If he nods, the move is acceptable, if he shakes his head to the side the move is denied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
