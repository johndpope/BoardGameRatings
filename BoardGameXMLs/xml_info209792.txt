							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Duck Shooting</name>
									
			<description>This is an early but undated shooting game from Parker Brothers. It consists of an 11.5&amp;quot; long metal and wood spring-loaded rifle, 0.6&amp;quot; long wooden bullets, 9 cardboard ducks held upright by small metal stands, and a decorated platform with 9 spots for the ducks. The spots have point values: 2 x 5; 2 x 10; 2 x 15; 2 x 25; and 50.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box lid is placed upside down on the floor. The box is inserted vertically to form a backdrop, and the target platform fits in front of that. Standing &amp;quot;a few feet away&amp;quot;, players get three shots each, and score points for each duck hit equal to the value of its spot. The targets are reset after each player turn. The first player to reach 500 points over multiple rounds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
