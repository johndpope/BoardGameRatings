							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battles by Gaslight</name>
									
			<description>Battles by Gaslight is based on the popular Gaslight Victorian science fiction rules, but is designed to allow players to fight larger battles with several players each controlling four or more units.  Game mechanics have been streamlined to allow players to control more units; however, the flavor of Gaslight has been retained.  48 pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units in Gaslight generally consist of ten figures led by one or more Main Characters, in Battles by Gaslight this is expanded so that a player will control three or four entire units each led by a (Main Character) Commander which are in turn led by an overall Army Commander. A player may also control vehicles and their crews. The games are a combination of unit actions and individual heroism in the tradition of adventure novels and swashbuckling films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Command and control is accomplished now through a combination die roll and card-draw turn system. Movement is based on moving entire units as they activate, keeping them within distance of their Commander. Firing is done by units as a whole now instead of individual figures like in Gaslight (although Main Character Commanders may fire separately) and the firing procedure is still very streamlined. Morale is handled in a similar fashion to Gaslight with minor adjustments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The authors made the specific design choice not to build their own world for these rules.  Instead the rules allow for the use of any vehicles, weapons, and creatures that players desire for their personal perception of Victorian science fiction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
