			<description>The Duchy of Elster lies on the idyllic isle of Lindoss and has enjoyed decades of peace and prosperity. However, all that is about to come to an end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two years ago, the Duke's only son Sebastian fled with his lady love Elaine after his father refused to allow them to marry. They were last seen on the day they left the castle, near the Cave of Oracles. The Duke had given up searching for the pair, but failing health has created a potential issue of succession. Waiting in the wings is the Duke's bastard half-brother Rodrick, a petty and cruel-hearted tyrant who dreams of ascending to rule the duchy.  The Duke, in one last desperate attempt to find his son, has offered a hefty rewared to anyone who can find and return the pair of lovers.  Having recently arrived on the island, the party is drawn by the promised reward. Will they succeed where all others have failed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Enchanted garden is an adventure front for the Dungeon World RPG. It presents the skeleton of a complete adventure, inspired by a classic old-school module. With it and a minimal amount of prep work, a GM has enough material for several sessions of play, as well as the set-up for a longer campaign arc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
