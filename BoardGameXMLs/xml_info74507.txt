			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;Deep beneath the surface, an ancient war still rages, now you must choose your side - but choose carefully&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Millennia ago, the elves of the Elenon Mountains were the envy of all -- beautiful, strong and wise.

Now the dark elves live in exile, the hated rivals of the elves of the light -- including the battered remnants of their mysterious twilight elf kin. Whether you become a bloodthirsty dark elf cleric, a dark elf fighter exiled for her purity and goodness, or even an honorable twilight elf soldier, this book gives you the knowledge, the skills and the equipment to begin your adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blood &amp;amp; Shadows is loaded with Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons (v3.5 Edition) material, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Two Elven Subraces!
