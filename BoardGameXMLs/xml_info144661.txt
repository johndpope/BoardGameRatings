			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cascadia Adventures 3: Fled is the final chapter in a trilogy of adventures by Gypsy Knights Games set in the Cascadia subsector of the Clement Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thousands of credits stolen from the Razz Casino on Chance is just the beginning!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Milton &amp;quot;The Monk&amp;quot; Hawthorne, security officer, has robbed the Razz Casino and fled the system.  Carrie O'Malley, owner of the casino, has hired the crew of MV Dust Runner to locate Hawthorne and recover the stolen money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, Hawthorne may have far bigger plans including an act of revenge that may change the course of Cascadian politics forever.  Is Hawthorne a mad genius?  Or just a pawn in a far greater conspiracy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can the characters stop Hawthorne?  Can they recover the money?  Or will they become casualties of the rough and tumble world of Cascadian politics?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cascadia Adventures 3: Fled comes with an exciting adventure, nine pre-generated characters, and tons of NPCs.  In addition, Fled features stats and deckplans for the Rucker-class ship, a common &amp;quot;oddjob&amp;quot; ship in the Clement Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although Cascadia Adventures 3: Fled can be modified for use in any Traveller setting, it is recommended that Referees have access to Subsector Sourcebook 1: Cascadia and Hub Federation to make full use of this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all our products, the main intention of this book is to provide an extra spark to the Referee's imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
