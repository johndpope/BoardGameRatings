							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Secret Inheritance</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Secret Inheritance is set in the town of Eisental in Ostermark, sheltered in a valley in the midst of the Gryphon woods, but it could be moved to another town or village of comparable size anywhere in the north or the east of The Empire if need be. The adventure has been designed with relatively inexperienced characters in mind, but can easily be adapted to suit more seasoned campaigners; a session or two should be enough to resolve the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It begins with the PCs making their way through the depths of a great forest. The promise of a particularly savage storm causes them to break their journey for a few days and take shelter in a small town. There, they get drawn into a local struggle for control of a guild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
