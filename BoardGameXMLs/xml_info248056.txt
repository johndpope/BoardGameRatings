			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The true wonders of Arcana are explored in the monthly journals. Each issue focuses on a hex or faction within the game world, offering rumors, hidden lore, and detailed descriptions of all the important sites and people. Full-color maps (also offered in print-easy black and white) are provided, plus all sites of worthwhile note, such as towns and major adventure sites. Floor plans of castles and other locations are also offered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to this detailed write-up, each issue will also focus on other aspects of the game world, its history, important people, the Magi and gaming classes. When you add it all up, these journals take the mundane and make it magical. It is through the journals that the Arcana game world will grow, expand, and become a living place of adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue includes&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    House Sharbben&lt;br/&gt;    Innof the Sleeping Magi&lt;br/&gt;    The Magus Norcal&lt;br/&gt;    Arcana Breasts, Unicorns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
