							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Obitu</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let this new race for the Pathfinder Role Playing Game warm your bones...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the darkest corner, Lord Varquil the Lich plotted. Legions of his undead clashed with the holy power of the temple brethren yet again. The dreaded army of bone and blade lost yet again. This was but another defeat in a long series of losses, and Varquil needed to change his strategy. Martial quietus filled the land for nearly a century, and many assumed the old lich had finally met his maker. However, nothing could be further from the truth. A new breed was being developed: undead imbued with life&amp;mdash;true life. The obitu were to be a life force as docile and obedient as his other minions with one marked difference; they were technically living, breathing entities. This made the obitu immune to turning and other pitfalls common to his other low level soldiers. Best of all, they shared the same visage as his favorite shock troops, the skeleton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created by infecting undead with an arcane disease, the numbers of obitu grew quickly to the thousands. As they marched towards the distant citadel, something else began to grow as well; their free will. By the time the temple bastion was in sight, many obitu already began to doubt the wisdom of serving an evil master. The worst defeat that Varquil ever suffered was at the hands of his own creation. The obitu rapidly converted to the goodly faith and became a bane to undead ever since. So wrap your boney fingers around that broadsword, march to the clatter of skeletal feet, and pull back that hood to reveal your undying smile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
