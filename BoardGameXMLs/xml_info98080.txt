							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Weird West Roleplaying Game Basic Rulebook</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;The streamlined and fast playing adventure roleplaying game for weird western worlds of cowboys, kung-fu, magic and otherworldly malevolence.&lt;br/&gt;The Weird West Basic Rulebook has been designed to make reading, creating characters, and starting a game as fast as possible: the fastest RPG in the west! We've cut out the 'what is an rpg', game fiction, and other 'fluff' to keep the rulebook as lean as possible while still having enough detail to make it fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This purchase includes both a PDF version suitable for reading on your computer, iPad or iPhone (with bookmarks) and a special 'PocketMod' PDF version for printing. The PocketMod version lets you create your own 4.25&amp;quot; x 2.75&amp;quot; sized game books from a single sheet of paper. Take a copy to read on the go, and print one to give to each of your players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;admin comment&lt;br/&gt;the two PDFs are sold as a package, we have decided to  list them as two versions, not a one version bundle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
