							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Abbernoth Campaign Setting</name>
									
			<description>Author's introduction:&lt;br/&gt;The driving concept in the creation of The Abbernoth Campaign Setting has been what I have come to refer to as understated fantasy, the idea that magick isn&amp;rsquo;t overt or common and that heroes and villains are believable characters who are exceptional not necessarily for their preternatural strength or abilities, but rather for their actions and their deeds. My goal has been to present a high fantasy setting in a recognizable and relatable way in a world that is wholly believable and internally consistent. I sincerely hope that this humble work is well received and that the Westerlands will be enjoyed by you, dear reader, as much as it is for this humble author. So welcome to Abbernoth and may the sun shine down upon you as you travel its roads, and my the shadows be forever kept at bay&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;This setting sourcebook is available as a free download from Dragonsfoot.org&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
