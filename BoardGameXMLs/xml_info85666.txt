							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Raptor Class Gunship</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Raptor Class design was created in response to a military request for a new gunship. Growing threats along the borders of several systems necessitated that this new design enter production as quickly as possible, bypassing the usual research and development (R&amp;amp;D) phase usually associated with new ships. Several ship builders were invited to submit designs for this new contract, titled XG-203. In the end, the Lockdyne corporation received the production contract as none of the other participants could meet the tight production and IOC (Initial Operational Capability) for the first squadron of ships. Lockdyne had been able to meet this timetable by utilizing an off-the shelf approach to many of the ship&amp;rsquo;s systems and basing the design on the commercially successful C-477 cargo ship. The original contract called for a vessel that would incorporate the new Bruning PPC-4 Plasma Pulse Cannon in addition to the usual compliment of energy weapons and missile batteries. Lockdyne engineers realized that the new ship would essentially be &amp;lsquo;built around&amp;rsquo; this new weapon due to its massive size. By making modifications to the existing C-477 design they were able to meet the IOC requirement and bring the project in under budget. Changes to the C-477 design included moving the cockpit right of center to make room for the PPC-4 cannon and related equipment and the addition of &amp;ldquo;wings&amp;rdquo; to accommodate the experimental dual Speer XM33 burst guns which were ordered into production for this contract. The XM33 design had not finished its testing when production was ordered, and the design still had one major flaw to overcome. The weapon delivered the expected energy output, but the gun itself emitted a short surge or radiation each time it was fired. To overcome this the decision was made to mount the guns at the ends of two &amp;ldquo;wings&amp;rdquo; that would give the necessary distance to protect the crew from any hazards associated with the guns use. The engineers saw an opportunity with these new structures and proceeded to incorporate a new Lockdyne design for magnetic shield emitters into the wing structures. This new design proved highly effective and may be utilized in future Lockdyne ships. The first ship served as the sole prototype/test craft, and after just a month of trial runs full production proceeded on schedule. The production vessel was designated the G-203. While some minor improvements have been introduced throughout the production, no sub-designator has been issued for the design. An advanced version is rumored to be in development by the Lockdyne Corporation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
