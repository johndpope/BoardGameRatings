							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mighty Max Super Battle Card Game</name>
									
			<description>A version of the card game &amp;quot;war&amp;quot; (flip cards, high number captures, if there's a tie ante more cards into the pile and re-flip) themed on the Mighty Max toy line (and cartoon, and video game...) from the mid-1990's.  The 53-card deck has values from one to twelve, with only one twelve, two elevens, and five of every other number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box: &amp;quot;The Deadly Doom Zone Dwellers are back and you and Mighty Max must capture them all to win.  Be ready at all times in this fast action card game where battles escalate into Super Battles -- instantly.  The stakes get higher and higher as you add cards to the battlefield.  Then the highest card takes everything and you begin again til one player conquers the others, by taking all the cards and becomes the winner!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
