							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Secrets of the Lion</name>
									
			<description>Dual system sourcebook for Legend of the Five Rings and Oriental Adventures examining the Lion Clan in Rokugan. Something of a sequel to the Way of the Lion, it brings the description up to date with the metaplot timeline of L5R 2e. While these volumes contain player options and information, they're primarily a GM resource as spoiler information and secrets are interspersed throughout the text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Ha. What secrets could the Lion have that I need to learn?&amp;quot; - Crane Champion Doji Kuwanan, shortly before the Ancestral Sword of the Lion was stolen from him by Kitsu Osen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secrets of the Lion takes you deep within the lands of the Lion Clan, exposing their history, culture, organization, and secrets for the first time. Far more than the simple soldiers the Empire believes them to be, the Lion Clan are a multi-faceted group with depths that most outsiders will never understand. Within, you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Insight into the culture of the Lion Clan and the families that comprise it.&lt;br/&gt;     Information on the major and minor holdings of each Lion family, complete with points of interest, notable individuals, and suggestions on how to incorporate these elements into character backgrounds and adventures.&lt;br/&gt;     An examination of the mysterious and enigmatic Kitsu Tombs, complete with all the information necessary to use it as a focal point in your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;     The true secrets of the Lion Clan - the dark, forgotten shames that they hide from outsiders . . . and themselves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a dual-system supplement for the Legend of the Five Rings Role-Playing Game, Second Edition, and Rokugan, the d20 Companion for Legend of the Five Rings. Players and DMs may also find it useful as a source of interesting new feats and abilities for any d20 System campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters running the Second Edition L5R RPG will need a copy of the Legend of the Five Rings Game Master's Guide and the Player's Guide. Players need only the Player's Guide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Masters running d20 System games will need a copy of the Player's Handbook, the Dungeon Master's Guide, Oriental Adventures, and Rokugan. Players will need only a Player's Handbook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
