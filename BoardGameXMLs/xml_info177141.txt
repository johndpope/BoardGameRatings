Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harem is an adult video game for the Atari 2600. It was made by Multivision in 1982 but never released until it was eventually rediscovered and released online for free in 2007. 2600 fans still debate what the actual theme was supposed to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place on a single multi-tiered screen where the player must defeat four challenges. In the first challenge you try to get past a sniper shooting at you from behind a bush. In the second challenge you must cross a river. In the third challenge you try to elude a fire breathing dragon and, in the fourth challenge, you must dodge lava spewing gargoyles. After (sometimes during) each challenge the player has coitus with a female which is where points are scored. A player scoring sixty nine points receives a free life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
