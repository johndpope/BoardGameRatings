			<description>Parang is a card game from Borneo, with a theme of headhunting shown through the artwork. The aim is to collect the most head trophies from victory cards. These are separated into three piles with 1, 2 and 3 skulls (Antu Pala) respectively. Players have identical hands of 9 cards and bid simultaneously on each of the three piles; a complete round thus consists of three mini-rounds. Generally speaking the highest valued card wins, but identical cards cancel each other, and there are some other special cases. Ties are broken through a rock-paper-scissors mechanism based on the cards in the tie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
