			<description>The collapse occurred in winter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At first the losses were isolated and simple. As time progressed, the spread claimed more and with it came revolution. The Government fell shortly after, and the many who had 'just in case' emergency plans, found themselves in isolation. Some lost their minds and others simply starved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The few of us that remain are left in a bleak and desolate landscape. Supplies are scarce and the enemy is strengthening, but we all share the will to survive. With what little hope remains, we band together and make our Last Stand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last Stand is a cooperative survival simulation. Players will find themselves in a massive city with dwindling resources that is slowly being overrun with Infected. During the day, players can explore and take actions. They will have many opportunities to build bases, get supplies, assign survivors, fight and make use of special abilities. When Night falls, the Infected roam, but they are not the only threat. Starvation, sickness and the loss of humanity are a few of the other dangers that await.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
