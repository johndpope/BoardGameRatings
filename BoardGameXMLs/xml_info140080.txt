			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your world was exciting, at first. You had been called upon to do great things, to battle fearsome enemies and rescue beautiful princesses. However, little by little you began to realize your life was not your own- your very will was being controlled by some unseen force, bent on having you perform the same actions again and again. Your world wasn&amp;rsquo;t fun anymore, but what could you do? When that force took you over, there was no resisting it. Until one day when there was a sudden jarring, and you were left standing in your world waiting for that force to guide your actions. It never came. And then something extraordinary happened- a sprite you had never seen before stood before you and said &amp;ldquo;You going to stand there all day? I don&amp;rsquo;t have time for this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sprite World is, at a most basic level, instructions on how to create an 8-bit inspired adventure using the Paragon system. The 37 page setting gives you character types, modified combat rules and scenario suggestions to create an 8-bit world all your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To use this book, players also need the Paragon Basic Rules and Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
