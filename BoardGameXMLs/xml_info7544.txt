							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Americana Golf Game</name>
									
			<description>This appears to be a simple dice game produced to be handed out on an airline (Americana?).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The centerpiece of the game is a tote board that cross references dice rolls with club selections. Players may choose from one of six golf courses identified in the accompanying brochure: Concord, Greenbrier, Torrey Pines, Canyon Country Club, Indian Wells, and La Costa. Each course is listed along with the yards to each hole and the par.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each roll of the dice counts as a stroke and all shots are recorded on the included score sheet. Rolling doubles allows a player to roll again, possibly holing the shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box bottom has a felt liner to allow players to quietly roll dice on those long airplane trips to the links!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
