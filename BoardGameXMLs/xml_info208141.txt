			<description>A Hideous Plot in Which Murder is Just the Start&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eureka! takes place in the city of Nuln in the Empire, although it could easily be any other Old World city. It is designed for 3-6 first-career player characters (PCs), and makes an excellent introductory adventure (or convention scenario) as it can easily be completed in a single session. It can also be added to an existing campaign as a fun aside, for even though Eureka! is intended for adventurers on their first career, it can still provide an interesting challenge to veteran groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario first appeared in White Dwarf (Issue 93 - Sep 1987), and was later reprinted, with some changes, in The Restless Dead. This version of the scenario, updated for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (2nd Edition), retains the original setting of the White Dwarf article.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
