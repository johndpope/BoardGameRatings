			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was cancelled in development. Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was considered to be a spiritual successor to P.T., the playable teaser for the cancelled video game Silent Hills. Before being funded by Team17, the game's development was fan-based. On 4 June 2016, the Allison Road Twitter account announced the game's cancellation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay of Allison Road is similar to that of P.T., presenting a minimal storyline which the player must solve. While not wanting to reveal too much of the actual game, developers stated the full version may be slightly different. According to the development team, &amp;quot;pretty much all of our core mechanics are in place, however, some actually didn't make the cut-off for the video; the inventory is one of those things.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Allison Road (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
