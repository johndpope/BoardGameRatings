			<description>In Ghost Hunter: Vampires players become Infernal Club investigators. In their latest adventure they have uncovered the worldwide phenomenon of vampirism. Now they risk their necks (literally) to become the best vampire hunters and end the curse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghost Hunter: Vampires is a card game for 2-6 players that should last for 10 &amp;ndash; 20 minutes. Players take turns to lay higher and higher cards on a central stack. If a player can&amp;rsquo;t lay an equal or higher card on a stack then they must pick up the stack. If a player lays a set or run of 3 cards at once then they get to capture the stack. Many of the cards that can be laid have addition rules that affect the game, for instance'the next player misses ago' or 'capture the top 3 cards from an opponent's capture pile, it is using these special rules at the right time that is the real skill of the game. The first player to play all of their cards ends the game. Players count up the scores of all of the cards they have captured minus all of the cards they didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to get rid of. The player with the highest score wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although Ghost Hunter: Vampires is a stand alone game, it is compatible with other Ghost Hunter decks, allowing players to combine decks or just play with their favorite cards from any deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
