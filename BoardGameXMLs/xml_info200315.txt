			<description>Winner, Best Incorporation of Perspective of Unheard or Marginalized People or Groups, 2015 Golden Cobra Challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Golden Cobra website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1952 London, the tearoom trade blossoms. The Countess Dillymore reminds us that we may have &amp;ldquo;forgotten that these particular queer men existed,&amp;rdquo; and perhaps we have. Countess Dillymore&amp;rsquo;s Too Much Slap on the Ecaf is an intimate larp about homosexual men hooking up in 1950s rural England. We saw this game and were immediately hooked by its solid intensity. But what sold us on it for this particular award was the tender and highly subjective portrayal of closeted queer men. Written as a letter from Dillymore to an anonymous audience, the game itself takes the induction into the social life of queerness quite seriously. Each player sets up three scenes. Then the players show intimacy through their characters along negotiated physical boundaries. We see so few games these days with such an earnest, no-nonsense portrayal of the world before Stonewall and Pride&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
