			<description>Players select one word, out of the 750 available, with the idea that none of the other players will know its meaning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lead player scores points by being skillful in his choice of words.  The other players score points by either determining the correct meaning of the word, or by &amp;quot;inventing&amp;quot; a definition which is so believable that if is accepted by one or more of the other players as being the correct one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may also take advantage of the &amp;quot;memory&amp;quot; round. in which they can score high points by remembering the words played in the two previous rounds of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
