							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Keep on Mountain Pass</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Huge and impressive, this fortress rises between two massive mountains. The fortress features 13 known levels, two of which are&lt;br/&gt;below the surface level. The level &amp;ldquo;0&amp;rdquo; has two gates with guardhouses, a road passes through the fortress. The subterranean levels&lt;br/&gt;are the dungeons, complete with torture chamber and cells. The levels from 1 to 10 feature barracks for soldiers and officer&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br/&gt;rooms. The higher level houses the lords of the keep and their families. Some hints to use the keep follow:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A legendary stronghold guarding a mountain pass, occupied by a strong garrison of the royal army.&lt;br/&gt;    A goblin infested ruined keep; the goblins attack any caravan passing through the ancient walls.&lt;br/&gt;    An ancient keep now haunted by spectres and undeads, a lich is said to live under the dome on the upper level.&lt;br/&gt;    An ex-fortress, now useless, because the nations live in peace, and therefore transformed in a huge marketplace.&lt;br/&gt;    A ruined keep, now hideout of a famed bandit who assaults nearby territories&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
