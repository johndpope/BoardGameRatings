			<description>Can you tell a good story?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the board game Story, you and your opponents match pictures, explain why they belong together and then vote for the player who told the best story. The reason why your picture is the best match is up to you. No explanation is more correct than another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each round, the players show who they have voted for and points are given accordingly. The player who receives the most votes is awarded 1 point. Every player who has voted for that player&amp;rsquo;s story receives 3 points. Each player receives between 0 and 4 points each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player that first reaches 20 points or more wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
