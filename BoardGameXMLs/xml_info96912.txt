							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Resort World</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working on their own islands, players of Resort World are given a plot of land and an old neglected pier and tasked to build from these humble beginnings and create a holiday resort / amusement park for tourists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resort World is a slow casual online game. Building constructions takes hours, and there are hours between revenue returns from the buildings, allowing the player to play the game as a casual pastime, not an intensive play at the computer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can invite 'neighbors' who work on their resorts independently, but alongside the player. Players can visit their neighbor's islands, perform small tasks there, contribute to some projects, and gift items, but actual interaction at the management level is limited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
