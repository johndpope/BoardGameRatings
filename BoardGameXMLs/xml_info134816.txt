			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;StarForge is a game about resource-gathering and surviving on an alien planet. Earth is dying. You build bases and craft items in order to sustain a population on a new planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are elements of RTS, FPS, RPG, Voxel Builder, Tower Defense, and Physics Sandbox genres. Players can live out their own adventure on the new planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Controversy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On January 27th, 2017, The unfinished StarForge was made free to download on its official website and removed from sale on Steam. Many who paid for the game through Steam or the game's cowdfunder were left feeling cheated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
