			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While you were away, things did not go according to plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Someone ran up a whole bunch of debts in your name. Someone made a lot of promises and commitments on your behalf. Someone even signed you up for some sort of inn time-sharing scheme. Someone was not very nice; not nice at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But they looked like you, sounded like you and got you into more than a lot of trouble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps you'll show them the meaning of the word trouble, once you find them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nothing To See Here is a mid-level, somewhat humorous fantasy adventure for parties of three or more with moderate equipment (some magical items). It is written using a generic statistic system that makes it readily convertible to almost any role-playing system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
