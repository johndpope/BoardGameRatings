			<description>&amp;quot;Abstract Game for 2 Players. Tac-tac-toe variant with a regular deck of cards and played on 3 Boards.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Each board is a 3 x 3 grid. Each space (square) on each board is numbered. The Spaces on a board are numbered 1 through 9. Each player gets 1 Home Board. The third board which is placed between the players is called the Mid Board.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card play allows you to transfer one of your pieces to another board or to switch your piece's position for that of another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;To achieve victory, you must get two simultaneous three-in-a- rows (TIARS). TIARS cannot be on your Home Board. You could have both TIARS on your opponents board or the Mid board, or 1 TIAR each on the Mid board and your opponent&amp;rsquo;s board. If both TIARS are on the same board, they may share a space.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
