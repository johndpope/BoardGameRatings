			<description>Good Little Martian is a cooperative survival game for 2 players (although it can also be played solo), aged 12+ that takes about 30 minutes. It is available as a free print-and-play download from the Good Little Games website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game strands one player on Mars while the other player must take the reins at Mission Control back on Earth. The aim of the game is to keep the Martian player alive while the rescue ship travels from Earth. If the Martian loses all of their Food, Energy or Shelter before the ship lands, the mission is a failure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses 27 cards, plus 5 small tokens and a regular six-sided dice. Each player has a different deck of 12 multi-use cards; the other three cards track the Martian&amp;rsquo;s crucial resources and the ship&amp;rsquo;s progress to Mars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Martian&amp;rsquo;s resources are dwindling; their equipment unpredictable and malfunctioning. Mission Control can send instructions to help, but must also devote enough effort to keep the rescue ship on course and on time. Solar storms are a constant threat and the clock is ticking! Will the Martian survive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
