			<description>&amp;quot;Two rival space outpost's try to knock over the opponent's space fleet, but there is a new angle!  Missiles must rebound off of back or sides of game board to hit targets.  Play area measures 15 3/4 x 13 1/4 x 2 1/2 inches high.  Plastic.  Imported.  For 2 Players. ... For ages 5 years to Adult&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the Sears Christmas Catalog 1983, page 585&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes turns firing spring loaded cannon at the other player's ships.  A BB would arc across the tilted play area and land on the opponent's side, hopefully hitting their ship.  If hit, the ship would flip over revealing an explosion sticker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the official rules encouraged alternating one shot at a time, shots could be fired rapidly, with only your BB supply the limiting factor.  As your opponent also fired it would replenish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to Epoch's 1974 Torpedo game, but with a self recycling ball mechanism that removes the fuss and set up of that game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
