			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kaalu is an abstract strategy game about balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 63 stones -- 21 in each of two player colors (referred to as black and white), and a third neutral color.  At the start of the game, seven piles are placed on the surface, each consisting of three neutral stones, and two of each player colors, for a total of seven stones in each pile, with each player maintaining the remaining seven stones in their color in front of them to form their stock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play consists of players taking alternating turns starting with black.  Each move is either the placement of a stone from their stock into a pile on the board, or moving any number of neutral stones and/or stones of their color from one pile to another, in order to create a number piles with 'primacy' in their player color.  There are a few small restrictions on moves that can be used by cunning players to strategically limit their opponent's viable options.  The first player to reach the target number of piles with primacy in their color wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
