							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Soap Time</name>
									
			<description>Soap Time describes itself as &amp;quot;the soapy situation board game for adult couples.&amp;quot; It may be played by 2, 4 or 6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to amass 2500 points by hoping for the best result in various &amp;quot;soapy situations&amp;quot;, or by arguing one's point sufficiently well to gain additional points (or keep from losing points) awarded by a &amp;quot;soapy situation&amp;quot; card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a partner who may bask in the reflected glory of a particular &amp;quot;soapy&amp;quot; outcome, gain at the expense of a partner's humiliation, suffer losses due to a partner's triumph, or experience no effect at all. However, victory in this game is an individual rather than a team accomplishment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players who fall sufficiently into the hole point wise may elect to have their token commit suicide and start over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game cards reflect the rationale for the game's name, with the &amp;quot;soapy situations&amp;quot; being of the type most likely to be found in a soap opera, if anywhere. However, there is no explicit tie-in to any particular show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
