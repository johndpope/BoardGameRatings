							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Albedo (2nd Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        The Albedo Role-playing Game is based upon &amp;quot;Erma Felna, EDF&amp;quot;, the feature story in the comic book Albedo, Anthropomorphics. It is a dramatic &amp;quot;hard science&amp;quot; science fiction tale with an unusual twist of characters that are funny animals. The anthropomorphic character races are portrayed as races in their own right, rather than simply being people dressed in furry animal suits.&lt;br/&gt;        Albedo aims to be very different from run-of-the-mill science fiction adventure games. Although it can be played as a standard shoot'em up, it contains easily usable rules for simulating character personalities, love, hate, loyalty, and treachery. Clever adventure plots, political intrigue, and interpersonal relations become readily playable, encouraging a very different type of game.&lt;br/&gt;        Albedo's background material is notable for its well thought out technological base and the unique society it describes. The game includes details on languages and alphabet, societal attitudes, and day-to-day life, as well as outlining dozens of different critter races. The abundant illustrations by Steve Gallacci, writer of the Albedo, Anthropomorphics comics, give the reader a clear view of the univers of &amp;quot;Erma Felna, EDF.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;        You can play a member of the elite Extraplanetary Defense Force, fighting insurgent agents inside of the Independent Lapine Republic as they sow the seeds of revolt. Be a member of a local Homeguard, defending your planet from terrorist attacks. Or play a civilian caught up in the strife of a galaxy at war. All of this is possible in Albedo!&lt;br/&gt;        Dice needed to play: 2d6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;Second edition is the same mechanics as 1st edition, with errata applied, a few minor changes, and a new layout. It still uses the same 2d6 based engine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
