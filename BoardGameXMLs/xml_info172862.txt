			<description>Welcome to Dazzling Zoo! In our zoo, we only have 5 different animals. Just don't turn round and leave! Our animals are not as usual. Come in and try to figure out their face, color and living place. Only the visitor who has clearest mind will successfully recognize the right animal. So, feel free to explore this dazzling zoo and look how colorful our zoo is, and make sure that you won't feel dizzy after visiting our zoo. Have fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dazzling Zoo is a game that need players to recognize different conditions the next card shows on its back. There are 3 conditions on each card's back, which is 'animal', 'animal's color', and 'living place'. Once the zoo face shows up, player need to figure out the right answer and touch the right tile as soon as possible. However, players should also beware of trapping situation, that if the zoo face is exactly the same as the answering tile, the right tile immediately becomes the wrong tile. Therefore, it is not a game for the quickest player, but for the player with cautiousness as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
