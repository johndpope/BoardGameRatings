							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Gate: A Game of Myth and Magic</name>
									
			<description>The Gate is a role-playing board game that incorporates a wide range of natural, mythological, and symbolic elements. The game board has a unique, abstract style: images of keys, suns, and moons are set alongside pictures of dragons and other fantastical monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gate is essentially a race to the center of the board. Players compete with each other as they advance through three levels of spaces arranged in concentric rings. The first player to the Gate wins. At the start of the game, each player chooses an identity from five different player types: Creature, Dwarf, Elf, Sorcerer, and Warrior. Players roll dice and play cards as they move clockwise around the board. In order to advance to a higher level, one must circle the level, acquire a key card, and defeat a monster. Throughout the game, players encounter a variety of enemies and use fighting dice and weapon cards to combat them. Players also battle each other using dice and cards. The advanced game employs additional cards as well as special fighting and moving dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game box includes both the beginner and advanced versions. It contains one 28&amp;quot; x 24&amp;quot; game board, 333 cards (beginner and advanced decks), 8 metal pieces, 10 custom dice (beginner and advanced), 82 glass pebbles (used as currency), several rule cards, and a &amp;quot;scroll&amp;quot; card with the story of The Gate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
