							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MX vs. ATV: Untamed</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MX vs. ATV: Untamed is the seventh title in Rainbow Studios MX vs. ATV series. Players race a wild assortment of off-road vehicles across a number of different tracks. The title integrates many elements from previous games in the series, along with a few new features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vehicles available for use include monster trucks, ATVs, motorbikes, dune buggies, and trophy trucks. There are six different racing series to choose from, as well as the X-Cross, which combines them into a single championship. Most of the series are race-style modes, but freestyle mode has events centered on performing tricks for points. Endurocross and Opencross are the new events to the series. Endurocross is a race across a Supercross track littered with obstacles such as ponds and trees, while Opencross is an outdoor race event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The control scheme for the game has an arcade feel, with riders being able to perform large jumps and turn tight corners easily. Untamed includes a 12 player online multiplayer and a number of mini-games to compete in beyond the standard race events. The minigames include ATV Hockey, Monster Smash, section Racing, Snake, Graffiti, and Tag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
