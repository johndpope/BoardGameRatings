			<description>The word finder is designed with one thing in mind: scoring big points. The method is simple-present as many playable words as possible, in one place, for easy reference during the game. High-scoring words are arranged alphabetically by first letter and by inside letters, proving the widest array of possible word variations. Standard suggestions are listed in regular tpye, high-scoring words (worth 10 to 14 points) are listed in bold face, and extra high-scoring words (worth 15 points or more) are marked with an asterisk. Additional tips and resources are provided within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
