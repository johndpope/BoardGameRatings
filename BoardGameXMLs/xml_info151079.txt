			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this interesting, old-school style, turn-based RPG you control four characters: Tristam, Kaeli, Phoebe and Reuben. They all start in a town and have predetermined stats which can be upgraded as they gain levels. Also, all characters have mana points and can cast various spells. Your goal is to lead them through Evil Cave in search for the Evil Witch. You gain various items such as potions as well as weapons and gold after killing monsters. When returning to town, you can visit the Shop where you can buy new items, improve your items or sell unwanted ones. Visiting the Inn will rest your characters and replenish their health and mana points. Finally, visiting the tavern gives you the opportunity to accept new quests and gain money and powerful items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
