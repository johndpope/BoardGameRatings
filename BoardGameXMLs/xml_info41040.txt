			<description>Darkball, a &amp;quot;truly monstrous game!&amp;quot; it's a collectible soccer-like game. Each player creates his team choosing the players from his collection of monsters. Each monster has a point value and some special ability and it's printed on pog-like disks. The players use a sort of plastic hand to shoot the Darkball, a glowing ball similar to tiddlywinks.&lt;br/&gt;There are 10 races to choose from and each one has its own champions and peculiarities. You can choose from Human Gladiators, Skeletrids, Reptyl Race, Walkir Viragoes, Zombics, Felinian Players, Canidians Pro, Droids Forever, Orchetto's people, Aracnyans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
