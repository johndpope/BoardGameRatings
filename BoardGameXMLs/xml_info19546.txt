							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Share Game</name>
									
			<description>The object of the game is to win as much as possible by buying and selling shares. &lt;br/&gt;Brief description: Players are each given oil shares, industrial shares, mining shares and money - 1000 of each. &lt;br/&gt;The first player takes a telegram from the top of pile and reads it to himself and places it face down on the table in front of him. he then throws the two dice at the same time and moves the correct share marker to a higher or lower price and follows any printed instructions there.&lt;br/&gt;He may use his telegram at this point or hold to a later point in the game. To present it he turns it face upwards and the share marker to which it applies is then moved to a higher or lower price as indicated by telegram.&lt;br/&gt;Shares may then be bought or sold by any player at the value indicated. &lt;br/&gt;Then once players have bought or sold play continues by the next player picking up a telegram.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the last telegram is taken from the pack, the dice are thrown for the last time. Each player is then, in turn given one chance to present any telegrams still held.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: One die is chosen as the number 1 die. This die determines which share type rises or falls, according to the table printed on the board and box. The other die shows the amount of fluctuation. For example if number 1 die shows 3 and number 2 die shows 6 the price of mining shares will fall 6 points. &lt;br/&gt;Table as below:&lt;br/&gt;No 1 dice&lt;br/&gt;1. Industrials fall&lt;br/&gt;2. Oils fall&lt;br/&gt;3. Mining falls&lt;br/&gt;4 Industrial rise&lt;br/&gt;5. Oils rise&lt;br/&gt;6. Mining Rises&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
