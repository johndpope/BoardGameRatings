			<description>Red Seven is an interesting mix between Scrabble and Bridge: tiles show a letter (with its value, as in Scrabble) and the symbol of a poker card suit. As in Bridge, we find two partnerships against each other: in the auction, the partners should propose a contract, i.e. a suit and a number of &amp;quot;tricks&amp;quot; they plan to take. The &amp;quot;trick&amp;quot;, in effect, is made by confrontation between the value of the word you place on the board (as in Scrabble) and the one of the previous player: so, any word is considered in 2 &amp;quot;tricks&amp;quot; (the one with the previous and the one with the following player). The suit proposed by the winner of the auction is the &amp;quot;trump&amp;quot; for the round: once played, the tiles with this suit on will receive a bonus in points. &lt;br/&gt;The game is played in 3 rounds: any player receive a random set of tiles per round. At the end of any round, the teams score victory points according to the contract made at the beginning of the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
