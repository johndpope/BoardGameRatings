			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Progenitor is an imponderably alien entity from unformed antiquity. It is a creature that cannot, or perhaps should not, remain in a fully-formed universe. A Progenitor is older than the world, older than the universe - perhaps older than time itself.&lt;br/&gt;The most familiar, yet in some ways the most disturbing, appear to be the template or ideal for an entire order of material life. Others are imponderably alien, the prototypes of failed realities and unrealized sentiences. Regardless of type, a Progenitor is incredibly dangerous. Its powers are both immense and difficult for mundane energies to combat, and its nature and intentions are almost always destructive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some scientists theorize that Progenitors' destructive nature stems from a sort of cosmic competition, that the existing reality is the get of a single Progenitor and all others would stop at nothing to annihilate and replace it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a given Progenitor were not the only one of its own kind, it might be capable of communication, but the very nature of all other existing life forms is antithetical to it, and it never speaks or expresses itself in any way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
