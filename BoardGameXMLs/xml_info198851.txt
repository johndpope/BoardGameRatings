							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Infinite Wall</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town of Cling grips a wall that stretches infinitely in every direction. There are five thousand Clingers, perhaps a little smaller, perhaps a little thinner, perhaps a little dimmer than you would know; but human nonetheless. Haze and cloud protect the Clingers from a view of the infinite and an unabashed lack of imagination protects them from considering it. Well, until recently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You cannot avoid it any longer, Clingers need answers. For countless generations, they have been avoiding it but there must be change. You and your secret society are going to help them change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As uncommonly brave and adventurous Clingers, you will eventually leave the precarious boundaries of Cling to explore and return. Why you leave and what you say on your return depends on your loyalty. But leaving isn&amp;rsquo;t that easy when resources are tight and the vast majority of people don&amp;rsquo;t see why you would ever want to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
