			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Synergy (sɪnədʒi): the interaction or cooperation of two or more substances to produce a combined effect greater than the sum of their separate effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sigil Synergy is not a mod for the Sigil System.  Instead, it is a meta-mod that shows you how to combine the various mods available for the Sigil System and use them effectively in your games. Every mod in the Sigil System range is meant to work with one another, so that you can use as many (or as few) mods in your games as you want, and they will all seamlessly fit together. Sigil Synergy is here to show you just how you can do that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sigil Synergy will forever be a WIP document, as the list of Sigil Mods will always continue to grow. As we create more mods, we will come back and update Sigil Synergy with more characters and factions and what-not so that you can see how these new mods work with the old ones and with each other. The more mods we get, the bigger Sigil Synergy will get and the more complex its characters and factions, and through this you will be able to trace how to make the simplest of characters with the fewest mods to the most complex ones with all the mods available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basis for Sigil Synergy will be its characters, as character options are the key feature in most mods. Alongside premade character sheets for each character, there will also be a bit of lore and history for the character so that if you want to use them in your games, you will get a feel for what they are like. The character lore needs a basis to feel real, and for that we have chosen the Final War setting, a WIP setting that we are making on World Anvil that you can explore and see the updates for as they regularly come in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since Sigil Synergy deals with all the other mods for the Sigil System, you will need the Sigil System in order to use it. It is also setting-neutral so you can use it for any setting or genre that you can think of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside the mod:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    An ever expanding list of characters, factions and everything else the Sigil Mods can offer&lt;br/&gt;    Detailed explanations for how to use the various Sigil Mods together&lt;br/&gt;    Lore and history for each entity in the book based off the Final War project on World Anvil.&lt;br/&gt;    Pre-made character sheets to use in game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
