			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the year 2975, T.A. A millenia since the witch-king waged war on the realms of Arnor, in a series of battles of which their was ultimately no victor. Men have forgotten this time, but the witch-king has not. At his masters behest he is to test the resolve of the occupants of the Northern Realms to see what remains of their ancient lineage, and strive to lessen what aid they could possibly send to the Southern kingdom of Gondor, come the eruption of the next war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
