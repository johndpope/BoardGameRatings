			<description>Le fleau des dieux is based on a French comics translated in English in 2008 by Marvel (&amp;quot;Scourge of the Gods&amp;quot;).  The theme of this game is a mix of both Space conquest and a the ancient Roman empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game sets the players into conflict for the control of the galaxy. The victory is achieved if a player control a chain of five planets or seven in total (without the chain condition). The first phase consist of dividing the planets among all players, then you will fight to gain more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of his turn player should choose one of his planet, other player can do the same to participate in the fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combat system is based on two type of cards :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    units (with attack values depending on the field)&lt;br/&gt;    special cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner will choose two planets participating to the fight and then each other player will choose one (except the last who will get nothing).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
