			<description>Fat Princess Adventures is an Action-RPG video game developed by Fun Bits Interactive and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for PlayStation 4. It was released in North America and Europe on December 5, 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fat Princess Adventures has received mixed reviews from critics, scoring 66/100 on Metacritic, and 66.67% on GameRankings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mark Steighner of Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 4 out of 5 saying, &amp;quot;Fat Princess was subversive, politically incorrect and unexpectedly complex in its strategy and depth. Fat Princess Adventures trades a little of that depth for a more straightforward, action RPG-focused design.&amp;quot; Chris Carter from Destructoid rated the game a 7/10 saying, &amp;quot;Fat Princess Adventures is an enjoyable distraction for hardcore fans of the hack-and-slash genre, but now I just want a proper new Princess game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Fat Princess Adventures&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
