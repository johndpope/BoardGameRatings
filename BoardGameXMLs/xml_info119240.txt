			<description>Miniature Rules for World War Two Naval Warfare&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scale:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;tactical turn = 10 minutes&lt;br/&gt;strategic turns = 40 minutes&lt;br/&gt;4 cm = one nautical mile &lt;br/&gt;1 model = one ship or four or five aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player's take the role of squadron or fleet commander.  One die per battery.  If a hit is scored, another die is rolled to determine the damage. AA fire is handled a bit differently with each ship having a number of Light AA, and AA dice dependent upon armament. Within certain restrictions these dice may be allocated to more than one enemy flight per turn as required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Radar can be useful to detect enemy forces. Once forces come within visual range, firing is likely to commence.  Damage rates may seem high. It is quite possible for a destroyer to be sunk in a single round of combat. Ships suffer damage which includes degradation of firepower, speed, or C3 systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C3 systems and formation command are simulated with each formation's flagship maneuvering and any ships in formation with it will conform. Ships not in the flagship&amp;rsquo;s formation roll a die to determine whether they may maneuver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ref: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://mcmdgames.blogspot.com/2012/01/ww2-all-at-sea&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://mcmdgames.blogspot.com/2012/01/ww2-all-at-sea&lt;/a&gt; review.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
