			<description>The first player takes as many tiles he thinks he can remember and forms face-down tile-row on the table.&lt;br/&gt;The next player can either add a tile to the row to be the first player or place it behind the row. All players do the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who leads the row must state the colors of the tiles one by one. If successful, it gets rid of his generous balls of wool by distributing to each opponent. If he's not successful, the other shepherds give him a free ball of wool. And it was the turn of the second player  on the row to state the colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get rid of his balls of wool wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
