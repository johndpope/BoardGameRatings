							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Seven Sisters</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beautiful, powerful, mysterious, and deadly - the silver-haired Seven Sisters are legendary throughout the Forgotten Realms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One rules the city of bards, Silverymoon. Another is Elminster's beloved and the infamous Witch-Queen of Aglarond. The third is the Lady Mage of Waterdeep, peer and consort of Kelben &amp;quot;Blackstaff&amp;quot; Arunsun, and the fourth is a Harper and one of the famous Knights of Myth Drannor. The fifth is a leader of the Harpers and a legendary bard in her own right, and the sixth is a dead - perhaps undead - witch. And the seventh? She's the on who wild tales are whispered about all across Faerun around many a fireside late at night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But who are they, really? Their very names conjure up romance, allure, and power - Storm Silverhand, the Simbol, High Lady Alustriel. Sages say they are among the Chosen of Mystra, archmages who wield magic few can dare to stand against. Yet these seven do not seek to rule the world, and they often stay quiet and hidden for generations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That hints at another thing. These seven seem immortal, never aging as the long years pass. Just who are these Seven Sisters, and what are their secrets?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Read this tome, and learn what the Zhentarim, the Red Wizards of Thay, and the Cult of the Dragon could not, despite performing many fell deeds in the attempt. Learn the stories of these great ladies, and their aims and strivings - and browse among over a hundred new and spectacular spells! Dungeon Masters and players alike will find this volume an essential sourcebook of Realmslore, and a handy guide to archsorceresses peerless in power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
