			<description>A resource gathering game where you are paying off the various noble houses of Dayrm to become the successor of the dead regent to the city of Farsley.  You will move your agents to each of the different merchants to gather the fine goods that these noble families desire in order to back your claim to become the next regent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The modular board allows each game to be unique.  Each of the different payoffs can be played randomly under each of the 7 noble houses.  The order of the merchants is never the same as they populate around and create the game board.  Be the first to gather all the required items and become the next regent of Farsley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
