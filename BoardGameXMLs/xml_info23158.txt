			<description>The date - November 27, 1969; the place - The Groovy A Go~Go, Peace A Go~GoGreenwich Village, NYC; the victim Ruby Tuesday,  the star reporter for the underground newspaper, &amp;quot;The Times They Be A Changin!&amp;quot; Get ready to venture back in time to the psychedelic sixties and into the world of bell bottoms, love beads and  headbands. Be prepared to party with the &amp;quot;in crowd&amp;quot;, to &amp;quot;trip&amp;quot; back to the past, to &amp;quot;protest&amp;quot; with the best and help solve the Ruby's murder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was a busy time for Ruby....the moon walk, the war, the many protests, marches, sit-ins and love-ins. The times, they  really were &amp;quot;a changin&amp;quot;and they kept Ruby hoping as she scampered about the city scooping the hottest stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what happened? Ruby had been invited to meet a group of friends for a quick bite at the coolest club in town, a new  hot spot, the Groovy A Go~Go. What Ruby didn't know was that it was to be a surprise birthday party for our star reporter! Balloons and streamers filled the room...the Beatle boots were bopping to the latest hits and everyone was ready for a far-out happening...everybody but Ruby...for as it seems, the chick never showed. Alas her poor lifeless body was found in the dumpster behind the club. It was tightly wrapped in a tie dyed sheet and a scribbled note was found taped to the dumpster. It read simply, &amp;quot;Goodbye Ruby Tuesday&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So come join this happening crowd - Buzz Bullet (straight laced, clean-shaven, dedicated member of the ROTC), the Maharishi (wise and gentle, all knowing and kind...hmmmm), Maryjane Cannabiski (makes the best brownies in town), Trippie Dickie Nickson (he is not a crook), Roger the Dodger (hell no, he won't go) and lots of other groovy chicks and dudes...and now it's time to get ready for peace and love....and MURDER!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
