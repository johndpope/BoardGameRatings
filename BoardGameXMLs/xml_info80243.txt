			<description>Published in 1992, the original Super Sidekicks (known as Tokuten Ou, &amp;quot;Goal-Scoring King&amp;quot; in Japan) was SNK's first soccer video game. It features 12 teams divided into two groups which compete for the &amp;quot;SNK Cup&amp;quot; (the main differences between teams is their formations on the field):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Group A: Germany, Italy, Spain, England, Mexico, Japan&lt;br/&gt;    Group B: Argentina, Holland, Brazil, France, United States, South Korea&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your team plays against all the others in your group, then it goes into an elimination tournament's semifinals and then the final to win the cup. There was also a hidden feature in the game, which wasn't documented, and affects a single player game. During a free kick for the CPU if the player has tapped button A for player two, the cpu performed a short-shot, while pressing the button A performed a longer kick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One noted mistake was that Spain's kit would actually resemble Portugal's. Portugal would not be in the game until Super Sidekicks 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super Sidekicks&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
