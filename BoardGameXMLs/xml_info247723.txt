			<description>Choose from a variety of powerful Battle Bosses to summon minions, utilize devastating abilities, and obliterate your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle Boss takes you away from the classic unsung hero adventure and lets you go head to head as the &amp;quot;end boss&amp;quot; in this epic gladiator arena battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle Boss is a 2-6 player game that has you playing 1 of 6 Epic Bosses, utilizing dice to gain Energy and Crystal resources to unleash devastating moves, spawn Minions to send to battle, while playing cards to gain tactical advantage specific for your Boss and Minions. Be the last Boss standing while loyal minions are just collateral damage!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each game, both player combine and set up their tiles to create a single battlefield, put their boss in the starting space, and draws 5 cards from their deck. On their turn, each player rolls 4 dice which will give them energy and crystals. Energy must be spent the turn it is earned to use the boss&amp;rsquo;s abilities such as movement, creating minions, and their ultimate move, while crystals can be saved up to play cards. At the end of each player&amp;rsquo;s turn, they draw back up to 5 cards. Cards include upgrade cards, which stick around to give your boss or minions more powerful abilities, and single-use effect cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As minions and bosses move around the battlefield, they will fight enemies in their space. Minions in a space with an enemy minion will destroy each other, and bosses in spaces with enemy minions or bosses will take damage. Bosses will get knocked out if they take enough damage, and the last boss standing wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SOLO MODE:&lt;br/&gt;Although the heart of Battle Boss are head-to-head battles, each Battle Boss comes with a short campaign where you can play as the minions as they try to usurp their Boss. Campaign plays differently per boss and offer a unique experience no matter which Battle Boss is your favorite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
