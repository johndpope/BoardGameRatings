							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">League Leader Hurling Boardgame</name>
									
			<description>This boardgame depicts all the aspects of the Gaelic sport of hurling including rules, terminology and tactics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players play their games against the board. A single game is played by traveling the perimeter of the board from the throw in square to the final whistle square. Goals and points are scored during each game by landing on certain squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each circuit of the board results in a score which players record on a league table.  Each player has their own league table for recording results.  When each player's league table has been completed, the player with the most league points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(edited from official description)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
