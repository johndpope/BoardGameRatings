			<description>Activity Code Word is played in teams, with each team needing to guess a secret code word decided on by the team sitting on their right. For each successfully described word, they are allowed to ask a letter in their code word. The team who first guesses their code word wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The words that have to be described are printed on 110 cards, with six words per card, two for each of these three categories: verbal description, drawing and pantomime. One group member explains, draws or pantomimes (which of these is decided by a die); the other members of the group have to guess the word. If they manage to guess correctly before the time is up, they are allowed to ask if the first letter of the word they successfully described and guessed features in their secret code word. If the answer is yes, they write down the letter. If the answer is no, the team crosses out that letter. Then it is the next team's turn. At the start of each of their turns, if one team thinks they know their code word, they may name their solution. If it is correct, they win; if not, the game continues as usual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
