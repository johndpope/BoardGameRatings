			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the Psionics Augmented: Occult project, Dreamscarred Press is working to integrate psychic magic from Pathfinder RPG: Occult Adventures into the psionics system from Ultimate Psionics and related products. Within the pages of these releases you'll find new feats, archetypes, items, and more, bringing psionic takes on psychic classes, psychic takes on psionic classes, and everything in-between. With Psionics Augmented: Empath, the psionic take of the medium class is presented with the empath archetype.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The empath is a psionic manifester sensitive to the echoes of history. They can communicate with the personifications of awe-inspiring events, the zeitgeists, and bargain for their power. The empath's contracts with the zeitgeists let her take on their associated powers&amp;mdash;and compulsions and goals&amp;mdash;that she can mix and match every day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want to play a character who can reach out and connect with the world around them, tug on the heartstrings of all the world, and choose exactly which histories your foes are doomed to repeat, the empath is for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the pages of this product, you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The empath, an archetype for the medium class from Pathfinder RPG: Occult Adventures.&lt;br/&gt;    25 Zeitgeists for your empath to use, from the Cogito lesser zeitgeist, to the Vinum Verum supreme zeitgeist.&lt;br/&gt;    Variant rules including options for transparency, rune magic, and integration with the Pathfinder RPG: Ultimate Intrigue zeitgeist binder archetype&lt;br/&gt;    Rules for how the empath works with the collective&lt;br/&gt;    And new psionic powers for the empath&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
