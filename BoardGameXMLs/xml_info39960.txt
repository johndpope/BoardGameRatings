			<description>This is not so much of a game as a device for simulating a tennis match. The board holds a score board and four rotating randomizers. The server rotates her handle to first serve and back to the start, revealing a type of shot (Drop shot, ace, forehand, etc). The receiver rotates his handle to the type of ball served, and back again, revealing a player a return stroke (winner, lob, volley, out, etc). If the receiver hits a return shot the server replies using &amp;quot;general play dial&amp;quot; and so on till some-one gets a &amp;quot;winner&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;out&amp;quot; result. If you know the rules of tennis, it's obvious how to simulate a match given these rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
