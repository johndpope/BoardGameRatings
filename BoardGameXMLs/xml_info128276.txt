							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Was ist  Was: Junior â€“ Polizei Kartenspiel</name>
									
			<description>A card game that teaches children about some typical tasks police officers have to do and what equipment they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: 16 challenge boards, 53 cards, rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether the finale of an important soccer tournament or a state visit is taking place, whether there is a case of suspected arson or a suspicious suitcase is found - the police has to face many different challenges. What is to be done in each case and what means are needed is described on the challenge boards. The cards also show different resources that help the police to complete these tasks, such as handcuffs, a walkie-talkie, a police dog, a police horse, helicopter, motorbike etc. Players try to collect all the necessary resources for one of the three current challenges. If they are successful, they earn that challenge card and the points written on the card. The game ends when one player has collected 10 points or when the last card has been drawn. The player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
