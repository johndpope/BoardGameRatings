			<description>What would you do if you found yourself trapped on an eerie space station with nothing but a computer? You play the hacker Alex and help your partner Sam uncover the horrible truth of the facility. Code 7 is a text-based hacking adventure that combines a fully-voiced narrative with immersive typing gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;Gather information, navigate and hack your way through the prologue of an epic, five-chapter adventure. It doesn't take long until you have to ask yourself who Alex really is and if your reality is really what it seems to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
