			<description>A color matching, tile laying game for young children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players place tiles with red, blue and yellow triangles.  Each side of a placed tile must match the tiles around it.  If an area of color is closed off (no longer has any sides where more tiles may be placed) the person who played the last card gets one point per card containing the color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is designed for small children.  It helps counting small numbers (2-5) when scoring areas, and up to 30 or 40 when tallying final score.  The decision set is small, but there are important decisions to be made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
