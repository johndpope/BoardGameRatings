			<description>SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;When a biological plague infects most of earth, distorting the newly discovered HELIX strand in our DNA, creating immediate mental defects and physical deterioration. The deformities mutate and the &amp;quot;age of zombies&amp;quot; becomes a reality. A desperate call for help from survivors gathered from around the world; through discovery of a secret United Nations project, awaken a reserve of space marines put in cryogenic suspension to return to earth with only one mission... to save the handful of survivors from becoming assimilated into zombies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME-PLAY:&lt;br/&gt;This is a two player game that generally lasts between 15-30 minutes. The box set comes with two 60 card decks; one for the Space Marines and one for the Zombies. The game offers Character Cards, Action Cards, Equipment Cards (for Space Marines Only), and Survivor Cards. Attacks are directly geared towards the characters and Survivors rather than the players. There is a follow-up expansion set ahead that can be a stand-alone or mixed in with this First Edition set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GOAL:&lt;br/&gt;To goal for the marines is to save 10 Civilians and help them leave earth safely with them whereas the goal of the zombies are simple.... feed. If the zombies &amp;quot;turn&amp;quot; all the civilians into zombies or kill off all the space marines, the zombies win. If the marines extract 10 civilians or kill off all the zombies, they win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
