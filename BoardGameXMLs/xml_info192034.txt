			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cosplay is a new team of heroic Base Raiders usable as pregenerated player characters, NPC allies, or rivals. Each member of Cosplay has plot hooks that could be used in your next Base Raiders games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Saber Antimony: A Japanese magical school girl who fought demonically possessed beings in Tokyo. She disappeared for a long time, only to resurface now. How did she escape Ragnarok? Why is she raiding bases? Is she the real Saber or an imposter? No one knows...yet!&lt;br/&gt;    Pretty Soldier: A talented Russian power armor pilot equipped with a unique suit of armor built with alien technology. Is she in control of the armor or is it?&lt;br/&gt;    The Chosen One: The little brother of a missing superhero takes up his cause. He has incredible telekinetic powers but also believes in his own hype too much. He literally believes he is the Hero with a Thousand Faces, which gets him into trouble quite often.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement also contains information on how to use Cosplay in your game and Saber Antimony's arch-nemsis, The Darkness That Dwells. An ancient evil returning to menace humanity, the Darkness that Dwells can possess humans or animals, turning them into savage monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
