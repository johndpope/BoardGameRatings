			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a time of adventure, of clashing swords and spells. It is an age ruled by the passions of the bold and the whims of the elder dragons. The world is full of hidden secrets and glittering treasures, of the legacies of the dragons, of allen empires, of the demon gods of ancient times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are mighty kingdoms, grand cities, and quaint villages, and wherever you came from, you are one of those rare people with the talent and power (or failing that, the bloody-minded determination) to leave your home to become an adventurer and seek your destiny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon World is a game for getting together with friends to make up stories about a bunch of passionate weirdoes running around getting into trouble in a bright, weird fantasy setting. It&amp;rsquo;s heavily inspired by 90s fantasy comedy anime and manga like Slayers and Dragon Half, though the rules are derived from D. Vincent Baker&amp;rsquo;s game Apocalypse World. Another way to think of it is it&amp;rsquo;s a game for playing just the really silly parts of a D&amp;amp;D campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play you&amp;rsquo;ll need some friends to play with (at least three people total), some six-sided dice (two per player), pencils, and paper. Printouts of the playbooks work best by far, but any paper will do in a pinch. One person is going to be the Dragon Master (or DM for short) and handle the overall game world, while the rest are players, who each have one character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon World Hack (Version 0.1)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking a cue from Dungeon World, this &amp;quot;Dragon World Hack&amp;quot; is a playable version of Dragon World, but requires the Apocalypse World rulebook (or at the very least a good knowledge of the game) in order to play. I&amp;rsquo;ll likely do a full stand-alone version with pictures and everything at some point, but for now I just want to share this fun thing I made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
