							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Road Rash: Jailbreak</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Road Rash: Jailbreak builds on earlier Road Rash titles by allowing the player to race courses while bashing other riders and trying to stay a step ahead of the law.  In this game, there are three different characters to choose from, all with different strengths and weaknesses.  The goal of the main mode in the game is to amass victories and gain power-ups such as special weapons to eventually become the leader of your gang and spring a friend out of jail.  There is another mode called &amp;quot;Five-O&amp;quot; where the player instead takes on the role of a police officer trying to bust as many biker punks as he can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
