			<description>This entry refers to the Nintendo DS Lite portable console.  As the console is not region locked, this pertains to all regions the console was sold in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nintendo DS Lite (ニンテンドーDS Lite?)  is a dual-screen handheld game console developed and manufactured by Nintendo. It is a slimmer, brighter, and more lightweight redesign of the Nintendo DS, designed to be aesthetically sleeker while taking styling cues from the Game Boy Advance SP, and to appeal to broader commercial audiences. It was announced on January 26, 2006, more than a month before its initial release in Japan on March 2, 2006 due to overwhelming demand for the original model.[3]  It has been released in Australia, North America, Europe, New Zealand, Singapore, and defined regions in South America, the Middle East, and East Asia. As of September 30, 2009, shipments of the DS Lite have reached 84.49 million units worldwide, according to Nintendo.[4]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
