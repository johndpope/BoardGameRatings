							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Midgard Variants</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Midgard Variants are a trio of new ships produced by Midgard Shipyards. These progress-level seven designs are based on alien specifications recently discovered in the ancient ruins of a sunken city. While fully capable of operation in deep space, these vessels also function at full capacity while submerged. Rejected by the ConFed military these unique, cutting-edge vessels are now for hire to the highest bidder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atlantis is a light carrier and the flagship of the Midgard line. It carries 20 fighters and a crew of 160. Also presented in this installment are Partisan (an extended version of the Atlantis, carrying 36 fighters and a larger crew compliment) and Corvus. Built for patrol and escort duties, this frigate does not carry any fighters but is still heavily armed and a force to be reckoned with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     27 page PDF file detailing the ships, interior locations, and personnel.&lt;br/&gt;     Open Game License stats provided for the vessels, crew, and fighters on board.&lt;br/&gt;     Though they use the same set of map pages, separate stats, composite maps, and exterior views are provided for all three ships.&lt;br/&gt;     Map Books&lt;br/&gt;         Four full-color page PDF files (89 pages total) containing complete interior maps at &amp;quot;1 inch = 5 feet&amp;quot; scale.&lt;br/&gt;         A separate book is provided for each of the 4 decks, making it easier to print out the maps for the variant designs.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
