			<description>From the front cover of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game about resource management, strategy, outwitting the GM, and telling a cool story to justify all the stuff you want to do with game mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OR&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game about adventurous types out looking to recover lost artifacts, mighty weapons of power, and ancient relics. The default setting of the game is a soft sci-fi post-apocalyptic world where high-tech items may still exist in ruined cities, forgotten bomb shelters, hidden compounds, or remote and inhospitable wilderness regions. You can also send people looking for treasure in the pulp age, or on distant worlds, or in a fantasy realm if you like. Most of the setting stuff is just window dressing that will affect how things are described but not how the game mechanics work.&lt;br/&gt;The game is written for a group of 3-6 people, one to GM. Someday I will add rules for one-on-one play. You will need pencils, paper, ten-sided dice (at least 3, maybe 3 per player), and some kind of chips or beads or markers in four distinct colors. (You could use several decks of playing cards, treating each suit as a color.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
