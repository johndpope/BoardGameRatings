			<description>Free translation of the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the gate of Raveleijn the adventure begins for Joost, Thomas, Emma, Lisa and Maurits. Here starts a dangerous excursion through the woods, on the way to free the city Raveleijn. As knights you fight together against malicious Graffers. Use your special strength to become as strong as possible for the ultimate fight. &lt;br/&gt;In the final battle the powerful count Graveheart awaits you. Only the bravest knights survive this last fight. &lt;br/&gt;Who becomes the hero of Raveleijn?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This family game was made to promote the new attraction 'Raveleijn' in the Efteling amusement park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the game: Free Ravelijn city of the mean count Graveheart and his Graffers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a color and the accompanying character. Each character has a special characteristic that he can use in the fights against the Graffers.&lt;br/&gt;On one side of the board you will fight against the Graffers by rolling the dice. Other players can come to help you. For each &amp;quot;hit&amp;quot; you get a card. After the defeat of all the Graffers (5), the board will be turned and you will prepare for the final fight against count Graveheart.&lt;br/&gt;The player who has the smallest value with the obtained cards gives up his character and will play count Graveheart. &lt;br/&gt;The obtained cards from the previous round will give you life points for this fight. The better you fought the Graffers, the stronger you are to fight count Graveheart!!&lt;br/&gt;Each time you can beat the count in a fight, you will get a coin. As soon as the count looses all his life points, the player that has the majority of the coins wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;Count Graveheart wins the game if he can defeat all other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
