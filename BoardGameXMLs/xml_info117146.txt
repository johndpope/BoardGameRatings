			<description>The game contains four player boards with images of different environments (concert hall, countryside, kindergarten, street), 32 tiles with images of things making sounds and compact disc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When player hears the sound corresponding to his environment he must find the tile presenting the source of the sound.

Game ends when all tiles are taken. Player with most of tiles wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
