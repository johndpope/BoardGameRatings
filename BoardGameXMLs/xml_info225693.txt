			<description>Up &amp;amp; Down is a trick-taking game which uses a traditional 52-card deck (1-13 in four suits), one special double-sided Up and Down Card as well as two dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players compete over multiple rounds based on the number of players. Players are dealt a hand of cards. The number of cards depends on the number of players. The trump is determined by rolling the two dice (the trump is always between 2-12). Players win the trick if they play the highest or lowest card depending on the special Up &amp;amp; Down Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most tricks at the end of the game is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
