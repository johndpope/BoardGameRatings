			<description>Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Snake (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also known by the name Blockade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Snake is a video game first released during the mid 1970s in arcades and has maintained popularity since then, becoming something of a classic. After it became the standard pre-loaded game on Nokia phones in 1998, Snake found a massive audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food (or some other item), trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the &amp;quot;walls&amp;quot; that surround the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult. The user controls the direction of the snake's head (up, down, left, or right), and the snake's body follows. The player cannot stop the snake from moving while the game is in progress, and cannot make the snake go in reverse. However, Snake has had many variations since its release, depending on the game's platform. These variations involve the modification of certain rules e.g. the lethality of contact with walls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
