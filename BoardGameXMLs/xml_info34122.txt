							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Buy A Vacation</name>
									
			<description>Here is where you try and earn enough to buy a vacation; doesn't sound that exciting and while it seems to have some inspiration from Monopoly - the theme at least makes it different.  It does not have an ability to trade, so there will be less player interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
