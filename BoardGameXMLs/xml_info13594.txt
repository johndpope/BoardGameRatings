			<description>An European version of Monopoly. You have a car and drive around the board (European cities instead of streets). You can buy them or buy petrol-stations (instead of railway-stations). You can buy drive-in restaurants (instead of houses) or motels (yes, indeed...).&lt;br/&gt;The Service and All-Risk-cards are in four languages (English, French, German and of course Dutch for it's a game from Holland). &lt;br/&gt;Winner is he who has all the money and properties, or he who has the most after a certain agreed time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
