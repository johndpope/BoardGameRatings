							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Magic: The Gathering (MicroProse)</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Magic: The Gathering is a computer game published by MicroProse in April 1997 based on the collectible card game Magic: The Gathering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in the plane of Shandalar, where the player must travel the land and fight random enemies to gain cards, and defeat five wizards representing the five colors. The player must prevent one color from gaining too much power, and defeat the planeswalker Arzakon, who has a deck of all five colors. Adventure game and role-playing game elements are present, including inventory, gold, towns, dungeons, random battles, and character progression in the form of new abilities and a higher life point total. An oversized version of Aswan Jaguar was included in the game box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two related products were released, the expansion pack Spells of the Ancients and Duels of the Planeswalkers. Duels of the Planeswalkers was an improved version of the main game that didn't require the original to be installed.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Magic:_The_Gathering_(MicroProse),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
