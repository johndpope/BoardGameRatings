			<description>To Glory Rise is a high speed, no holds barred airship race set in a steampunk world. Players take command of rival airships out to win at any cost. Roll the dice and assign power to your engines and cannons. Head for the gates and the win, but beware your opponents they're bound to have a cannon with your name on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to be the first airship to pass through all of the numbered gates and complete the race, or be the last airship still flying. Players will select rival airships and compete with speed and deadly cannon fire to win the challenge and prove themselves as the world's greatest airship captain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This tabletop game is designed to be played anywhere you have the time to play. All that is required are the game pieces and a ruler or two, and you can setup a race track and start playing. The game scales for up to six players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
