			<description>The game consists of a wooden box containing 9 wooden tiles numbered 1 to 9 printed on both sides of the tile, one side yellow and the other pink, and an additional tile without numbers. At the beginning of the game the tiles are mixed and placed all with the same color side up in the back of the box. One side of the playing area is marked yellow and the other pink. The players decide which one is playing with each colored edege.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting player then pushes the unnumbered tile against any tile, causing thus one tile to be push out of the gaming area. The newly placed tile must show the opposite color of the starting one. The second player takes the tile slid out and uses it now as above. The game ends after 8 moves, when only one tile of the original color remains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who gets the higher score by adding the three tiles placed on his colored edge. The unnumbered tile counts  as zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
