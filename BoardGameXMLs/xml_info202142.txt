			<description>From inside the binder on the first page:&lt;br/&gt;The Traveller Adventure Titled Shadows was used as the Traveller Tournament situation at WinterWar 1980, held at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, January 18, 19 and 20, 1980&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pre-Publication Draft&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is 3-hole punched in a Black &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; Traveller Binder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These were sold at the GDW booth at Origins 1980 is is believed (I'm trying to follow up with Marc Miller on this).  I know that at least 10 were sold and perhaps more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was eventually turned in one of the two adventures in Traveller: Double Adventure #1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
