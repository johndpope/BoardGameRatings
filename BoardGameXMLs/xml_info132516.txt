			<description>Whether you play as a witch, a shaman, a druid or a mage, Miramagia is all about magic &amp;ndash; and tending your very own magic garden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player starts the game with fun lessons on growing herbs, plants and magical shrubs. After learning your first spells, you must take care of a newly-hatched baby dragon. Bring up your creature properly and you will have a powerful companion later in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s just the beginning: your hero will be confronted with ever-increasing challenges as the game progresses. You must improve your garden, tend to rare plants and learn powerful spells. There are spells for nearly everything &amp;ndash; from a quick rain spell to changing entire climate zones. You also find you have more commitments to your village community &amp;ndash; for example, the village tree must be watered regularly and there are joint competitions against neighboring villages and valleys. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget &amp;ndash; more adventures await just beyond your doorstep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Miramagia looks fantastic: The lovingly-detailed gaming world is made up of hand-drawn graphics and brought to life with atmospheric animations. It&amp;rsquo;s not surprising that Miramagia was developed by Cologne-based development studio Bright Future &amp;ndash; a company with an excellent reputation among players and developers alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
