			<description>Prosterno is the classical logical game created by Marek Łukaszewicz in March 2010. This strategic game for two players is played on the board 8x9 squares.  The pawn under attack must jump horizontally or vertically over an empty square to the next square of the same color behind it and when it is not possible it is taken off the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to reach the opponent's side of the board or to eliminate all the opponent's pawns.&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 9 pawns at the beginning of the match&lt;br/&gt;The capturing is obligatory&lt;br/&gt;1. The pawns can move only diagonally, one square at a time in four directions.&lt;br/&gt;2. When two or more opposing pawns are in adjacent squares, then:&lt;br/&gt;        a. The pawn under attack must jump horizontally or&lt;br/&gt;           vertically over an empty square to the next&lt;br/&gt;           square of the same colour behind it, but  should&lt;br/&gt;           remain on the same straight line as the&lt;br/&gt;           attacking pawn.&lt;br/&gt;        b. If the pawn cannot escape to the second square&lt;br/&gt;           (because it is already occupied or if it is at the edge of&lt;br/&gt;           the board), it is taken off the board.&lt;br/&gt;        c.  If the escape brings the escaping pawn into contact&lt;br/&gt;            with an opponent&amp;rsquo;s pawn, it must attack it in&lt;br/&gt;            the same move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
