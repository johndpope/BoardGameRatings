							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Weak Pleasure</name>
									
			<description>This is a short scenario for 4-6 characters of approximately 3rd or 4th rank, set in the western lands of the fief of Baron Aldred in the kingdom of Albion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure can be used in one of two ways. It was originally written for convention play, to demonstrate the Dragon Warriors game to people who hadn't played it before. If used this way, should be playable to conclusion in 2-4 hours, depending on the gamesmaster's pace and the players&amp;rsquo; familiarity with the basics of roleplaying. A selection of pregenerated characters is provided at the end of the text. &lt;br/&gt; Alternatively, you should be able to slot A Weak Pleasure into any other existing campaign, including published ones like Sleeping Gods. It can be transplanted to any location in Ellesland or the northern part of the world without too much difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
