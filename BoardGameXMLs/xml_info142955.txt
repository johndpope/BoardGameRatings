			<description>Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. today announced Gran Turismo&amp;reg;6 (GT6&amp;trade;), the latest version of PlayStation&amp;reg;&amp;rsquo;s best-selling franchise, will be released in Holiday, 2013. The news was revealed today by legendary Gran Turismo creator Kazunori Yamauchi at an event held to celebrate 15 years of the 70-million-selling series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GT6 for PlayStation&amp;reg;3 will bring new levels of authenticity to &amp;lsquo;the Real Driving Simulator&amp;rsquo; as well as introducing stunning new tracks and cars and a revised user interface. A new compact game engine will improve operation and increase the flexibility to expand it with downloadable content. Meanwhile, the game is also set for expanded connectivity with other devices such as smart phones and tablets and increased social and community functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the cars and tracks from Gran Turismo&amp;reg;5, which has sold over 10m copies since launching in 2010, will be retained in GT6. But notable new additions to the already impressive line-up of historic cars, road cars and the latest race cars, brings the total car list to 1200 at launch, with new cars set to be continually added online. Several thousand aerodynamic parts and custom wheels will be available for almost all cars, and players can personalize their own custom cars in game to the greatest ever level possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UK&amp;rsquo;s famous Silverstone Circuit will be just one of seven new locations in Gran Turismo 6, taking the total to 33, with 71 different layouts available, 19 of them brand new. There will also be regular additions of new tracks set to be made available online. The improved course maker function will provide gorgeous scenery spanning several tens of square kilometers including the magnificent backdrop of Andaluc&amp;iacute;a.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of Gran Turismo&amp;rsquo;s innovative collaborations with partner companies will increase with the inception of GT6. A number of exciting new projects that blur the line between the virtual and real will be announced in the run up to the game&amp;rsquo;s launch. Not least of these is GT Academy, a collaboration with Nissan to unearth real racing driver talent that first ran in 2008. It was announced during the event that the competition returns for its biggest ever year in 2013, with the entry mechanic set to take place on an exclusive GT6 demo in July.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other notable partnerships in the development of GT6 have been with tire manufacturer Yokohama Rubber and suspension company KW Automotive. Both companies are active in the commercial car industry and in racing, and they have acted as technical development partners for the game&amp;rsquo;s new physics engine, for its tire and suspension kinematic modeling, creating an even more realistic experience for GT fans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
