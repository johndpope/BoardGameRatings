							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Krasue (5E)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Name: Krasue&lt;br/&gt;Source: Thai Mythology&lt;br/&gt;Alternate Names: Cursed Princess (or Prince); Ahp, Palasik, Kuyang, Leak, Poppo, Parakang, and Selaq Meterm.&lt;br/&gt;Alignment: Neutral Evil&lt;br/&gt;Ecology: Swamp; Solitary (Undead)&lt;br/&gt;Communication: none; the only sound it makes it the thumping of its beating heart or the gnashing of its teeth&lt;br/&gt;Ability/Skill Focus: Fly (+perfect), grapple (using its intestines to entangle), natural attack (bite + con damage), disease&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Light radiating from its mouth causes a dazzle effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description &amp;ndash; A faint rhythmic thumping sound grows more prevalent as a disembodied head floats towards you, dragging beneath it a tangle of intestines and pulsating organs. It appears as if a person&amp;rsquo;s insides were rend whole from their body. Fluttering eyes focus unevenly forward as it drifts nearer. The beating of its heart quickens pace as its intestines begin to flail like tentacles. Its mouth gapes wide and from within a blinding light pierces the darkness of night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information &amp;ndash; The krasue is a nocturnal female undead/vampire-like creature from Thai mythology. Its disembodied floating humanoid head suspends a mass of internal organs, and it is accompanied by a luminescent glow. It feeds upon the blood and flesh of the living.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The krasue floats about under cover of night, but must return to its hidden body during daylight hours or it begins to die. During the day is remains hidden in a state of hibernation until the sun sets. If a krasue cannot return to its body after a few days the krasue is destroyed. Likewise, if its hidden body is destroyed, the krasue is immediately destroyed. For this reason the krasue hides its body at a location which is difficult terrain for its potential enemies (deep caverns, a forgotten tomb, or buried deep in swamp muck). The head and body do not age, and are perfectly preserved in a youthful state. There are two ways a krasue comes into being &amp;ndash; the first being a powerful curse cast upon a dying lady of royal descent, or alternatively, a sorceress suffering a catastrophic failure while wielding powerful primal/wild magic. The krasue can smell the living, and it is particularly attracted to the scent of fresh blood which it can detect in a range of miles with perfect accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
