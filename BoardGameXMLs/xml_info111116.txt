			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome, agents&amp;hellip; We have a situation in the U.S. One of our Company specialists, NSA Analyst Dr. Ryan Forsythe, was killed&lt;br/&gt;when a freak electrical surge detonated the personal computer in his home study. The resulting fire spread quickly, consuming everything in his office. But we believe that his most critical findings are hidden somewhere in his day station, suite 14 of the Rivercrest Fellowship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rivercrest is a front for NSA research staff who sift through unconnected data brought in by U.S. field agents. Dr. Forsythe occasionally mirrors their findings to us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We believe that Dr. Forsythe stumbled onto a Shop operation, and that he was killed before he could transmit the information from his home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your mission is to infiltrate the Rivercrest facility and determine what Dr. Forsythe found. Establishing the cause of his death is equally vital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We can only assume that Dr. Forsythe&amp;rsquo;s death has attracted the attention of NSA intelligence, who are unaware of our network or Forsythe&amp;rsquo;s link to us. You are to avoid detection at all costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all agents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t make a mess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
