							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The City of Valoria: A Guide for Game Masters</name>
									
			<description>From the inside cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volume is an introduction to the world of Mythras, designed for game masters wishing to run adventures in this setting. It focuses on a particular part of this world: the great city of Valoria, the foremost stronghold of humankind. Here you will find details of the geography, culture, social and political structures of Valoria; descriptions of its many districts and neighborhoods; and a guide to the lands immediately surrounding the city, for those bold enough to venture beyond its fortified walls. The materials here are presented in a system-agnostic format, designed to be easily adaptable into your favorite fantasy RPG rules system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book has been produced as part of the backer rewards for Dwarven Forge&amp;rsquo;s epic Castles Kickstarter campaign. It is an abbreviated version of a future sourcebook that will further detail Valoria and Mythras, the fantasy setting created by Dwarven Forge&amp;rsquo;s founder, Stefan Pokorny--the place where for decades he has set his famous adventure games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you enjoy your visit here&amp;mdash;more awaits! The future sourcebook will include extensive additional material on both Valoria and the great continent of Mythras, enough for many years of memorable gaming. Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
