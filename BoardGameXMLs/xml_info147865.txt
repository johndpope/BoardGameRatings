							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rondo</name>
									
			<description>Rondo is played on a board of five concentric rings of twelve spaces each. One player has black pieces and starts on the innermost ring, the other has white pieces and starts on the outermost ring. The object is to connect the innermost and outermost rings with an unbroken chain of your pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces can move outward, inward, diagonally inward or outward, or around the ring they are in. However, Black can only move outward and clockwise and White can only move inward and counterclockwise. Pieces must jump opposing pieces when able to do so (the jumped pieces are not captured).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in the December 1982 issue of GAMES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
