							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Snapshots: A Missionary Card Game</name>
									
			<description>A second game by the Church Missionary Society, educating people about their work around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played rather like Happy Families in that you must ask a player of your choice for a card from a set that you already a card in that set. Eventually all 12 sets will have been completed. Now the game uses its educational purpose as players need to know something about the territory related to a set. Reference sheets are provided for the sort of information required. If information is not forthcoming, or the information provided is incorrect, the player loses that set. This continues until all sets have been 'challenged' and the winner of the game is the player with the most sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
