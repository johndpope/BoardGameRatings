			<description>Max the Mischievous has cast a spell that imprisoned Clarissa the Dragon in a magic cage high up in Rose Castle. The Princesses Blossom, Willow, Luna and Grace ask Max to let Clarissa go, but Max hid the key to the cage in the top tower of the castle instead. The Princesses race Max to the top of Rose Castle to get the key to set Clarissa free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a 48 piece floor sized jigsaw puzzle. After assembling the board the 3D castle is placed in the middle.  Each player spins the spinner and advances the character the arrow lands on one space. The Princesses may also all move forward a space, or backwards a space. If any Princess gets to the top first, the players win. If Max gets to the top first, he wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
