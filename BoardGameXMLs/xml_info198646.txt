			<description>Crown and Council is a fast-paced strategy game about conquering land and obliterating rival monarchs. Click adjacent land tiles to subdue them with your army, earning gold to fund further expeditions, defensive forts, naval attacks, universities and more. Muscle your opposition off the map! There can be only one ruler in these lands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s simple to play, but not quite so easy to win: do you spend all your cash on universities, hoping to survive long enough that your book-learnin&amp;rsquo; makes you unstoppable in the late game? Or do yo go for a quick land-grab, hoping to put enough boots on the ground to give you an irreversible early advantage?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
