			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is intended to find comedy in the brain of James Bond. It follows 007 on a mission to Casino Royal where he is up against the notorious gun runner &amp;quot;The Big Tuna&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game progress is scripted.  Play involves collaborative narrative construction around the scripted events.  This game originally was developed for Little Game Chef 2010 but violated one of the design constraints, and was not submitted.  The rules were reworked (primarily in the setting and scenario) and submitted to the competition under the title &amp;quot;The Big Tuna&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
