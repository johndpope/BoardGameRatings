			<description>In this game players compete to find magical artifacts from an ancient maze. The maze is enchanted and players can change its layout using only their minds. This way they can help themselves in their search or hinder their opponents. Coins placed number up on the maze represent either monsters (stronger the bigger the number on the coin) or artifacts (if the suit, revealed only to the player that lands there, matches the player's suit). First player to find 3 artifacts and exit the maze wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was designed to be played with a piecepack set and a pentominoes set (e.g. Quintillions). The pentomino pieces are the walls for the maze. It gives a nice 3D feel to the game (each square section of the pentomino pieces has to be of the same approximate size as the small squares from the piecepack tiles). If you don't have a pentominos set, there's an alternative mechanic, although it changes the game a bit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
