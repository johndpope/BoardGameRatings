			<description>The &amp;quot;Kochtopf-Spiel&amp;quot; (=cooking pot game) was included as &amp;quot;Spiel im Heft&amp;quot; (game in the zine) in Spielbox 6/87, where 3 games were published, that could be played with special miniature fruit figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game needs 5 of these fruit figures: 1 tomato, 1 paprika, 1 onion, 1 mushroom and as special figure 1 corncob.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board shows 5x5 spaces, where five 3x3 areas are specially marked. Each area is reserved for one playing figure, that is each figure can only move within its area.&lt;br/&gt;The four 3x3 areas in the corners are reserved for the 4 normal playing figures, the area in the middle is the corncob's one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a set of 8 cards: 4 showing a fruit figure and 4 are numbered from 1-4. These cards are used to move the playing pieces, but a move is always put together from 2 cards from 2 different players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to move 3 of the 4 normal figures in the centre area and get the corncob to one of the corners of his area. The player who sits nearest to that corner is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
