							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">First Bull Run: 150th Anniversary Edition</name>
									
			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;July 21, 1861: In northern Virginia two raw armies prepare to do battle in what each believes will be a short war. Spectators have gathered for the spectacle. Both sides are in for a shock as this will be the first major battle in a war that will last another four years and consume 600,000 lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now for the 150th anniversary of the battle, Worthington Games brings you, First Bull Run: 150th Anniversary Edition. Players will take control of either the Confederate and Union armies, blue and gray wooden blocks with labels, on a mounted 22&amp;quot; x 17&amp;quot; map of the Manassas area, cards, and rules. The game will come with a certificate stating that it is a copy of 525 limited edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First Bull Run: 150th Anniversary Edition lasts nine turns, with each player receiving 8-14 cards per turn from an individual deck of 20 cards. Each turn is divided into a number of rounds, with players alternating rounds until both pass or both run out of cards; during a round, a player can play 0-5 cards, using each card for its movement point value or its action. After playing one or more cards in a round, the active player can attack a defender's units with adjacent, facing units. Each unit may move/attack or be attacked only once per round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, players score victory points for the opposing units they've eliminated as well as the victory point locations they occupy. Whoever scores more points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
