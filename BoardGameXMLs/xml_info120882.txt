							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">La Course à l&#039;Élysée</name>
									
			<description>In La Course &amp;agrave; l'&amp;Eacute;lys&amp;eacute;e, players take the roles of a candidate in the presidential election and each player also is given a party. Your goal is to seduce the French. Under the spotlight, you multiply the televised debates. During these face-to-face with your opponents, you expose your political agenda, with ideas hastily prepared by your campaign team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A pawn to your color evolves on a board representing the steps of the Elysee. Depending on the square where you are you should follow the instructions of a card or participate in a challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may use dirty tricks and ideas you have borrowed from others, you will choose an opponent for the debate which will be refereed by a &amp;quot;journalist&amp;quot;, the player next to you whose role will be to control the time allowed to each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
