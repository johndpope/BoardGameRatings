			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Pursuit of The Mind Masters is the third in a high-level series of adventures written for the post-apocalyptic role-playing game, Darwin's World. It is part of a campaign revolving around the mysterious overlords known as the &amp;quot;Savants&amp;quot;, and as befits an adventure of epic proportions, takes the player characters from the familiar desert setting of the Twisted Earth across the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico, ending on the swampy shores of what was once known as &amp;quot;Louisiana&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Pursuit of The Mind Masters is designed for characters around 18th to 19th level. Characters who went through the first adventure in this series (Secrets of The Mind Masters) should have advanced to 18th level, and by the end of the second installment (Return of The Mind Masters) the player characters should have attained level 19. This adventure should take them all the way through to 20th.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AUTHOR&amp;rsquo;S NOTE Originally the &amp;quot;Mind Masters&amp;quot; series of adventures was intended to be a trilogy, but the last installment, Last Gambit of The Mind Masters, proved too large and unwieldy to be contained within one adventure. As a result, the first part of that storyline has been condensed into its own separate module, In Pursuit of The Mind Masters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
