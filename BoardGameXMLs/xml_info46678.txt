			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anchors aweigh! The fierce Sea of Dread is all that lies between you and a fiery mountain of gold. The challenge is yours alone in this new solo adventure for character levels 4-6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KIDNAPPED! The cursed Baron von Hendriks has kidnapped your betrothed. Now the madman wants as a ransom your Alandah's weight in unrefined gold! How are you going to pay?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The baron himself has been kind enough to provide you with that answer: streams of raw gold gush from a burning mountain somewhere in the Sea of Dread. All you have to do is find this mysterious mountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UNFURL THE SAILS! The open sea awaits you and your crew as you sail from the city harbor. But beware! The Sea of Dread has more than earned its title over the centuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you survive the perils of the sea? Will your crew mutiny before you reach the Burning Mountain? Or will you have to throw the crewmembers overboard just to make room for the gold? It's all up to you in this D&amp;amp;D&amp;reg; Solo Adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lathan's Gold is for one player only, but that one player may choose between several different characters and quests. The adventure includes city, voyage, and island encounters, as well as a complete solo combat system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
