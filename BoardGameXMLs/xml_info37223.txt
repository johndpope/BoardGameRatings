			<description>An antique baseball game played on a wooden board which depicts a baseball field. The rules and a die rolling chart are also printed on the board. The board is approximately 20x20 inches. The other components include a pair of dice and a set of markers used to represent base runners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played using a chart which determines the results of each pitch by rolling two six-sided dice. The chart lists each pair of numbers that could be thrown and gives a result for each pairing. The results include a base hit, a &amp;quot;two base hit&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;three base hit&amp;quot;, getting on base by error, getting on base by balls, one strike, foul out, out at first, fly out, double play, triple play, and home run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
