							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Das Feldherrnspiel</name>
									
			<description>This is a WWII-era German game similar to L'Attaque or the later Stratego. The playing board is only seven spaces wide and 14 rows deep, with four 2-space blanks in the middle rows that force attacks to go through the remaining three channels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing pieces are wooden triangles that stand up so only the owning player can see their values. Players set up freely on their side of the board and than move them one at a time to attack opposing pieces and eventually capture the enemy flag piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each side has 33 pieces, ranging in value from 11 (Scharfshutze or Sharpshooter) to 1 (Feldmarschall or Field Marshal). In general, the lower value beats the higher value, with equal values causing mutual destruction. However, the Scharfshutze kills the Feldmarschall while losing to everything else, and Mines kill anything that attacks them, but cannot move or attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
