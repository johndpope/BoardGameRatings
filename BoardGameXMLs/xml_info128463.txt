			<description>Welcome to the world of Diggin Deep Baseball.  With this game, you should be able to re-create the game of baseball complete with all the strategy and decisions that the big league manager make on a daily basis.  You set the rosters.  You pick your rotation.  You make the lineups.  All of the game strategies are here.  Do I steal a base?  Do I pinch hit?  Do I leave my pitcher in for one more batter?  Diggin Deep Baseball also re-creates dilemmas that not every tabletop baseball game can re-create.  Does my slugger dig deep now in hopes for a big inning, or save that for later in the game?  My pitcher is hurt, but says he&amp;rsquo;s fine.  Do I yank him now, or keep him in and take the chance that the injury might be more severe?  My all-star catcher has a death in the family and has been put on the bereavement list.  How do I replace his offense?  His defense?  Along with the above, there are several aspects of Diggin Deep Baseball that you&amp;rsquo;ll find makes this a complete tabletop baseball game.&lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;Games are played using cards and three ten sided dice.  There are cards provided for every batter with 50ab's and pitchers with at least 25ip.  In a normal at bat sequence, the three ten sided dice create a number from 1 to 1000.  Results of 1 to 500 come from the hitter's card, and 501 to 1000 come from the pitcher's card to resolve the plate appearance.  &lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;What sets Diggin Deep Baseball apart from other games is the Diggin Deep Mechanism.  In certain game situations, players can 'Dig Deep' for that little bit extra to tilt the scales in their favor.  In a normal situation, there is a 50/50 chance the  result comes off the hitter's card or the pitcher's card.  When a player 'Digs Deep', that 50/50 chance now becomes 100/0.  This doesn't guarantee a positive result, but it does give you a better chance of success.&lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;Diggin Deep Baseball is played just like a real baseball game.  This includes relief pitchers, pinch hitters, pinch runners, injuries, and ejections.  Once you have gameplay down, you should be able to play a full nine inning game in about 30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
