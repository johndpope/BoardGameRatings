			<description>In Erd&amp;ouml;s Latino, an abstract strategy game, two players face off, placing numbers (1&amp;ndash;5) in a 5&amp;times;5 square grid.  There are five of each number.  On your turn, simply place a number in a space on the grid, such that neither its row nor its column contains another instance of that number.  There are two ways to win:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Block your opponent from making a play.&lt;br/&gt;     When the board is full, be the player who has claimed more columns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You claim a column when you are the first player to form a sequence of three numbers, increasing away from you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play with several different levels of information to the players:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Random &amp;mdash; You blindly draw the tile you must play.&lt;br/&gt;     Perfect Information &amp;mdash; The tiles form a face-up, shared pool; you take the tile you want.&lt;br/&gt;     Mixed &amp;mdash; Shuffle the tiles face-down, then give thirteen to the start player, and twelve to the other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
