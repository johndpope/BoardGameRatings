							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 (And More) Male Pictish First Names</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Picts occupied the area of what is roughly today's central and northern Scotland, and are believed to have been descended from the tribes which the Romans built Hadrian's Wall to defend against. The Picts themselves were subsumed by the Scots by the eleventh century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not much is known of the Pictish language; it's believed to be Gaelic, but the meanings of the words has been lost. Almost the only words to survive are men's names, and it is an extinct language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement has 100 different male Pictish names listed, suitable for a Gaelic or Celtic-inspired regions for players and NPCs. The meanings of the names have been lost, but there are some alternative spellings, resulting in more than the 100 specific names listed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
