			<description>ABOUT TOWER OF GUNS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tower of Guns is a fast paced shooter for the twitch gamer&amp;hellip; with a few roguelike-like-ish elements to keep it fresh with each playthrough. Think of it like FTL or Binding of Isaac mixed with Doom2/Quake!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KEY FEATURES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- SINGLE SITTING FULL EXPERIENCE: For all of those who have too many games (or too little time) this is a game you can pick up and play again and again without remembering where you were or what you were up to. If you&amp;rsquo;re gonna win, you&amp;rsquo;re gonna do it within an hour or two. That&amp;rsquo;s a big if though&amp;hellip; it won&amp;rsquo;t be easy.&lt;br/&gt; - ALWAYS A FRESH EXPERIENCE: Random enemies, random powerups, random bosses, tons of unlockable items and weapons&amp;hellip;even random-level compositing! You never know what to expect when you sit down in front of Tower of Guns.&lt;br/&gt; - CRAZY POWERUPS: You&amp;rsquo;ve played first person shooters where you can double jump, but have you played any game where you can centuple-jump? You can in Tower of Guns, with the right items.&lt;br/&gt; - GUN-MODIFYING MADNESS: A gun and its qualities aren&amp;rsquo;t tied together in Tower of Guns. Do you like rocket launchers? You&amp;rsquo;ll like them more if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky enough to stumble upon a &amp;ldquo;shotgun&amp;rdquo; modifier. A rocket-launching shotgun is very satisfying.&lt;br/&gt; - OLD-SCHOOL TACTICS: For the fans of the faster shooters, it&amp;rsquo;s all back: circle strafing, bunny hopping, rocket jumping. Tower of Guns is all about moving fast!&lt;br/&gt; - NO LIMIT LEVEL DESIGN: Hate invisible blocking walls that keep you from exploring a cool vista? I do. They&amp;rsquo;re outlawed in Tower of Guns. If you can see it, you can get to it&amp;hellip;if you have the right items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
