			<description>The White Squadron is a set-building card game similar to the children's game &amp;quot;Fish&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Go Fish.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 52 cards in the deck depict warships of the U.S. Navy around the turn of the century. It was evidently printed in many editions because at least one copy seems to date from about 1919 based on the ships depicted, even though the original copyright date is 1896.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ships are divided into &amp;quot;fleets&amp;quot; of four similar ships, mostly historical class sister ships ranking from &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; through &amp;quot;M&amp;quot; with each ship in the fleet numbered from &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; though &amp;quot;4.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, the &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; fleet comprises the battleships Oklahoma, Nevada, New York and Texas. The &amp;quot;M&amp;quot; fleet comprises the submarines Plunger, Porpoise, Shark and Moccasin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card lists its identifying number &amp;quot;A-1, M-4&amp;quot;; the name of the ship in larger type with the sister ships in smaller type; a photograph or drawing of the ship and a three-line description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, the Plunger's description reads: &amp;quot;PLUNGER -- Submarine torpedo boat. Holland type, operated by gasoline when in the surface and electricuty when submerged. 63 feet long. Has 3 14-inch Whitehead torpedoes for sub-sea attack.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to collect &amp;quot;fleets&amp;quot; of four cards with the winner being the player with the most &amp;quot;fleets&amp;quot; at the end of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five cards are dealt to each player with the surplus forming a common draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player to the dealer's left begins by asking any one player for a specific card . For example, &amp;quot;Do you have H-3 Massachusetts?&amp;quot; If the player has the card he must give it to the caller, who can then ask for another card from anyone around the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the targeted player doesn't have the card, then the caller must draw one card from the draw pile and play passes to the left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once four cards in the same fleet are collected the player paces them down on the table face up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player has no cards then he is entitled to draw two cards from the draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the draw pile is exhausted, play continues with the cards in hand only until all the fleets are formed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules don't say, but presumably players who have no cards and can't draw from the draw pile can still continue to play and acquire cards for a fleet, although they would be vulnerable to poaching from other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
