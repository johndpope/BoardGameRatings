							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Knarly Hexes</name>
									
			<description>Knarly Hexes is a new type of logic puzzle.  The number in each cell indicates how many adjacent cells (up to 6) are the same color as that cell. When solved (correctly), each cell will be one of only two opposing colors.  To aid in the solving of the puzzle, there are 10 different pairs of opposing colors, so you can work on unconnected areas of the puzzle.  But eventually you have to decide how to merge areas with differing pairs of colors, until the entire puzzle is colored with only one color-pair.  Each puzzle is guaranteed to have only one possible solution.  Puzzles come in 8 sizes and 2 difficulty levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
