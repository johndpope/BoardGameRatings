			<description>Super All Green was originally published in 2014 for 2-4 players, and a second edition was issued in 2015 as ALL GREEN for 2-6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALL GREEN is a card game that simplifies the rules and play of Japanese Mahjong by reducing the types of cards and scoring hands. This edition is very portable, with two decks of small sized cards. One deck is the Tenbo cards, showing scoring points in values of 10P, 5P and 1P. The other deck is only the green bamboo suite (Ryuiso), hence the game being called all Green. The other Mahjong suites and tiles, such as Dragons, are not represented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in Mahjong, players repeatedly draw a card from the deck and discard one from their hand, trying to build a scoring combination from the five cards they hold after drawing. The combinations in All Green are simply a pair (the Head), and either a Run (Shuntsu) or a Meld.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based upon the value of the winning hand, players discard their points cards accordingly. The first player to get down to zero wins, or the player with the fewest points after two rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RULES:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Tenbo points deck, players get a 10P, two 5P, and five 1P cards, giving a total of 25 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, after shuffling the bamboo deck well, players are dealt four hand cards each. The remainder are placed face down as a draw deck. Play goes clockwise, with each player taking turns to draw one card from the deck, and discard one card from their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has a Pair and a Run or a Meld, they call and score. Then they discard Tenbo cards for the score. Players reshuffle the bamboo deck and play another round, until one players gets to zero points. More usually, play continues until everyone has lead twice, at which point the lowest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's summary:&lt;br/&gt;ソーズとハツだけの麻雀カードゲームです。&lt;br/&gt;5枚のカードを揃える簡易版の麻雀カードゲームです。&lt;br/&gt;それぞれ25点の点数を持って、点数を取り合います。&lt;br/&gt;親が2周するか、誰かの点数が0未満になると終了です。&lt;br/&gt;ALL GREEN is a simplified Mahjong card game. Unlike Mahjong which has 34 types of tiles, this game only has nine types of bamboo cards and green dragon cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players are dealt four cards each. They take turns drawing one card and discarding one card until someone completes a winning hand of one pair and a set of three cards (in sequence or of a kind). The winner gains points from opponents according to the difficulty of the winning hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players initially have 25 points. A game consists of rounds equal to twice the number of players, but may immediately end when a player has negative points.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
