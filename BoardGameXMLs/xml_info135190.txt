							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Top Hat</name>
									
			<description>TOP HAT is a resource management and market trading game where each player controls a Top Hat making company through 2 Years (8 rounds) of manufacturing and selling top hats. The in-game economy being 100% player driven, much of the strategy involved consists of being the player who can control and predict the market price of the different manufacturing goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From buying of the manufacturing goods to selling the finished product, the players control everything that was involved in manufacturing hats in the 1850&amp;rsquo;s. Market fluctuations are powerful tools for those who know how to wield them and clever use of capital will triumph over rigid business plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you become a household name in men&amp;rsquo;s fashion, or another bankrupt company soon forgotten by history?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
