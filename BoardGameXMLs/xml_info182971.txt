			<description>On behalf of the faculty and staff of Masamune Shining Forge Academy, it is with great pleasure that we inform you of your admission to Masamune. You were selected from an incredibly competitive and capable group of applicants, and showed an intense devotion to creating weapons worthy of legend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Masamune is a game for two to four players, and takes place over the course of an academic year at Masamune Shining Forge Academy. As a pupil at Masamune Shining Forge Academy, you and your opponents will start the game with identical 12-card decks. Over the course of the game, you will forge sentient weapons called Chibis and teach them powerful special techniques to defend the Academy from attacking monsters. Alternatively, you can use Chibis to gain more powerful cards and bolster your deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just like normal schools, Masamune Shining Forge Academy uses Exams to measure its pupils&amp;rsquo; academic growth. Every time a new card is added to your deck, there is a chance that the next card drawn from the Academy deck will be an Exam, an intense battle staged by your instructors that lures the monsters teeming in the surrounding forest to attack the Academy! After the fifth and final Exam is completed, the school year is over, and the pupil who harvested the most monsters has won the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
