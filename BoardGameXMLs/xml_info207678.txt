							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The County Fair Game</name>
									
			<description>The objective of The County Fair Game is to have the most fun at the county fair by spending as much of your money to win prizes, be awarded ribbons, take photos, eat food and experience the fair.  Players begin with 85 play dollars to spend at the fair.  Before entering the fair, they must first find a parking place (roll to land in spaces around the outer edge of the board.) Upon entering the fair, players roll a die each turn and can choose which space to land on (usually from several options.) The player with the most points from accumulated prizes, and experiences wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
