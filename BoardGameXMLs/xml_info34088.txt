			<description>The goal of the game is to race your raindrops down the window. The player with the most raindrops moved off the end of the window at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A modular board is used, with an extension being added for three player and a further extension for four player.  Cards are drawn that dictate the number of raindrops added to the board and the movement of the raindrops. To progress down the board larger raindrops are required at each row. Any raindrop moved off the end of the board is collected. At the end of the game the number of individual drops collected is totaled and the player with the highest number of drops wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
