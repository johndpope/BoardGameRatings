							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cat Burglar</name>
									
			<description>Each player is a Cat Burglar (literally, a cat wearing a burglar mask), attempting to sneak into a mansion to steal some valuable jewels from the safe. If a player runs into a Police Dog (again, literally a dog dressed like a police officer) or triggers the alarm, they lose a life. Lose 9 lives, and it's game-over for that player. The first player to remove the jewels from the safe wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a roll-and-move mechanic. On his turn, a player rolls the dice, and may then decide either to move his Cat Burglar, or to move one of the two Police Dogs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is assembled from four large puzzle-piece shaped segments, which depict various rooms inside the mansion. A plastic dial is inserted into each corner of the board, which players use to track lives. A fifth board section, made from plastic, depicts the vault room, and sits in the middle of the board. This section has a safe which the players must crack, and several of the spaces on the middle section are alarmed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key feature of the game is the plastic &amp;quot;vault room&amp;quot; which sits in the middle of the board. All the spaces in the vault room are potentially alarmed - There are small metal contacts embedded in each space. Some of them are decoys, and some will trigger an alarm when the metal base of the cat burglar pieces comes into contact, completing an electronic circuit. The safe itself is a dexterity mini-game; although players are given the combination for the lock at the start of the game, if their hand shakes, or they get the combination slightly wrong, it triggers an alarm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 Mansion Room puzzle-piece board sections&lt;br/&gt;4 Coloured plastic Cat Burglar pieces with a metal base&lt;br/&gt;2 Plastic Police Dog pieces&lt;br/&gt;4 Plastic Gems (one of each player colour)&lt;br/&gt;4 Plastic dials for tracking lives (one of each player colour)&lt;br/&gt;1 Plastic vault room plus battery cover&lt;br/&gt;1 Plastic safe core plus lid&lt;br/&gt;Dice&lt;br/&gt;Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
