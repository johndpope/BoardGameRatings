							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dawnworlds, Gateway to the Open Cluster</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dawnworlds, The Gateway to the Open Cluster is a unique and exciting new space sector supplement for any S.F. roleplaying game.  Dawnworlds is different from other space supplements in that it is complete with history, detailed planet specifications, ship diagrams and deck plans, encounter matrix, and new fully described technologies.  The Open Cluster is fully maped(sp) and DAWNWORLD is written like a S.F. novel with lavish NPC developement(sp).  Also, it is written by published S.F. writters(sp) for adult S.F. enthusiasts.  The writters(sp) have sfollowed the guidelines that DAWNWORLD must be different and excitingm(sp) not just different; strange and interesting, not just weird; planned, logical, and realistic, not just a hodgepodge of ideas pulled from various S.F. books.  In this attempt the writters(sp) have suceeded(sp) admirably and have created a fantastic framework for the referee to spin his space adventure on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book is stapled sheets inside a 4-fold map that make up the cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although it claims to be for any system, much of the terminology within is very traveller specific (jump drives, Xboat routes, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
