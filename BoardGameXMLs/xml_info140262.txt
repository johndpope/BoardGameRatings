							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Breakout 2000</name>
									
			<description>Breakout 2000 is a 3-D version of the arcade classic designed for one or two players. There are a total of ten different phases to survive, each consisting of five playfields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game featured good and bad power-ups somewhat similar to Arkanoid. There were unbreakable bricks, multi-hit bricks and stacked bricks. Ball movement was limited to the lower level of stacked bricks so breaking a lower brick would allow the stacked bricks to fall into the now vacated location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also featured a two player mode that allowed two people (or a person and the computer) to compete head to head. In this mode a player's ball could loop around to the other player's playfield and break the opponent's bricks. A 2X bonus was awarded for breaking your opponent's bricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Breakout 2000&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Breakout Barrage!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SMASH! POW! CRUNCH! Is your hand/eye coordination up to demolishing field after field of bricks? Breakout 2000 brings back the nostalgia of early gaming days but adds 90's challenges, such as a three-dimensional field and bricks that resist breaking, as well as many powerups and hazards. You can also test your skill against a buddy. Break through your own wall and start working on his. You'll gain bonus points, and he'll go nuts! Who ever said life was fair never played Breakout 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
