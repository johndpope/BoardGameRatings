			<description>Madzzle is a universe of engaging games which explores the most exciting worlds on our Planet &amp;amp; beyond!It was created to give anxious parents an alternative for  their smartphone/ tablet hooked kids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Madzzle has reinvented the way world looks at Jigsaw puzzles.  Jigsaw puzzles always meant broken images,however with our patent pending  zero gap technology, we have eliminated all gaps literally in a puzzle. This also meant that the completed puzzle could in turn become a board to play endless new games. This is how we added two more games for unending fun.&lt;br/&gt;Object Hunt: In this game players race to find objects on the completed puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;Data Duel: Its a trump card style game where players square off with each other based on facts and location of the object on the      completed puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Madzzle also solves the biggest problem with Jigsaws i.e. that it is not portable and once completed have to be dismantled. With the help of our magnetic mat, Madzzle can be moved around and players can also roll up the completed puzzle and roll out the completed puzzle whenever they are in the mood for some Madzzle Fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Madzzle is available in three exciting themes- Bermuda Triangle, Mysteries of the Amazon and Worldopedia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
