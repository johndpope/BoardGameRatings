			<description>Gerontopoly game is aimed at helping health professionals and students gain greater awareness and sensitivity toward aging-related changes. The object of the game is to gain as much life satisfaction as possible without losing money, while avoiding developing chronic diseases. Players roll the dices and move their pieces around a board much as they do in similar recreational games of chance, but their &amp;quot;purchases&amp;quot; are mundane personal aids such as dentures, hearing aids and walkers. Players of Gerontopoly can find themselves detained in the nursing home, adult day care center or hospital. On the upswing, each time they pass GO, they receive $300 from Social Security. During the game, players try to avoid getting &amp;quot;Chronic Disease&amp;quot; cards and attempt to collect as many &amp;quot;Life Satisfaction&amp;quot; cards and as much money as possible. They try to accomplish this by answering various questions about aging including: *With normal aging, which declines the least--hearing, smell, taste or vision? Answering 'taste' earns the player $50. The acceptance of Gerontopoly by non-health care professionals helps to widen the scope of people learning about aging lifestyles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a 2-phase study, the acceptability and efficacy of the game was evaluated. Using a 22-item, postgame questionnaire, the 190 dental students, 23 dental hygiene students, 25 college sociology students. Results also suggest the game can change attitudes and enhance awareness about the concerns of the elderly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
