			<description>The goal is to move the pawns around the board to the &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; section (castle). Movement is controlled by dice and cards. All players move around the same board, so they may capture each other's pawns. Captured pawns are returned to the jail; if you can free them - try to throw them successfully into the castle so that they pass one gate; they must start their journey again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to move all pawns &amp;quot;home&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note:&lt;br/&gt;Game mechanisms make it seem that it should be played by children, but the theme (beer/brewery) does not match at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
