			<description>It's a well-known fact that with the wrong audience, any film can become a horror show. For the audience in Film ab! that wants to enjoy the offered blockbusters and score points, the right seating choice is the all-important factor. They want to avoid having tall men in front of them, children who are blowing bubbles in the middle of the row, or purses blocking neighboring seats. Many moviegoers also have certain preferences. They would like to sit together with their partner, be surrounded by men or women, or sit in the first row. One can only hope that before the start of a show, a riot doesn't break out and chase people away from their chosen seats. Whoever's visitors have had the most pleasure in the cinema after three rounds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Film ab! is an easily accessible, brisk family game with a funny theme that everyone knows from their everyday life. The clever placement mechanism and the different characters, each of whom one has likely  encountered in the cinema, provide great entertainment at the game table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
