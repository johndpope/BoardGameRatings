							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood Hunter</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between the martial pursuits of a warrior, and the long-forgotten secrets of blood magic, lies a sect of hunters that sacrifice their own vitality and humanity to protect the realms. Through the tutelage of hidden orders, Blood Hunters learn to give their essence to harness the elements within their weapon, manipulate the lifeblood of others through blood curses, and allow themselves to become a part of what they hunt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take the Order of the Ghostslayer, Blood Hunters honed to destroy the undead and all things that mock life. You could instead join the Order of the Profane Soul and make a pact with lesser evils to use wicked magic against the greater terrors that roam the land. You could even walk with the Order of the Mutant to harvest and imbibe the toxic remains of your quarry to mutate you body in powerful, yet dangerous, ways. This choice is yours while you traverse the path of the Blood Hunter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
