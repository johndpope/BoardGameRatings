			<description>WYSIWYG [wiz-ee-wig]: What You Steal Is What You Get. In WYSIWYG you play a light fingered thief. Your goal is to loot, pickpocket, and burgle your way to fame and riches. But watch out for the city guard! They'll put a stop to your life of crime at every turn of the die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is attempting to collect Items, everyone gets one go at stealing from the target. As you collect the items, you will trade them in at a Fence each fence is represented by a color wink. when you have 3 items with the same color wink. i.e. the locked Chest, The Ancient Tablet, and the Treasure Map. You trade them into the Green Fence. You get a Green wink to represent being &amp;quot;Solid&amp;quot; with this Fence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner is the first thief to become &amp;quot;Solid&amp;quot; with 5 of the 7 available Fences. But keep an eye out. The other thieves maybe aiming to take your ill-gotten goods from you! And with the Fence Rewards come item cards that can assist in their nefarious plans to take your loot, freeze it in place, or use a fire bomb to wipe it from existence. Because, in WYSIWYG there truly is &amp;quot;No Honor Among Thieves&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
