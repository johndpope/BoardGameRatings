			<description>from the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set 2: Nightmare in Blackmarsh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What will befall your adventurers in the village of Blackmarsh?  Will they become involved in a brawl in the tavern? Discover the fabled Black Pearl? Or save the village from dark powers rising from the Black Marsh?&lt;br/&gt;The village is fully mapped on a large colourful play-sheet for use with 25mm miniature figures.  The sheet is compatible with our Dungeon Floor Plans to allow you to adapt the village as you wish. A booklet details the village and its occupants together with adventure ideas.  The full-colour game-masters' screen provides the players with a history of the area and the game-master with Encounter Tables and a keyed village plan. A colour map of the region completes the set which can be used on its own or to link with Dungeon Planner Set 1: Caverns of the Dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
