			<description>Unlike many of the other Jax, Ltd. games, Takeaway doesn't seem to have previously existed as public domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luck seems to play a heavy part in this game, advertised as &amp;quot;strategic&amp;quot;: This is a set collection game, where you collect cards by making plays of cards between your cards and your opponents. At least, that seems to be how the game works: the instructions are well known to be less than specific.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game seems to be well regarded by younger players, perhaps because they are not as concerned with playing by the &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Verbiage from Jax, Ltd:&lt;br/&gt;Take all you can get...when you play this unique, new family card game! Collect as many cards as you can by making plays between your cards and your opponent's cards. But BEWARE....Your opponents might take them all away! The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins!! It's challenging and fun. When you change comes, take all you can get and play Takeaway!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
