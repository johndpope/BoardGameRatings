			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it unless given direct written permission from the publisher which must be noted in the image caption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Yellow King Roleplaying Game. The core game. Four books in 6&amp;quot; x 9&amp;quot; format, grouped together in a gorgeous slipcase: Paris, The Wars, Aftermath, and This Is Normal Now. Core rules appear in the Paris book, with brief setting-specific rules sections in the other three. The beautiful and ingenious slipcase includes a GM screen. Although dabblers can get just a PDF of Paris book by pledging at the introductory Dauber tier, the four books are not sold separately. When you purchase The Yellow King Roleplaying Game, you get the complete set of four.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core game comes in three editions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Standard Edition: Hardback covers for all four books. The version you'll later see in your local store.&lt;br/&gt;        Deluxe Edition: Leatherette covers for all four books, with signed bookplate. These will not be available at retail stores.&lt;br/&gt;        Ultra-Limited: Hand-altered Deluxe Editions, signed and numbered, with hand annotations and pasted-in documents and ephemera, each one unique. Only 10 copies will be sold, and these will only be available in pledge levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
