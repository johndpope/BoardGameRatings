			<description>From the publisher's webpage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are monsters out there. &lt;br/&gt;Most people don't believe in them, but they're real. Mostly, when someone finds out that monsters are real, that's just before they die.&lt;br/&gt;But some people are mean enough, smart enough, crazy enough, or hurt enough, that they live. They go on a crusade to kill the monsters.&lt;br/&gt;That's who you are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It could be that you make a stand and defend your hometown from everything evil that comes there. &lt;br/&gt;It could be you take to the road and go hunt them down. &lt;br/&gt;It could be you have magic powers. &lt;br/&gt;It could be that your name came up in prophecies thousands of years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The one sure thing is you aren't gonna go back to your old, safe life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster of the Week is a pen &amp;amp; paper roleplaying game in which you are monster hunters in a world much like ours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(user addition)&lt;br/&gt;This is the beta version of the core rulebook, released to supporters of the IndieGoGo campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
