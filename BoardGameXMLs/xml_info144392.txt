							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heart Attack or Escape from the Old Folks Home</name>
									
			<description>You are an &amp;ldquo;Old Folk&amp;rdquo; whose evil children have placed into a retirement home.  One night after an average day you drift off to sleep as usual.  In the morning you are awakened by the loudspeaker system, this is very much not usual.  It appears to be a recording.  A young insulting voice is outlining the victory, which his group achieved overnight.  You realize he is part of the youth movement, which has been threatening the establishment, as usual.  The voice declares that they have taken over the government and the first new law has been set into motion is nobody over the age of 30 is worthy of life.  However, the law had been quickly modified to allow for one &amp;ldquo;Old Folk&amp;rdquo;, as they are to be called, to be allowed to live per retirement home.  The first Old Folk to make his or her way out of the home will receive the pardon for life.  Be aware however, the entire home has been booby trapped and there will be no medical teams sent in to help the fallen.  The recording starts again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory Conditions:&lt;br/&gt;Players should agree to a victory point total before play begins, 20 points is a short game, 30 average and 40 long.  Points are scored&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to score points:&lt;br/&gt;After playing some room cards you may play a Passkey.  This will do two things, 1) will allow you to move to another Quad if you wish to.  Once the points are calculated the scorekeeper should note the player's new score and announce to all players what the score is.  There are four scoring positions, position one, two, three, and four.  The first room you play is in &amp;ldquo;Position One&amp;rdquo;, the next card your play will be in &amp;ldquo;Position Two&amp;rdquo;, then next &amp;ldquo;Position Three&amp;rdquo; and finally the fourth in &amp;ldquo;Position Four&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
