			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's time to power up for some morphinominal fun! Do you know the name of Zordon's sidekick? How about the name of the Red Samurai Ranger's signature weapon? Or can you name 3 Power Ranger seasons with the world &amp;quot;force&amp;quot; in it? Blast into the Power Rangers universe in this special Power Rangers 20th Anniversary Edition of TRIVIAL PURSUIT. For the first time ever, the Power Rangers team up with America's favorite trivia game so fans of all ages can test their knowledge of these legendary heroes with 1,800 questions covering the Power Rangers gear, the allies and villains they faced, their morphing powers and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in other Trivial Pursuit games, players roll dice to move around the board and answer trivia questions in various categories. Players earn pieces by answering correctly on certain spaces for each category, and the winner is the first to collect one of every piece and return to the middle and answer one final question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
