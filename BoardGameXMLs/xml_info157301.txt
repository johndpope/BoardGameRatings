			<description>Game of Defense: Pacific is a light wargame. It is for two sides (U.S. and &amp;quot;Asiatic&amp;quot;), each of whom has five ships each of three types (battleships, cruisers, and submarines). The ships are deployed on a map of the Pacific with a grid divided into red and white squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn a player moves one piece (or possibly more than one, as the rules are a bit unclear). Battleships and cruisers can move several squares on a turn but are restricted to squares of a particular color. Submarines only move one square a turn but can use either color. Submarines capture enemy ships by landing on them, but the larger ships capture by jumping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each side starts the game by mining ten squares on their shores; when an enemy ship crosses such a square a card is drawn which may have a bad effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each side has four objective cards which they randomly select one of at the start of the game, keeping it hidden from the opponent(s). The game is won by the side achieving its objective first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played by more than two players by dividing one or both sides between players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
