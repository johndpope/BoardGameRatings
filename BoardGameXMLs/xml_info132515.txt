							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Imperion</name>
									
			<description>It is the year 2137 and three species are battling for supremacy in space. The bitter war has raged for decades. Now all hopes rest on the player, whose task it is to settle new planets. Players lead their empires to victory with strategic skill and diplomatic finesse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imperion is a construction and management strategy game. Players choose to play one of three very different peoples: Terrans, Titans and Xen The peace-loving Titans have the best technologies. The strength of the Xen lies in fast unit production. Due to their bio-chemical abilities, they can break down and transform their units. The Terrans have the most balanced characteristics and can survive in all habitats. They are specialists in recycling raw materials. It is these different species that make Imperion so unique. Players love the complexity and the balanced gameplay that Imperion offers. The range of available strategies and the development of different galaxies gives players incredible gameplay freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, you will need to use careful resource management and the right development strategy. The further you progress, the greater the importance of communication and cooperation with other players and between the species. Even the greatest galactic commander can only secure his or her empire by choosing the right alliance and strategic partners. Joint territorial battles, invasions and annexations are all vital tools for waging war in Imperion. Features such as trade and diplomacy also allow for alternative strategies, however. The endgame encompasses epic battles between alliances as well as a highly-developed alien species, all intended to motivate players in the long term.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imperion also has fantastic graphics with a level of detail that is rarely found in the browser game genre and which bear comparison with any of the classic strategy games. Players will often feel like they are playing an expensive boxed game. Imperion is free, and can be played directly in a browser. For a few dollars, players can also purchase premium functions that provide various advantages within the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
