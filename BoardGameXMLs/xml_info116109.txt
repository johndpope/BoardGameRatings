			<description>Action game for two players, related to Basketball or Netball. Each play at opposite ends of the board. In front of you there is a row of buttons. The board has a number of indentations, into which the ball will settle. When it does, if you press the right button, it will be ejected upward and forward. Of course, your opponent is trying to do the same thing, so speed is essential. There Are 10 Different Pitch Positions to Shoot From and the score is kept by a sliding mechanism on each side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most 'baskets', wins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
