			<description>Positional strategy game originally authored for the Piecepack system where 2-4 players strive to connect a die or pawn orthogonally with a group of exactly five coins (orthogonally connected as well); this group must fulfil an extra condition (two coins matching the suit of the die, three coins matching the suit of the pawn).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setup is the same for all game configurations: two players use two suits each, three players use their own suit and the remaining suit is used by all, four players use a suit each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can in their turn play any coin onto the board, move any coin on the board over free spaces, or move their own die or pawn over free spaces or coins onto a free space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game underwent extensive revision between 2012 and 2013. Some rough edges were smoothed and three new features were added: a procedure for free setups, play on a closed surface and a tactical approach to offering draws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
