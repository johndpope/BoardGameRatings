			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can poor Dan decontaminate the atomic fuel rods in time? In this new 3D machine code game, you control Dan Dan The Atomiser man, jumping from disc to disc, trying to reduce the ever increasing radiation levels in an atomic pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However Up 'n' Atom 'Arry and his gang of vagrant particles are thirsting for the energy in your back pack, which makes life a bit awkward at times. The there's Ron the Rapacious Robot, not the sort to meeting a dark alley (or anywhere else for that matter)!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disco Dan consists of two stages. The first stage consists of running down a tunnel to reach the reactor. The player must avoid enemies and pits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reactor stage is slightly reminiscent of Q*Bert in that you are jumping diagonally between various platforms with an aim to change their colour, while avoiding enemies. The difference is that each platform has a number, which is steadily increasing. Jumping on a platform reduces the number. If a disk is reduced to 0 (green) then it is safe and will no longer increase unless a neighbour explodes or Ron the Robot steps on it. If any of the discs reach the maximum number, they start to flash. If the player doesn't reach it in time it will explode and will then be shown with no number on it. Ron can be shot to remove him from the board for a time. Other roaming enemies (Atoms) can only be moved off one disc onto another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dan has limited energy, which is used every time he moves, fires or touches an enemy. It also steadily decreases over time, representing the power to his Life Support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turning all the discs green awards an extra life, but allowing all to explode results in game over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coding and Design by Daren White &amp;amp; John Line&lt;br/&gt;Tea &amp;amp; sympathy - Sandie &amp;amp; Brenda&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
