			<description>&amp;quot;Ah, the life of a junk dealer.  It always has been a romantic notion.  Of course, the competition is a bit fierce at time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For instance.  You've got a whole load of junk to get rid of, but so do all the other dealers.  And since you all use the same corporate buyer, you've always got to have something different in order to keep his attention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So Load up the truck and get ready to deal before your competitors sell off their whole loads.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--From the front of the envelope&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
