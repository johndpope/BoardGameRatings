			<description>An enjoyable card-board game created after the eponymous novel of a young Czech writer. The game system is based on the adventures during movement in a diversified terrain of old England. In the role of Knights the players have to search for the imprisoned Queen of England and return her to her beloved husband, the grieving King. An original game after an original novel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game the game board is constructed from tiles (initially put face-down) and is revealed throughout the game as Knights move on the tiles. Each tile is divided into 9 segments which are used for the movement and there are 3 Terrain types to be found - Roads, Forests, and Mountains. Each Terrain allows for a different Movement speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Goal of the Knights is to uncover and get to six Castles and find out on which of them the Queen is held (by secretly checking upon a castle card when they enter a Castle, eventually coming to the last card under a small stone, that shows the correct Castle). During their journeys they can use various helpers, for instance Horses, Boats, Eagles or their special versions (awarded from the King for capturing Traitors, that can be found in Taverns).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All-in-all the concept and production quality of the game is fresh and outstanding and is well worth the moderate-to-low price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is language independent, only the manual would have to be translated (currently in Czech only, as of February 2009).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
