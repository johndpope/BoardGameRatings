			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by his experience of once rescuing a tree squirrel, Randy Hecht, an aerospace engineer from Southern California invented this educational board game, and co-founded the company Moxy Roxy, Inc. to pay homage to his furry friend named &amp;ldquo;Roxy.&amp;rdquo; Roxy has built her nests around Randy&amp;rsquo;s backyard, given birth to several litters of babies, and pays him regular visits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take a live journey through the eyes of a tree squirrel. We have all seen these cute creatures in the wild and our backyards, yet few know much about them. Finally, for the first time a board game has been created to simulate the life of a typical tree squirrel from nest born, to adulthood, and ultimately parenthood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full of humanizing and amusing nuances, both children and adults will enjoy many hours of fun and entertainment. With cleverly designed game rules, it also helps kids develop important social, math and negotiation skills that will benefit both their personal and professional lives for years to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general objective of the game is to gather a certain number of food pieces (i.e. acorns, strawberries and pumpkins), as well as obtain five tail rings signifying squirrel life milestone achievements. The first squirrel/player to accomplish this wins.&lt;br/&gt;The minimum number of food pieces that needs to be acquired are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     10 acorns &lt;br/&gt;     10 strawberries &lt;br/&gt;     10 pumpkins &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The milestone achievements that are represented by five tail rings are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     2 nests (2 green tail rings)&lt;br/&gt;     2 litters of babies (2 pink tail rings)&lt;br/&gt;     1 hospital trip (1 yellow tail ring)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generally there is no special order of events except that your squirrel must have at least one nest before having babies. The yellow tail ring signifies that you made at least one hospital trip and proof that you received a rabies vaccination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The food pieces for our Classic Version are made of cardboard, and for our Deluxe Version PVC injection molded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
