			<description>A game with which children can discover the world of visual arts in a playful way, by answering questions and completing art-related tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: 72 picture cards, 91 task tiles, 1 tile bag, 1 sculpture, 24 sculpture parts, 1 learning poster&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets 6 cardboard sculpture parts. The aim of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all their sculpture parts by hanging it onto the tree-shaped sculpture. Players are allowed to hang a sculpture part on the sculpture if they correctly answer a question/complete a task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;24 picture cards with paintings from different eras are put in the middle of the table. On the back of each card there are 3 questions and some general information on the painting and its creator. The task tiles are put in the tile bag. Players take turns drawing a tile from the bag. The active player chooses one of the two tasks and reads it aloud. Now all players try to be the first to complete the task. Tasks include:&lt;br/&gt;- Finding an object (specified on the task tile) on one of the picture cards.&lt;br/&gt;- The active player describes a picture, the other players try to guess which one it is.&lt;br/&gt;- The active player tries to draw one of the pictures, the others guess.&lt;br/&gt;- Players have to answer a question on one of the cards (cards are turned face down).&lt;br/&gt;- Guessing which painting is the oldest or most recent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one of the players has managed to get rid of all his/her sculpture parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
