			<description>from the introduction&lt;br/&gt;In the world of J.R.R. Tolkien&amp;rsquo;s Middle-earth there lies the tranquil and fair land of the Shire. After the events of The Lord of The Rings and the defeat of the Evil Lord Sauron, Peregrin &amp;ldquo;Pippin&amp;rdquo; Took returned home and became instrumental in overthrowing Saruman's forces during the Scouring of the Shire. As he worked to restore his land to its former beauty, Pippin eventually inherited his father's title and became 32nd Thain of the Shire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the help of our guest &amp;ldquo;the Kitchen Overlord&amp;rdquo; (aka Chris Rachael Oseland), the GagMen aimed to create an adventure set during this time period that blended the fun of RPGs with the joys of Shire cooking. In this food themed adventure we have included several recipes for Shire and Middle-earth inspired foods, as well as our traditional wacky story ideas. As always, this adventure was written live on the GagMen RPG Podcast, which you can download and enjoy at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.GagMen.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.GagMen.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure could most certainly be stretched into a full campaign, it was written as a one or two session game, with the intention of being played using Basic Fantasy RPG rules by Chris Gonnerman. But, as is the &amp;ldquo;GagMen Way (trademark pending),&amp;rdquo; we encourage you to be a creative and enthusiastic GM; create new content, throw in your own twist or flair, and polish up any parts of the game where you think we took a wrong step. As the GM, YOU are a co-writer, so make it your own!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
