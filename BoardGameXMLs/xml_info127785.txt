							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Johnny on the Pony</name>
									
			<description>The game is basically a children's race game with no decisions. In this regard it is like Chutes and Ladders. The theme is riding your pony from start to the finish line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a twist on the Chutes and Ladders type game. There are two card decks from which a player may get a move card on his turn. However the player must flip a supplied &amp;quot;coin&amp;quot;  to see if he gets a card from the Johnny stack or the pony stack. having each player flip a coin would thus make &amp;quot;individual&amp;quot; luck come into play as opposed to both players just playing against a randomized deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game had 4 riders and horses. It cam in a cardboard box that was somewhat like a pizza box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
