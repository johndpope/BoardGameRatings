			<description>From the designer;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Age of Man is a civilization building game where each player represents one of the first civilizations to emerge from the Stone age.  Age of Man captures the elements of territorial control, technological development, cultural influence and empire management found in classic civilization games and distills them down to their essence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players lead their civilizations to greatness by expanding control into new regions, building cities, discovering new technology all the while maintaining an ever growing empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to become the greatest civilization of all time and be immortalized in history forever; victory being achieved through a combination Domination(territory control), Diplomacy(cities all over the world) or Assimilation(empire size).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features modular boards, variable paths to victory and multiple victory conditions create a dynamic gaming experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
