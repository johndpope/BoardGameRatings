			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Secret of the Slavers Stockade&amp;rdquo; was published by TSR in 1981. This 32-page booklet had an outer folder containing maps. It was written by Harold Johnson and Tom Moldvay. The cover artwork by Jim Roslof features a drawing of two hobgoblins, a boggle on a leash, and a party of adventurers. The interior art was done by Roslof, Dee, Willingham, and Erol Otus. The adventure leads to a lost fortress where slaves are being kept and fattened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was originally designed as a tournament module, rewarding players for what they accomplished in addition to how long they survived. It became part of the &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; series adventures &amp;ldquo;Scourge of the Slavelords&amp;rdquo; and is ranked #20 in Dragon Magazine&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The 30 Greatest D&amp;amp;D Adventures of All Time&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conversion guide allows DMs to run the original module with 5th Edition rules and provides reference sheets for encounters, magic items, traps and creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To use this conversion guide you will need a copy of A2: Secret of the Slavers Stockade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 12+ hour adventure for 4th&amp;ndash;7th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
