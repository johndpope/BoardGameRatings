			<description>A very unusual offering from Pepys. They were commisioned by the Observer Corps as an aid to help sevicemen to recognise different aircraft. There were two sets printed, one with 52 cards and a joker with silhouettes of aircraft and the cards marked with R, O, B, G (to stand for Red, Orange, Blue and Green suits). The second set was still 52 cards plus a joker but this used photographs of aircraft. &lt;br/&gt;Pepys saw a marketing advantage and printed rules to use the cards as a game.&lt;br/&gt;The games suggested were: Pelmanism, Snap, Banker, Happy Families, Rummy, and Clock Patience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
