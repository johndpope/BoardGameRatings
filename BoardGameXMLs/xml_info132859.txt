			<description>A trading game, where the players buy and sell houses and bungalows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, a random number of houses and bungalows is auctioned amongst the players in a Dutch auction. The players then select their selling price, and a random roll on the market value track determines which properties sell and which don't. Players also have to manage their land blocks to build the property on, which costs money each round. Once someone completes five blocks, the game ends and the player with the most valuable property wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
