							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yahtzee Bowling</name>
									
			<description>Instead of dice, this game uses five bowling pins with the numbers 1 through 6 on its hexagon sides.  Two players or teams take turns rolling the ball at the pins.  As in standard Yahtzee, you can hold pins after your first roll to try to get the best combination possible in rolls two and three.  The highest combination between the players or teams wins.  No other score is kept.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was given as a Wendy's kids meal promotional item and is based on one of the games featured on Hub TV's &amp;quot;Family Game Night&amp;quot; game show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
