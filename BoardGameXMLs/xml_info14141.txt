			<description>(description from publisher's website) &amp;quot;Under the surface of a peaceful society, legend persists about people called Gangsters and the glamorous lifestyle they lead.&lt;br/&gt;These Gangsters used hits to protect their interests, and it is said that the best contract hitters worked for Termination Incorporated.&lt;br/&gt;To satisfy the people's need for combat, the controlling Council devised a tournament to be held in vast stadiums in front of thousands of ecstatic, yelling fans.&lt;br/&gt;Here combatants use stealth, courage and tactical awareness to out manoeuvre and attack their opponents, scoring points with their Electric Pulse Discharge Guns, then making their escape using the hard laser walls as cover.&lt;br/&gt;Many tried and failed, but eventually the very best of the very best were able to compete for the trophy called Termination Incorporated.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use movement cards to travel across a maze-like board and shoot your opponents before they shoot you.  Dice are used to determine damage depending upon your distance away (with a couple of &amp;quot;auto-result&amp;quot; cards that can be used.)  You have limited ammo and need to reload at specific squares. There's a minor card bluffing element (you can shield yourself for a turn but you might be bluffing.)  There is a single sheet ruleset which explains what all the bits do but leaves you to infer how the game itself works.&lt;br/&gt;The production values are reasonably high, but all the cards and the board are in monochrome.&lt;br/&gt;Basically, it's like Frag but without the interesting weapons or objects or slight role-playing element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
