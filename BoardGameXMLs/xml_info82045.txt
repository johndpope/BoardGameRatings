			<description>Disney Epic Mickey (also known as Super Secret Warren Spector Game Project or Junction Point Studios Project #2) is an upcoming Mickey Mouse video game designed by Warren Spector, with 2D cinemas by Powerhouse Animation Studios, Inc. and developed by Junction Point Studios for the Wii console, using Emergent Game Technologies' Gamebryo Engine. Epic Mickey is part of an effort by The Walt Disney Company to re-brand the Mickey Mouse character by moving away from his current squeaky clean image and reintroducing the mischievous side of his personality. Spector has been collaborating with Walt Disney Feature Animation and Pixar in conjunction with the project. The November edition of Game Informer confirmed Epic Mickey's existence. The game was officially announced on October 28, 2009 in London.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A long time ago, Walt Disney, represented in the game by the sorcerer Yen Sid, created a pen-and-paper world (based on his &amp;quot;Disneyland&amp;quot; theme parks) for his forgotten and rejected creations (mentioned as &amp;quot;a world for things that have been forgotten&amp;quot;). This world appeared as an intricate model on a table in Yen Sid's study, which is accessible through a mirror. Mickey, who finds himself inside Yen Sid's study by entering a mirror in his house, sees the model, and waits until Yen Sid is gone before going back to take another look at it. Fiddling with it, Mickey tries to create a model of himself but instead creates the Phantom Blot. Panicking, Mickey quickly erases it by throwing paint thinner onto it and soaking it up with a sponge, accidentally spilling paint onto the model in the process. Hearing Yen Sid approaching, Mickey quickly tries to clean up with the sponge (again accidentally spilling the thinner onto the model in the process) and flees back to his home. However, it's too late-the world Yen Sid created is ravaged; a wasteland. The Phantom Blot (with the thinner at his disposal) takes control of the ruined lands from its first resident-and Mickey's older half-brother-Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Oswald and the other residents of the Wasteland fight against the Phantom Blot, but he eventually overwhelms them and twists their world into a dark and sinister version of itself, forcing Oswald into hiding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Years later, Mickey has forgotten his past transgression until the Phantom Blot enters his home through the mirror and pulls him into the Cartoon Wasteland. Oswald, his will lost from years of hiding and his mind twisted by his jealousy of Mickey's rise to fame, has formulated a plan to destroy Mickey. In addition, The Mad Doctor works closely with the Blot, creating &amp;quot;Beetleworx&amp;quot;-robotic creatures made from parts of various Disney cartoon characters (for example, the Beetleworx Cannon robots have the head of Hades). He also creates animatronic &amp;quot;buddies&amp;quot; for Oswald, looking like decrepit robotic versions of Mickey's friends, as Oswald wants Mickey's life and popularity for himself. Armed with a magical paintbrush that he managed to pull into the world with him, Mickey must stop the Phantom Blot, gain Oswald's trust and save the Wasteland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Epic Mickey&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
