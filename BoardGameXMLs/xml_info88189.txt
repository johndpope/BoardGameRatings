			<description>In Crazy Climber the player assumes the role of a daredevil who is attempting to climb to the top of four skyscrapers. There are a number of obstacles and dangers to avoid including:&lt;br/&gt;Windows that open and close (the most common danger). &lt;br/&gt;Bald-headed residents (aka Mad Doctor), who throws objects such as flower pots, buckets of water and fruit in an effort to knock the climber off the building (with larger objects appearing by more aggressive Mad Doctors in later levels). &lt;br/&gt;A giant condor, who drops eggs and excrement aimed at the climber (two at a time in the early stages, as many as six or eight in later levels). &lt;br/&gt;A giant ape (styled like King Kong), whose punch can prove deadly (he becomes more aggressive in later levels).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Crazy Climber,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
