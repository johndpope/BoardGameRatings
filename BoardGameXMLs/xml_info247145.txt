							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flick A&#039; Round: Zombie Road</name>
									
			<description>A small band of desperate survivors lies on the brink of annihilation.  In Flick A&amp;rsquo; Round: Zombie Road, Players flick their wooden playing pieces around the table in search of supplies needed to build a safe camp.  Find all six of the supply cards needed to complete the camp and get back inside safely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Work together, but keep your distance.  Because in this game, any one of the players could have been bitten on their search for supplies.  Once revealed, the zombie player immediately begins his new goal of stopping the survivors from winning by turning them all into zombies before they can complete the camp and get back safely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
