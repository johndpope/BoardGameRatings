			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Blakros family, long an ally of the Pathfinder Society, has come into possession of a manor house in the imperial nation of Cheliax, where a once prominent noble family was known to practice diabolism before the Age of Lost Omens. The Pathfinders' task is simple: clear the abandoned manor of any remaining threats before the Blakroses move in. Unfortunately, the estate hasn't sat empty as long as the Blakroses think it has, and its recent inhabitants were anything but the devil-worshipers who originally built the manor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Day of the Demon&amp;quot; is an exclusive adventure to be run only by 4-star Pathfinder Society GMs, Venture-Captain and Venture-Lieutenant campaign volunteers, and Paizo staff for its first year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 3&amp;ndash;7 (Tier 3&amp;ndash;7; Subtiers 3&amp;ndash;4 and 6&amp;ndash;7).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is designed for play in Pathfinder Society Organized Play, but can easily be adapted for use with any world. This scenario is compliant with the Open Game License (OGL) and is suitable for use with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
