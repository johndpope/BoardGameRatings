			<description>From the publisher: &lt;br/&gt;This character education game teaches students how a real business works, as well as how employees directly contribute to the success or failure of the business. As the game progresses, profits and sales are affected by the behavior of employees under realistic business conditions. Students will recognize exactly which behaviors employers value in their employees. A fun game that reinforces good employee behavior and introduces common business terms. Includes teacher's booklet and reproducible score sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
