			<description>Auktionsspelet (&amp;quot;The Auction Game&amp;quot;) from Swedish publisher Aristospel is a WWII era game in which the players is given some money and then participates in an auction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the most numbers of complete sets of bought items. The auction items is a deck of cards. The game also includes rules, money and a small, very handsome, auctioneer's gavel. All in a small box, that together with the old Aristospel logotype and the absence of expensive or complicated components, makes it fairly easy to date the game to the war years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer and artist is, sadly, not known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
