							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Towers of Rexor</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an apprentice bard with both mystical powers and musical skills, you have been taught swordplay like other boys your age. But now that you have been assigned to King Baldin's court, perhaps you will add battle training to your other accomplishments. Yet with or without warrior skills, when the king's daughter Thaya is stolen by the powerful wizard Rexor, you know you must take up the quest to free her from the dreaded wizard's towers- legendary strongholds said to be filled with horrifying monsters and treasure beyond imagining. What will you find when you venture into the ruby and emerald towers? The beautiful princess herself, magical beasts that only the bravest- or cleverest- can conquer, or gold enough to temp your very soul? The dangers are great but the rewards are too. Will you fall victim to hidden traps and perils or choose wisely and find fame and fortune?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
