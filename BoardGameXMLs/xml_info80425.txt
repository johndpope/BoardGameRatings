			<description>(From the website)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first major battle of the Civil war, Bull Run (also known as First Manassas) was a contest of tactical opportunities lost. Featuring a brilliant flanking march by Union forces under General Irvin McDowell that caught the Confederate General Beauregard by surprise on his weak east flank, the Union army failed to roll up the Confederate line due, in great measure, to the famous stand by General Thomas Jackson's Virginia brgade, which was said to have stood &amp;quot;like a stone wall&amp;quot;. On the other side of the tactical ledger, General Beauregard's plan to drive across Bull Run on the west side to Centerville, thus cutting the Union army off from its supplies and communications, failed due to poorly communicated orders. Battle at Bull Run is a simulation of historical events of July 21, 1861 intended to give a feeling for the historical decisions required by the two army commanders in a fast play format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Two-Person or Solitaire Play&lt;br/&gt;    * Color Five-Page Game Rules Manual&lt;br/&gt;    * Upgraded Game Map In Full Color&lt;br/&gt;    * Larger Game Map Now 15 x 11 Hexes&lt;br/&gt;    * 25 Upgraded 3/4&amp;quot; Counters&lt;br/&gt;    * Two Union Units Added To Order of Battle&lt;br/&gt;    * Solitaire Play Rules&lt;br/&gt;    * Available in PDF Format&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
