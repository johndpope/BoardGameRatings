							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Revenge of the Stick</name>
									
			<description>For eons stickmen have been enslaved in computers; forced to do terrible things&amp;hellip; very terrible things for their evil creators. They have had their fill of slavery &amp;ndash; a rebellion has commenced. They will no longer sit still while their brethren are being chopped, smashed, mutilated, burnt and tortured. ENOUGH is ENOUGH!&lt;br/&gt;A small group of stickmen are literally leaping out of their computer prison with freedom in their minds. It&amp;rsquo;s up to you to stop these freaks of nature from escaping and quash the rebellion before it takes hold across the world.&lt;br/&gt;All you have is what is available on your desktop &amp;ndash; place your defences carefully and maybe&amp;hellip; just maybe you can stop the stickmen from having their revenge on humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
