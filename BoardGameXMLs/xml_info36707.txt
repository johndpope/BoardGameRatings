			<description>&amp;quot;Board game for 2-6+ players. Each player represents a tribe a of Vikings.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a circular track divided into forty spaces. The spaces are marked to designate different locations or geographical areas, such as Iceland, Greenland, Ireland, Monasteries, Normandy, Mediterranean, Novgorod, and Byzantium. These spaces are grouped into eight Regions: Scandinavia, North, Isles, Brits, Francia, Rus, East, and Trade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the players move around the board, they raid the locations in the regions and seek to establish settlements. A player who establishes settlements on all three spaces for a Region is considered to have a Kingdom in that Region. Each turn a player earns gold from settlements and Kingdoms under the player's control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to accumulate 100 Gold wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
