			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the Final Battle Before the End of the World (#4)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History records that one of the most evil men to ever walk planet Earth, Adolf Hitler, took his own life on April 30, 1945. But the facts surrounding his death have long been questioned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the grand tradition of The Death of Osama bin Laden and Icing Oetzi, NUELOW Games proudly presents another Historical Recreation that educates while entertaining by shedding light on a pivotal historical event with facts as they were found in top-secret government files and the personal diary of Chuck Norris.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement for ROLF!: The Rollplaying Game of Big Dumb Fighters features several Combat Maneuvers and Traits not found in the core rulebook, as well as full game statistics for Adolf Hitler and the four people who sealed his fate: Baroness Blood, Captain Nazi, Chuck Norris, and Jon, the Most Interesting Man in the World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ROLF!: The Death of Adolf Hitler is another Final Battle from NUELOW Games, as we count down to the End of the World that was predicted by ancient Mayans for 2012. This may be the last game scenario you ever play, so get don't wait until tomorrow to buy it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
