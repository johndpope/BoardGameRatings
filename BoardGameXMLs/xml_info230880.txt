			<description>A new type of Fantasy Football is here!&lt;br/&gt;​&lt;br/&gt;Watch football and play Feetball, predicting what will happen each play using Feetball Cards and the game board.  Out-gain and out-score your opponents, advancing your Feetball team down the field with every play you call.  Pick up Audible Cards along the way to shake things up like steal cards, double yards, play multiple cards, sack your opponent, swap field position, and more.&lt;br/&gt;​&lt;br/&gt;There's no such thing as garbage time anymore.  No matter what football game is on TV, there is an intense and competitive Feetball game waiting to happen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
