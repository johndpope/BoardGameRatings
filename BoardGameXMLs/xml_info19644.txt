			<description>A Mennonite Central Committee (MCC) Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heart of the game is answering trivia about the MCC and its activities.  Many of the answers are found in the information sheets included with the game.  &amp;ldquo;The game was to be educational, fun to play and might even raise some dollars for MCC.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global Neighbors is played on a board of the world.  At the start of the game, information sheets are divided amongst the players and each player is given responsibility for several different countries.  In order to win, you must be the first to visit each of the countries you are responsible for.  You move along the board by successfully answering trivia questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you must answer a question from one of the Question Cards.  Each Card has four different numbers on it.  If you answer the question correctly, you can move your marker a number of spaces equal to any one of the numbers on the card.  If you fail to answer a question, you cannot move and you must share some information from one of your Information Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;-    Mounted Game Board&lt;br/&gt;-    Location Tiles (one for each country on the game board)&lt;br/&gt;-    Player Markers (6)&lt;br/&gt;-    Information Sheets (25)&lt;br/&gt;-    Question Cards (270, double-sided)&lt;br/&gt;-    Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
