							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Adventure Pack One</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout this adventure pack you will find some similarities: all adventures include text in italics which may be read aloud to the players or paraphrased as you wish, all monsters stat blocks will be in the same format as in the basic Challenger book, and all dungeons will be listed in terms of encounter numbers which can be placed on your own personally-created dungeon as you wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To use this book properly you will need a copy of the basic Challenger role-playing game which is available for free complete in the sample in many places across the internet. Even if you don't have this product, you can easily adapt any system you're using to suit these adventures, especially the Of Mice Men and Wizards game system which works particularly well with these quests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure pack contains 7 complete adventures for use with your Challenger roleplaying game system designed to get you started and take a band of 1st level heroes all the way to 100th level and beyond. This is somewhat an exaggerated xp gain ratio, but it should serve to illustrate the games mechanics to new players and get you started on creating your own epic campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
