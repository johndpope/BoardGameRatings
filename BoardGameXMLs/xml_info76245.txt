							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gratuitous Space Battles: The Swarm</name>
									
			<description>From Official Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Swarm is the latest species in the universe of Gratuitous Space Battles. The swarm will destroy you, but it's nothing personal. They are just doing what comes natural to them, moving ever-forwards, ever onwards, always spreading throughout the galaxy, consuming, destroying, fighting. There can be no negotiation, no surrender, no peace with the swarm. They are like a virus spreading rapidly through our galaxy, armed with a bucketload of lasers and disruptor beams. Flee while you still can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What The Swarm Expansion Pack Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10 New ships. 4 Cruisers 3 Frigates and 3 fighters, all in a new graphical style by the same artist who did the original GSB artwork. The swarm ships are a blend of hotrod sports cars, egyptian pharoahs and samurai warriors. With feathers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 New ship equipment:  The swarm have disruptor beams, a slow firing beam laser that concentrates the power of several hardpoints together to generate an unusually destructive blast that tears through strong shields. This is a graphical effect, and the weapon will work in any turret. The Swarm also have 'nest' crew module for frigates, meaning you can cram more crew into a smaller space. They also have 'smart bombs' which detonate all incoming (and outgoing) missiles within their radius, fighter fusion guns and micro-target boosters for fighters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New ship bonuses. The swarm ships are built on the cheap. They fall to bits easily and aren't very good at making shields or armor, but they do churn out those puppies at bargain prices. Swarm fleets will have large waves of ships, overwhelming the enemy by weight of numbers and speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 New Scenarios. Two maps for you to fight against the swarm, and to use in online challenges. Specially designed space nebulae to show off the shiny new golden hues of the swarm!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
