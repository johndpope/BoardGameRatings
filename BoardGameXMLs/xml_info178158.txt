			<description>Maneuvers is an abstract naval strategy game published in 1942.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a grid of 11 by 14 interconnected squares representing naval bases. Each player controls 33 tokens representing battleships, submarines, and aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns placing ships or planes on the naval bases; when a row of five identical tokens has been created the player wins a victory. Depending on the type of sequence created the victorious player may remove certain combinations of enemy units from the grid. For example, if a submarine pattern has been formed a player may decide to remove two enemy battleships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to lose seven tokens in any two categories is considered to be incapable of continuing the struggle. The other player is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game is designed for two players optional rules permit three or four to enjoy a session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
