			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I choose YOU, Pikathulhu!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're 10 years old. You're our last hope. Armed with a shining Dodecahedron and the elder incantations to make it work, you capture the monsters and train them to use their power&amp;hellip; But not for evil. For sport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is not dead which can eternal lie,&lt;br/&gt;and with strange aeons even death may die!&lt;br/&gt;To bring down our masters on an icy night,&lt;br/&gt;And to claim the power when the stars are right&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;Derleth!&lt;br/&gt;Bloch!&lt;br/&gt;Team Eibon!&lt;br/&gt;Stand fast to resist our rage&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;Or flee to the safety of a new dark age!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ftaghn! That's Right!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amid the sagging gables of Old New England, evil lurks&amp;hellip;and squirms, and scuttles, and purrs. Grownups are fleeing in terror, hiding behind the Elder Sign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've thrilled to the popular TV show. Now, you can play the game! Is your Shoplifting score good enough to sneak a page from your opponent's Pok&amp;eacute;nomicon? Is your trained Jigglypolyp powerful enough to defeat a devolved Fungal Cluster? This is the world of POKETHULHU, and now it's yours to save&amp;mdash;or conquer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast furious and more fun than a screaming yellow electric rat in a blender, the stars are SO right for this hilarious game of cute, cuddly cultists and seizure-inducing evil!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
