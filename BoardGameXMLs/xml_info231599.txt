							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Truly Terrifying Vampires</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vampire - the quintessential horror of the night.  Yet, all too often such fiends are downgraded to simple and forgettable monsters, often easily defeated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But not tonight.  Tonight, you will learn who a vampire really is, and just how terrifying they can be...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quite simply, typical vampires are laughable lightweights.  They're a dime-a-dozen, chich&amp;eacute;, and severely troped.  Today, they're just not scary, and they're no longer seen as the truly terrifying monsters they once were.  With vampires having been watered down so heavily, how can any game master hope to give their players a morally interesting and frightening challenge?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By going back to what made them scary in the first place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Truly Terrifying Vampires, you'll see the difference between boring vampires of today and the vampires of past (who truly instilled fear in others).  Through options and tables, you'll be able to build your vampire into a monster that your players will both always fear and never forget.  There are a few sample vampire builds (with character backgrounds), and you'll also find several horror adventure hooks to inspire your sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an ANY RPG product, the concepts in this book can be applied to any game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
