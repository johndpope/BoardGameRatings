							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">THE STRANGE: Cypher Chest</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created as game aids to easily randomize and track transient items, The Strange Cypher Deck, XP Deck, and Creature Deck are among the best-selling PDF products for the line. Now they're available through retail, in a single well-priced, easy-to-shelf package! The three decks come in a sturdy rigid box, sized to sit neatly alongside The Strange books on your RPG shelves. The internal tray holds the three existing decks, with room to store future expansions. The Cypher Deck allows GMs and players to randomly generate single-use cyphers on the fly. Each of the 100 power cards offers multiple power options, while 20 form cards describe the item's appearance in each of six possible recursion laws. The XP Deck provides a set of tangible tokens to represent experience points-a sort of game currency that often changes hands between players. The Creature Deck contains 100 commonly encountered creatures. Draw a card to quickly build an encounter: One side has basic stats (with a reference to the book for full stats and info), and the reverse has an image to share with the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
