			<description>NyaHaX'93 is clear how much of the stage in 3 minutes, compete with or be acquired how much score, a time trial shooting game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead there is no limit to the stock of its own equipment, penalty to receive the enemy of the bullets hit the &amp;quot;remaining time is reduced 10 seconds&amp;quot;, two points of &amp;quot;stage again.&amp;quot; Until anyway went 3 minutes, you can continue the game even if no matter what. Also the automatic fire mode is available, happy friendly design for beginners. Fairy-tale enemy characters and nimble BGM also, to have helped to soften the atmosphere of the prone shooting game becomes tasteless, it's a fun play 1 installment even without a shooting mania&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
