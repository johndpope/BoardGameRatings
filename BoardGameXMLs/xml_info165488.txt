For sixteen years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been living in dirt and take it from me&amp;hellip; some of it&amp;rsquo;s bound to run off on you. You get to hate people; everyone you meet.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;&amp;ndash; Shield for Murder (1954)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Big Crime is a roleplaying game that faithfully and meticulously emulates the bleak, shadow-drenched crime thrillers of the 1940s and &amp;lsquo;50s &amp;ndash; Out of the Past, The Asphalt Jungle, Double Indemnity, The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep and hundreds more!
