			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knights of Camelot is a card-based tabletop rpg. Other rpgs like Dungeons and Dragons have all the expensive books and materials that you need to have to play. Not KOC. When I was thinking of an rpg to create I thought to myself, what games do I like? Well KOC might not be a super famous rpg like D&amp;amp;D, but it is still an awesome adventure that you can get with only a few bucks. It may be cheap to buy, but it is not cheaply made. I have devoted endless hours thinking about the features of this game. Well, I hope you enjoy this majestic game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
