							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vainglory</name>
									
			<description>Vainglory is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game by Super Evil Megacorp for iOS. Designed for mobile platforms, it is a simplified version of the PC-based genre wherein two opposing teams of three players fight to destroy the enemy base by controlling the path between the bases, which is lined by turrets and guarded by enemy minions. Off the path, players battle for control points that supply extra resources. The game was released on November 16, 2014, after being soft-launched for over half a year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Vainglory, teams have three players and each controls an avatar, known as a &amp;quot;hero&amp;quot;, from their own device. Computer-controlled minions, known as &amp;quot;creeps&amp;quot;, spawn at team bases and follow the lane to the opposite team's base, fighting enemies en route. Lining the lanes are turret towers that repel the flow creeps and enemy heroes. The player's objective is to gain experience and gold currency by fighting off enemy creeps, towers, and other players, en route to destroy the crystalline Vain objective in the enemy's base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Vainglory (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
