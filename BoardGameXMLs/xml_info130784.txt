			<description>Tactical level wargame based on the anime series Mobile Suit Z Gundam. The game focuses on small troop tactics of the mobile suits in combat. This game is an updated version of Gundam 0080 Cyclops Attack, with updated rules and units from UC 0087.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control sixty-foot tall (or larger) armored troops called mobile suits.&lt;br/&gt;Each counter represents an individual mobile suit. Data cards explain different units and their corresponding abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players secretly select the tactics they will employ per platoon, and then units alternately activate by platoon. Most tactics deal with movement or combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of the battle is determined by destruction of opponent mobile suits.&lt;br/&gt;The game include some scenarios from Zeta Gundam, but main part of this game is a campaign game, with the player's having the ability to build and customize troops sent into combat. In campaign game, players also manage their own pilots in addition to the mobile suits. The pilots abilities can grow through combat experience. Points scored in battle allow for replacement of older and weaker mobile suits by newer models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
