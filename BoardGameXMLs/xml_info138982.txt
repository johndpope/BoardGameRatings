			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hero's Duty is a 3D on-rails shooter released in 2012 as part of Disney's promotion of &amp;quot;Wreck-It Ralph&amp;quot;, a film which ostensibly takes place inside this arcade game and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a cursor onscreen using the mouse. Clicking the left button fires the player's weapon. The user plays the part of a futuristic Space Marine fighting to save humanity from an invasion of &amp;quot;Cy-bugs&amp;quot;, under the direction of Sergeant Calhoun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can shoot ammo to keep their gun charged, health packs to replenish lost health and can recieve other power-ups, including extra weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has two modes, a Story Mode where several rooms need to be cleared one after another, and a Survival Mode where many waves of Cy-bugs attack the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It should be noted that Disney released a game of the same name on mobile platforms as part of a Wreck-It Ralph compilation app, which is very different. The mobile version is a top-down dual-stick shooter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
