			<description>Limn is a balderdash style party game for four to ten players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a few pages from newspapers and/or magazines and clips words or phrases that could describe each one of the other players from these papers.  When everyone has chosen phrases for all the players, the clippings are randomized and the players guess who clipped the phrases and who is being described.  Players score points for correct guesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
