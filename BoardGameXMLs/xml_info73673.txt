							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bedlam City Basics</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take a trip back to the Iron Age of comics and visit Bedlam City. It&amp;rsquo;s the smaller, dirtier and more dangerous town next door to your campaign&amp;rsquo;s shining metropolis, presented here in lavish detail. This giant-sized book is crammed with dozens of NPCs, neighborhoods, adventure seeds and locations, with enough back-stories and plot arcs to keep your PCs playing for years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We know that the grim and sordid &amp;quot;Iron Age&amp;quot; of comics isn&amp;rsquo;t everyone&amp;rsquo;s cup of filth, so even though Bedlam will support an extended campaign, we&amp;rsquo;ve designed it to fit seamlessly into nearly any superhero game world, as a place your heroes can go to have darker, grubbier adventures for a change of pace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So buckle on your body armor, clench your cigar between your stubbly jaws and set your clock back to an age of iron. Fight the Mafia on the gloomy streets of Stark Hill. Battle the gangs in Wolverton. Face down the sinister cult called the Mara in the back alleys of Hardwick Park. Walk the toxic, deserted streets of the Country Club and see what has taken up residence there, or go to war with the secret overlords of Greely Point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what are you waiting for? Bedlam is calling. There&amp;rsquo;s a shadowy, trash-strewn rooftop out there somewhere with your name on it...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
