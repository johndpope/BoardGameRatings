			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Sidotta Rimice was a child in the Italian countryside during the second world war. She and her parents hid in a barn, when fighters were flying overhead; a dropped bomb set fire to the barn and its hay. Her parents were killed in that barn, and her legs were crushed under a falling beam. For the next four days, she passed in and out of hallucinations, she lost blood, went hungry, cannibalized her parents' corpses, while waiting for rescue. She went insane, a little bit. Her rescuers found her, a little mad crippled girl, sated from the raw meat her parents' dead bodies offered. In blood-her own blood, her parents' blood, and many other people's blood-she had drawn symbols over the beam that pinned her to the ground. These were the maps of hell, pathetic blasphemies in the eyes of some, powerful occult lore to others. These were the maps of hell, never published before, until now. Today, on the tenth anniversary of the day Sidotta Rimice was vivisected by Satanists, who wanted to study her brain for hell's secrets. It is in the memory of a sad life, a mad life, that we now publish Sidotta Rimice's seminal Maps of Hell.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
