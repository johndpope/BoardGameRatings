							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elmo&#039;s Zoo Ride</name>
									
			<description>Very simple spin and move game. Players have little Choo Choo Train pieces that move along a track through a zoo. Spaces are divided into (four) colours and Zoo Gates. If a player lands on a Zoo Gate, he or she draws an Animal Card. There are 32 cards with eight types of animal, but which animals a player has (or how many of each) has no effect on the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player that has the most Animal Cards once all players have reached the end (back at Sesame Street) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
