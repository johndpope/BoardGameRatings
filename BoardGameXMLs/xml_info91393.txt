			<description>Hamurabi is a text-based game of land and resource management and is one of the earliest computer games. Its name is a shortening of Hammurabi, reduced to fit an eight-character limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doug Dyment wrote The Sumer Game in 1968 as a demonstration program for the FOCAL programming language, programming it on a DEC PDP-8. The game has often been inaccurately attributed to Richard Merrill, the designer of FOCAL. Once a version of BASIC was released for the PDP-8, David H. Ahl ported it to BASIC. The game spread beyond mainframes when Ahl published an expanded version of it in BASIC Computer Games, the first best-selling computer book. The expanded version was renamed Hamurabi [sic] and added an end-of-game performance appraisal. This version was then ported to many different microcomputers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like many BASIC games of the time, Hamurabi was mainly a game of numeric input. As the ruler, the player could buy and sell land, purchase grain and decide how much grain to release to his kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end-game appraisal compared the player to historical rulers (e.g., &amp;quot;Your heavy-handed performance smacks of Nero and Ivan IV.&amp;quot;), a tradition carried on by many contemporary strategy games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Hamurabi,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
