			<description>Hoodwinked is a children's game with a mix of puzzles and challenges that the player must complete while the world is upside-down. You wear a pair of goggles with a mirror pointing down at 45 degrees, so your view of the world is inverted. The game has a deck of cards showing tasks, such as word puzzles, drawing puzzles and building with little wooden blocks. The quarter-board shows a crazy room and you progress from task to task until you reach to the finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
