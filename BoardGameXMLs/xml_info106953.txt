			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adventurer's Guide To Terrath LITE Edition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is an age of exploration and adventure. Religious sects, political groups and wealthy merchant guilds struggle against one another to gain power, wealth and influence in the Free City-States. Meanwhile, caravans and expeditions leave daily to reclaim the shattered and deadly lands of Terrath. Will you band together with these brave souls on their journeys or will you strive to join the ranks of such elite groups as The Bearers of Aegis or Keepers of the Secret Flame? Or will you find your own path to greatness? Everyone has a destiny. Where will yours take you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally - the wait is over. The Shroud of the Ancients Role Playing Game (SOTARPG), powered by the D5 System, utilizes a tiered magic system for flexibility and creativity. It is a classless, levelless, skill driven rules set that doesn't constrain your character with limitations and restrictions. The Shroud of the Ancients Role Playing Game brings to life a realistic fantasy world where heroes, armed with cold steel, quick wits and formidable magic, vie for power against the enemies of the innocent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the awesome Revised LITE version of the Shroud of the Ancients Role Playing Game, you can generate a character (including buying distinctions and skills), cast spells, attack and maneuver, plus learn about the gods of Terrath and the basics of advancement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
