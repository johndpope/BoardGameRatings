			<description>This is a card game in which everyone wins except for one person---the Dingus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea is to dump the amout of cards you have in your hand by spelling DINGUS on other players score piles. When someone runs out of cards the game is over and the person with the most amount of letters (some cards have 2 letters) is the DINGUS, and THAT is a very bad thing. Very bad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
