			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cry havoc! Let slip five new breeds of dog in this supplement from Little Red Goblin Games! From the elven fey hound to the orcish mastiff, new companions for your characters come to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game! Also being introduced is the dog handler; a class specialized in the use of these canine companions to bring out their full potential!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bond between man and dog has stretched back farther than our recorded history. Dogs can be used for many different tasks, and we wanted to help bring that idea alive in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. The dog breeds can be used to model a wide variety of canines, from the normal to the fantastic. They can prove to be as challenging foes as they are useful allies, and with the dog handler class, you can ensure that your companion will stay relevant through any level of play. So, all that we're saying is: Give dogs a chance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
