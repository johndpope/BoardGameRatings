			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While planning ahead for each gaming session is critical, often times players do something unexpected. This can leave DMs struggling for quality material on a moment's notice. It is for this season the Common Ground series was created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why would you need to use this book? Your players have taken an unexpected detour and you need a quick encounter for them (create a small inn). The party decides to seek clerical services from a second or third temple found within the town because they suspect the main church to have a spy (create a medium good church). After defeating a small band of orcs, the PCs are looking for a way to replenish their supplies without going all the way back to town (create a tiny merchant tent).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This unique generation system will allow a DM to have a fully detailed map of the church, inn, or merchant; stock it with fully equipped NPCs of any race or alignment; have domain and spell information for all NPCs, and merchandise for stores - all in under five minutes in a handy reference sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
