							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pike Attack</name>
									
			<description>It was another fishing game, `Pike Attack' which was the the most promising new game on display at the &amp;quot;Death Row&amp;quot; at the London Toys Fair of 1994. &lt;br/&gt;The aim of Pike Attack is to collect and keep a full set of five fishing tackle cards, which are laid face up on the board. &lt;br/&gt;A full set of tackle allows a player to fish, with the object of landing the heaviest catch. If the player holds a bite card, then the player is able to take a fish card. If the player's tackle matches the ratings for both line and hook, as shown on the fish card, then the player lands the fish. &lt;br/&gt;However, if only one of the ratings match, the player must throw the `fight dice'. The throw determines whether the fish is caught, gets away, or whether a penalty is suffered, such as loosing your hook or breaking your line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lurking amongst the normal fish is the Pike. If a player draws the pike card then it is possible to catch the pike if a Pike Buster card is held, otherwise you are likely to lose either part of your tackle or part of your previous catch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has been sponsored by Shimano, a fishing tackle company, but the inclusion of their logo in the computer generated graphics is very discrete and does not distract from the appearance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very appealing game components make a good and light family game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
