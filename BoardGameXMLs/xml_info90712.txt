							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tron: Evolution â€“ Battle Grids</name>
									
			<description>Create your own program as you battle and defeat enemies in Tron: Evolution - Battle Grids. This version of Tron: Evolution also allows players to move around the world of Tron in Grid Tanks, Light Cycles, Light Runners or just hand-to-hand combat. In story mode you go through many games and some small hubs. In each hub there are programs with jobs, or quests that you can complete for bits (also you can find bits scattered around the hubs). There is a cheat code system for unlocking in-game elements. You can play with three other players at the same time in local multiplayer (there is no online mode).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tron: Evolution - Battle Grids&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
