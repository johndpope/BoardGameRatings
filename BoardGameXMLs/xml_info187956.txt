							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SOL Lite</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the years, there have been a number of RPGs that have been labeled as Generic, Universal, Multi-Genre, or Customizable.  The goals of these systems are to allow players to adventure in any number of worlds and still make use of the same core of rules.  However, the often fall short of the ultimate goal - to be playable in any setting without having to make changes in the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Omniversal Roleplaying system would allow you to play anything from gods to viruses.  Bug-eyed aliens would be able to play alongside fantasy wizards and use exactly the same rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SOL Lite is a cut-down version of the complete SOL rules.  Everything is here that will allow you to play in modern or even historical settings.  We have even included templates from our Outsider Chronicles series.  It is free for your own personal use and to share with your friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hope you enjoy the ride.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
