			<description>Players must get from the Start space, lower left of the board, to the Finish space, lower right of the board. To move, a player spins the spinner and moves to the next space with the same colour that he has just spun. Then he draws a card and obeys the instruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you land on the space next to the cross-bar (The track is a large letter A, so has to have a cross-bar). This is a short cut but if taken, the player does not use the spinner. In this case, he moves one space at a time until he is out of the short-cut. Of course, after each move of one space, he must still draw a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first to reach the Finish space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
