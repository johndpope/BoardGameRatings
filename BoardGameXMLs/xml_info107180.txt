							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Argyle &amp; Crew: Adventures in the Land of Skcos</name>
									
			<description>designer summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Argyle &amp;amp; Crew is a free wheeling system powered by imagination. Rather than a character sheet like a traditional RPG, your character and it&amp;rsquo;s attributes are all based on a sock puppet, or in Skcos lingo, a Soppet.  Each Soppet has several unique qualities which allow it to do extraordinary things!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Argyle &amp;amp; Crew is great game for children as young as 4 years old.  Short scenarios and active participation keep things lively!  Useful as a learning tool not just for gaming, but for life lessons, Argyle &amp;amp; Crew can easily be used in a classroom setting.  Professionals working on counseling children can find this game equally useful for indirectly or directly exploring past experiences and future anxieties. Use the additional rules for older children or adults and expand the game from a fun, play driven activity to a fully developed RPG, using the One-Shot RPG system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;additional information&lt;br/&gt;This game can be both diceless in it's basic form, or uses d6 for the additional RPG rules which are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
