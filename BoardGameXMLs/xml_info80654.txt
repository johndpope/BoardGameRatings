							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Snake Rattle &#039;n&#039; Roll</name>
									
			<description>Snake Rattle 'n' Roll features two snakes&amp;mdash;Rattle and Roll&amp;mdash;as they make their way through 11 levels. The object in each level is to eat enough &amp;quot;Nibbley Pibbleys&amp;quot;&amp;mdash;small round creatures found throughout each level&amp;mdash;to gain enough weight to ring a bell on top of a weighing machine located at the end of the level; this causes a door for the next level to open. Players maneuver their snakes throughout the level with the control pad and are able to pick up Nibbley Pibbleys by pressing the B button on the controller. The snakes' lengths increase when they eat Nibbley Pibbleys; their lengths grow more quickly or more slowly, depending on the color of the Nibbley Pibbley they eat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each level contains various obstacles and enemies that the players must deal with. Players lose a segment from their snake if they are hit by an enemy, and they lose a life if their snake runs out of segments. Players can also lose a life if their snakes fall too far, the timer runs out, their snakes touch a sharp object, or if they are squashed by an object from above. Also, if they remain in any body of water for too long, a shark will attack. The game ends if players lose all their lives, but they have several continues in which they can restart the game from where they left off. Players can defeat enemies by hitting them with their tongues or by jumping on them. Players can collect various items to help them along during gameplay, such as items that extend the length of the snakes' tongues, extra lives and continues, time bonuses, invisibility diamonds, and items that speed up or reverse the direction of the snakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the secrets in the game involved a rocket ship that advances the character up several levels if the end of the first level is reached quickly enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Snake Rattle 'n' Roll&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
