			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the past, there was a goddess whom extended a helping hand to a world which was about to perish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That goddess, along with the four knights who served her, healed the ruined land using &amp;quot;Grace&amp;quot;- a power that rejuvenates worn down life forces- and saved the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From then on, since the goddess' consciousness went into a slumber, she was succeeded by one who is to become a representation of her divine spirit, known as a &amp;quot;Reine&amp;quot;, and four human knights that were chosen by the world. As the world continued to enjoy the goddess' favor, it continued to develop and advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, at a certain point, even after coming into the world for generations, a Reine was not born. As a result, the supplies of Grace stagnated, and the world was once again threatened to be consumed by darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
