							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Really Simple Prestige Classes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's SO Simple!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We feel that oftentimes, prestige classes were not always &amp;ldquo;worth it&amp;rdquo;. They rob a character of their higher-level abilities and often dictate many aspects of the character&amp;rsquo;s growth by way of heavy entry requirements. This upcoming book, aptly named &amp;ldquo;Really Simple Prestige Classes&amp;rdquo; allows you to do just that! It includes 9 new 3 level, simplistic, no-frills, straightforward prestige classes! They have low entry requirements, only last a few levels, and provide a bang for their buck, yet are otherwise mundane. They are designed to complement a wide variety of classes and builds as well as to cover some areas that might have been previously overlooked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Acrobat: Dip, duck, dive and don&amp;rsquo;t get hit. Acrobat lets you evade your problems with ease with useful skills like uncanny dodge.&lt;br/&gt;    Arcane Dabbler: Now anyone can learn magic! Pick up a few useful spells and metamagic feats without impacting your BAB or HD too much.&lt;br/&gt;    Beastlord: Need an animal companion? Gain one that will be useful for the remainder of your levels as well as some nice abilities that focus on detecting and defeating beasts.&lt;br/&gt;    Enchanter: Is magical crafting your thing? Enchanter cuts down on crafting time and grants you some of the much-needed feats, allowing you to bypass a lot of red tape.&lt;br/&gt;    Magic User: Expand your spell list, boost your casting stats, and overall make your spellcasting more versatile.&lt;br/&gt;    Metamagister: Metamagic feats getting you down? Offset them with this class without sacrificing your caster level.&lt;br/&gt;    Runner: Need to get somewhere quicker? Runner boosts your movement speed, deals with terrain challenges with ease, all while still offering attracting options for skirmishing characters.&lt;br/&gt;    Weapon Master: Why be good at one weapon when you can be good at all of them? (Make sure to pick up a &amp;lsquo;Bag of Holding&amp;rsquo;, you definitely want one.)&lt;br/&gt;    Weapon Specialist: Why be good at all the weapons when you can be an undisputed master of one? Quickly learn to get the most out of your favorite weapon with free fighter feats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
