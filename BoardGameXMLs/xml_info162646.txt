							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monsanto Trek</name>
									
			<description>A Game that was published by Monsanto. On first glance it is similar to Career, but there are many differences.&lt;br/&gt;It is quite possible that it was used to find executives with the right mindset, since the questions and answers use games derived from game theory, like &amp;quot;Bach or Stravinski&amp;quot;. It uses cards, which give the player 4 choices. Each choice will change the possibilities for a career. Whoever gets the best answers can move forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Box :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Monsanto Trek. This is a game of careers and career choices. Like life, this game is about solving problems, making decisions, reaping rewards and suffering consequences. There are many different paths you can take on your Monsanto Trek, just as there are many paths you can take during your Monsanto career. There is no correct path, just the one that's right for you. So choose wisely, take a few risks and have fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
