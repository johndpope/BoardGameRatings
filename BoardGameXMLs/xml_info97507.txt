			<description>from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs play criminals that discover the world of the  supernatural through the machinations of a crazed  cultist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an effort to maximise your earning potential, you  have sought the agencies of people who help you  realise wealth with minimum effort. In this manner  you have managed to meet up Derek Anson, a  collector who knows valuable objets d'art and where  to best sell them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For your first job Derek has pointed you in the  direction of the mansion of Walter Beringsford, a  wealthy industrialist that likes to surround himself with  valuable works of art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Beringsford estate is a virtual fortress, but you  feel with your experience that the security measures  and his soft guards are no measure against you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
