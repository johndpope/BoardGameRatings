							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Halo: Fleet Battles – Covenant Fleet Box</name>
									
			<description>A giant even amongst the Sangheili, Xytan &amp;lsquo;Jar Wattinree is revered by his comrades for his incredible prowess in battle. Supported by the Minister of Etiology, a minor Prophet in the Covenant during the Human-Covenant war, this fleet delivers the leadership needed to harness a tireless religious zeal that will eventually lead to the Fall of Reach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an ideal way to upgrade an existing Covenant force or begin building your brand new fleet. Within this boxed set you will find two ORS Heavy Cruisers, two CCS-class Battlecruisers and sixteen SDV Heavy Corvettes. Armed with a host of plasma-based weaponry, the ORS and CCS are able to launch both Bombers and Interceptors directly into the heart of battle. Supported by SDV Heavy Corvettes, watch your heavy vessels lay down overwhelming weapons fire and obliterate your enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
