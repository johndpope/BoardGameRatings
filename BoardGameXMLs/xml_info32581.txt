							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Happy Face Game</name>
									
			<description>Listed in American Games, #4682.  1968, Kiddie, Board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board consists of a curving track with each space being marked with a face (Happy, Smile, Funny, Surprise or Hide. The cards also reflect these faces.&lt;br/&gt;In a turn, a player draws a card and must move his playing piece to the next space on the track showing that face.&lt;br/&gt;There are two special spaces marked in red, 'Sad' and 'Crying' faces. There is only one of each of these faces. If you draw one of these, you must go to that relative space even if it means moving backwards.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get to the Happy face at the end of the track, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To add more fun for younger players, it is suggested that when they look at their card, they should try to copy the face to the amusement of other players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
