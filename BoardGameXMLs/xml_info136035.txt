							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ultraman Game</name>
									
			<description>Nintendo Ultraman Game released in 1966 by Nintendo based on the original Ultraman TV series. The city is on the brink of total destruction. Cars are ablaze, flying from collapsing freeways. Even worse: the local stores are under threat as well. Luckily, Ultraman comes to the rescue!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultraman Game is one of Nintendo's grey band games. The game bears the UltraQ logo. UltraQ was the first of the 'Ultra' series created by Tsuburaya Productions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose one of four Earth Defense characters and advance on the board by spinning the arrow on game board. When players land on the spaces with 'guns' the other spinner is used. This determines which monster was defeated, which earn players the corresponding card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
