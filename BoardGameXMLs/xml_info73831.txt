			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t want thanks, a well-fed ego or even just a basic description of this product, feel free to start with the threat of the Deathmongers. Otherwise, read on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do we do with god level power? It&amp;rsquo;s a question asked by some who have played the Divinity RPG and other games dealing with this sub-genre of role playing. I have heard a lot of answers varying from character introspection to smashing a titan&amp;rsquo;s face. All of these are valid answers in their own way. Each answer seems to coverOf course (sic), there is no single product that can cover everything but hopefully this will give a small glimpse into what could be handled by divine level PCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product presents seven different opponents from the Mythic era to the modern era to Sci-fi, allowing for a variety of campaigns to have at least one race of powerful foes. The layout is very simple. The first part is the basic readout and description of the race followed a list of battle tactics and then powers. Finally, some plot ideas are included to get a session, multi-part adventure or maybe even a campaign going.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In any case, we hope this product contributes to&lt;br/&gt;a fun evening or three.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
