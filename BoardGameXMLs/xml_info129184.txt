			<description>Excerpts from Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once upon a time in the Land of Magic and Enchantment lived a young man named Zyll who dreamed of becoming a Master of Black Magic. Fortunately, all Zyll could do was fail - his potions never perked, the spells seldom worked. Still, Zyll was determined to practice the dark magic and promised to one day take over as Ruler of the Realm. The people banished Zyll from the land for his evil plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One day after spoiling his latest potion, Zyll hurled the flask to the ground. He watched in amazement as smoke billowed and a black orb appeared before him, suspended in air. Cautiously approaching the sphere, Zyll felt a surge of energy race through his body. This was the mystical Black Orb his ancient books of magic had described! It was written that whoever possessed the orb would have magical powers greater than any other sorcerer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using his new powers, Zyll took revenge against the land. He stole the magnificent Great Treasures that had been hidden in secret vaults for years and used the Black Orb to turn the once beautiful and wealthy country into a barren wasteland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You, daring adventurer, decide to challenge the powers of Zyll. Magically, you are transported to a place near the Castle Mitain, Zyll&amp;rsquo;s home. You must capture the mystical Black Orb and carry it home with you to restore the countryside to its former beauty. There is only one way to return home - the instant that four or more of the Great Treasures are brought together, you will be transported back to the Land of Magic and Enchantment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Type of Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second screen asks you to select the type of game you would like to play. Here are the four choices and what they mean:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire:  Play the game alone&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cooperative:  Play with another player&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Competitive:  Compete against another player&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saved Game:  Continue a saved game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tournament-Style Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time you play Zyll, many objects are randomly placed throughout the game. By pressing the Esc key while the music plays at the beginning of the program, you can cause those objects to appear in the same place each time. This is a good way to learn the game or challenge your friends in tournament-style play since the objects will be in the same spots for each tournament player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
