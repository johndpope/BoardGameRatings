							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kid Kong: The Ape Escape Game</name>
									
			<description>Kid Kong is captured and wants to break away. Setup involves turning the dial on the back of the base of the Kid Kong unit. This randomly selects a specific hole which will eventually trigger Kid Kong when the appropriate peg (from the chain) is inserted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns trying to chain Kid Kong by inserting both pegs, from the chain, into any of the 8 holes located on both sides of the ape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the chain holds, play passes to the next player. If not, Kid Kong breaks out of his chains and that player is eliminated. Repeat this process with the remaining players, when only one player in left- they are declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
