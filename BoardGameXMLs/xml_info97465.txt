			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gale Force Nine&amp;rsquo;s Official DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS Game Mats are high-quality single-sided vinyl surfaces that are ideal battle grids for staging encounters during your adventures! The mats lie flat for ease of play and are sold in a sturdy polycarbonate tube for easy storage and transport. The mats may be marked with WET-ERASE markers to temporarily alter terrain areas or make other notes about battlefield conditions during play. The Game Mats measure 20&amp;quot; x 30&amp;quot; and are marked with a 1&amp;quot; grid. All of GF9's Game Mats are based on artwork provided by Wizards of the Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deserts of Athas are cruel and unforgiving. The shifting dunes reveal lost treasures and swallow careless caravans. But these sands are not devoid of life, dangerous creatures and malicious raiders stalk the sands in search of their next victims. Rocky outcroppings dot these badlands, their shade providing a brief respite from the blazing sun. Dust sinks dot the land, a foolish traveler can be swallowed whole with one misstep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DARK SUN Desert mat is ideal for staging your encounters on the world of Athas or in any desert in any campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
