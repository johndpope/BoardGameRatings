			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stormlord the warrior is back: his quest is not over and there are fairies to be saved in four different worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deliverance is a straight action game (the puzzle elements of the first game have been toned down) where the player lead Stormlord across each level, killing enemies and picking up fairies. There are bonus rounds between each level, in which the player must pick up gold pieces (2 gold pieces buys an extra life). Each level has its hazards and creatures (the first level, Hell has all sorts of demons, the third level is an enchanted forest peopled by creatures made of living wood...), and the last level is a shoot'em up where Stormlord rides a Dragon. Each level ends with a boss fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
