			<description>After another day in the life of the young child, it's time to go to sleep. But he doesn't even imagines the existence of two mystical beings in his mind, feeding on your emotions while sleeping. One feeds on their dreams while the other feeds precisely the opposite, and therefore seeks to guide the child to the shadowy world of the most ominous and terrifying nightmares. What happens inside the confused and innocent child's mind? Only the battle between these two fantastic endless decide this. Unwary are those who think they are not plagued by such entities, they barely know that life is only a dream and we only puppets...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Limbo is a board game for 2-4 players, based on the universe created by Neil Gaiman. Players face each other for 8 rounds (the 8 hours of the child sleep), trying to influence the movement of the child in main board. For that, they should put their cards on individual boards, forming combinations of runes, skills and summoning creatures to chase the little one. Players actions must be scheduled, and the cards and creatures can be positioned in future rounds, creating a system that must be planned and thinking beyond the present moment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
