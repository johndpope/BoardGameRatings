			<description>Computerize! is a game about assembling and using a home computer, from the days when that was relatively new and interesting. Players move around the board via die rolls to get opportunities to purchase major components and minor accessories, which are checked off on record sheets. The object of the game is to check off everything on your sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Money can be raised in a number of ways. Players can sell parts back to the bank for half of the purchase price. There is an inner section of the board which can be entered (via the &amp;quot;input core buffers&amp;quot;). While there you may land on a space which lets you draw  a software card (shaped like a 5 1/4&amp;quot; floppy); if your system meets the software requirements, you collect money. Each player also starts with &amp;quot;state of the family&amp;quot; cards which can be turned in for cash, but you have to end the game with the same number of these you started with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
