							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">White Elephant: Mystery Box Promo Cards</name>
									
			<description>This promo includes seven &amp;quot;Mystery Box&amp;quot; cards and was only available through Kickstarter during the project to fund the &amp;quot;White Elephant&amp;quot; card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mystery Box Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Deal Gift Cards to each player according to the rules in the standard game, then deal one Mystery Box card to each player. Players keep this card until their turn to be the starting player. &lt;br/&gt;     Each player simultaneously places one Gift Card from their hand face-down in the center of the table as in the standard game. The starting player (the player who will select the first gift of this party) places his or her Mystery Box card face up on top of their own Gift Card. This gift is now the &amp;quot;Mystery Box&amp;quot; gift for this round. &lt;br/&gt;     The game continues as normal with the exception that when a player selects the Mystery Box gift they do not &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo; it by turning it over. The gift may be selected and stolen like any other gift without being revealed. &lt;br/&gt;     When the round is over and each player has a gift, the player with the Mystery Box gift may now look at the Gift Card without revealing it to the other players. The player, the only one who knows the color and number of that card, tucks it face-down under his or her Gift List Card. The Mystery Box card used this round may now be discarded. &lt;br/&gt;     The next round resumes with the new starting player using his or her Mystery Box card. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules Updates (12/09/2011)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When played as written in the current rules, the Mystery Boxes usually didn't hold very good presents. Therefore, the designer (Brian Kelley) suggests that you follow the current rules, except for these changes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Before looking at their cards players randomly select one of the cards dealt to them to be their Mystery Box gift, keeping it face down.&lt;br/&gt;     Players place their Mystery Box card on top of this selected card without looking at it.&lt;br/&gt;     The Mystery Boxes are then kept close to each player until it is their turn to select a gift first, and then they are the ones who bring the Mystery Box to the &amp;quot;party.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
