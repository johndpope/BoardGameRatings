			<description>Carapace is something like a refined fox-and-hounds: The two players have different sets of pieces, and the offensive player can always capture the defensive pieces eventually. In a game, each player plays each role once, and the player who eliminated the defense in the fewest moves wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is composed of rectangular spaces arranged like bricks in a wall, making it effectively hexagonal. There are blocked spaces where no one can move, and three sets of differently colored &amp;quot;closable&amp;quot; spaces - when an offensive piece is on a colored square, similarly colored squares are off limits to the defense. There are also squares numbered 1 - 3; when a defensive piece lands on one of these, the number is added to the offensive player's move total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
