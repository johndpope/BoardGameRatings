			<description>The object of the game is to earn as many euros as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes three rounds.  Each player receives a set of fifteen cards with pictures of eight coin and seven banknote values. There are twelve European countries marked with flags.  During the rounds players try to gain flags by strategically playing money cards and having the highest deposit for each country.  Flags can change hands each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the three rounds, players score according to the flags they have collected.  Countries whose flags share a common border allow a player to multiply the value of euro in these countries by 2, 3, or 4.  Two countries multiply values by two, three countries by three, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the most money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
