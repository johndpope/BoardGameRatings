							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Double: Football Game</name>
									
			<description>A game of hat tricks, F.A. Enquiries, penalty appeals, and last minute goals.&lt;br/&gt;Home and away matches against all the other players.&lt;br/&gt;The Double is a game of chance, tactics and cunning.&lt;br/&gt;Good players will win the Premiership.&lt;br/&gt;Great players will win the double. The Premiership and the F.A.Cup.&lt;br/&gt;Which will you be?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players (2-4) represent football teams vying to win the double of the Premiership, and the F.A.Cup. Each player represents either Blue (City), Yellow (County) Green (Rovers) or Red (United) and takes a corresponding coloured token and six sided dice. Players start at the bottom of the league table and a fixture card is drawn. Both players roll their dice with the winner moving up the table 3 places or 1 place if the result is draw. The board is divided into 5 zones forming from the bottom The relegation zone, danger zone, mid table, and European places. Each time a player passes into a new zone a tactic card is drawn which can used and played to affect the results of matches. The home team of each match can re-roll his result dice, but has to take that result of the re throw.&lt;br/&gt;The winner of the premiership has the advantage of choosing the draw for the F.A. Cup and has a one goal advantage on his throw, but tactic cards cannot be used by the players in the F.A. Cup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
