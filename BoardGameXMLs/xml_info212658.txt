							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Modern Basics: 2016 Annual</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2016: The Year Most Of Us Would Like To Forget?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lots of actors and arists passed away, geeks and gamers were at it each other's throats like never before, terrorists were on the march everywhere around the world, and the United States has been in the grips of the weirdest presidential election ever. It's a certainty that most people will be glad to see 2016 put behind  us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, naturally, NUELOW Games memorializes the year everyone is sick of with the release our first-ever annual. Because we're all about tapping into what's hot in popular culture!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern Basics: 2016 Annual contains two templates, ten talent trees, and eleven feats, most inspired by events in tne news and designed to augment your d20 System characters and bring your games up-to-date with ultra-postmodern age in which we live. Although this OGL material is designed with d20 Modern in mind, it is easily incorporated into your favorite iteration of the d20 System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
