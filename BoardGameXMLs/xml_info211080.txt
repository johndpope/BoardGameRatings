			<description>Couples are challenged to answer about their life, preferences and personal choices, while trying to guess the answers of your couple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's divided in 3 rounds, the first round has simple Yes/No questions, the second round you have to choose between two options and on the last round there are hypothetical situations and you should choose what you would do. In all three rounds there are different questions for each gender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the three rounds of questions have ended, it's time of reviewing the answers. Each couple scores a point for each match in their answers. The couple with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
