							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Player&#039;s Guide to Terra Ferax</name>
									
			<description>From Foreward:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document is designed to be an aid for players and referees alike. What follows in these pages is a paraphrasing of a much more detailed document Creation Myths and Deities, which starts with creation, shows the function of the gods and their hands in the process, and works its way through history to the present day. It's told from the viewpoint of the gnomes, who have a sometimes unusual view of creation, but the gods back their story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this document is brief, it should give you plenty to start a campaign in the World of Terra Ferax. Herein you will find a brief summary of creation that most characters would know about from religious education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this text are guidelines for PC behavior (the Seven works of Mercy), details of employing hospitality in your campaign, a little history (probably all the PCs would know), country information (those influencing Map One), what the skies look like, the calendar system and 145 gods that exist in Terra Ferax.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
