			<description>Buck Quest is a trivia game for hard-core hunters. There are 1500 questions that cover all aspects of hunting knowledge. For example (these questions are pulled from the same card chosen at random, really!):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. To keep tree stands from being patterned by deer, A. move, B. camouflage, C. descent the stand regularly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. To estimate the live weight of a deer, divide A 0.98762, B. 0.78612 C. 0.62553 into the dressed field weight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. A shouldered shotgun can easily be checked for proper fit; the shooter's check should rest from A. 1 to 2 B. 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 C. 2 to 3 inches back from the point of the comb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 6 such questions on each card. Players answer questions and race around the board to the finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
