							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">VeggieTales: The Madame Blueberry Hunt 4 Happiness Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The dealer shuffles the orange stuff-cards and spreads them all face down. Place the blue stuff-cards face down in a deck to the side of Madame Blueberry's pile of orange cards. The youngest player starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player draws a card from the orange pile and places it face up in front of him/her.&lt;br/&gt;If a Thankful card with a heart is drawn, discard all of your stuff cards and the next player goes.&lt;br/&gt;When an orange stuff card is drawn, put it in front of you. Even if it's a card you don't need.&lt;br/&gt;If a salesman card is drawn with a $ sign, the player must draw 2 blue stuff cards. Place those stuff cards in front of you and discard the salesman card.&lt;br/&gt;If the Madame Blueberry card is drawn, keep on drawing until you get a Thankful card. Put back all the other stuff cards, including the ones you already had.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player who gets four thankful cards to make a happy heart wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
