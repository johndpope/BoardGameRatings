							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stellaluna Memory Game</name>
									
			<description>A children's memory game with a theme based on the children's picture book by Janelle Cannon. Stellaluna loves her baby bird friends, but hates those icky bugs they have to eat in Mother Bird's nest! She needs to find her own bat family again and feast on yummy mangoes. Help Stellaluna learn the skills she needs to be a bat again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns turning over memory chips. If it is a helper chip, they place it the sky path and move Stellaluna one space forward. If it is not, they turn it back over again and leave it in place. When Stellaluna reaches home, all players win! There is a more advanced ruleset for older players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is intended to teach young players to develop memory and story-telling skills as well as important social skills: taking turns, following rules, sharing and respecting others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
