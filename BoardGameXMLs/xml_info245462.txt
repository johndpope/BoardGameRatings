							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Garden of Zen</name>
									
			<description>This is a 9-card nano game in which two players try to construct a zen garden that will match the hidden goal card.  Each card has both a component of the garden and a victory condition.  By clever placement and logical deduction, players try to discern which victory condition is on the last remaining card.  The game is quick, but encourages contemplative interaction and logical thinking.&lt;br/&gt;There are alternate rule sets that allow a competitive game, where you try to prevent your opponent from meeting their goal while trying to make yours, or to play solo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
