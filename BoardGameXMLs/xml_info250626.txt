			<description>Ultima Ratio Regis is board game, which recreates the military history of the Modern European era; starting with the discovery of America, and ending with the French revolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game spans 20 turns of 15 years, with a duration of two to four hours each; and is organized into multi-turn scenarios, including a possible &amp;quot;Great Campaign&amp;quot; that would cover all 20 turns.&lt;br/&gt;In Ultima Ratio Regis, players will lead the different powers that disputed world hegemony during the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the scenario chosen and the number of players, a power pack is distributed to each player.  The initial scenarios supplied are between 3 and 5 turns (each turn is a game session).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During these sessions, in consecutive impulses and in a card driven system, the players take action with their powers to obtain victory points (which are the objectives that each power pursues).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although there are economic and diplomatic actions, Ultima Ratio Regis is a military campaign game, so it is focused on the different naval or land campaigns that the powers carried out in the modern age to achieve their objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The military system is very original (it covers half of the rules), and with it, we not only fight great land and naval battles, but also sieges and long land campaigns of erosion of the enemy.  The scale of play varies depending on where we have our military units, but to give us an idea, a western land unit represents approximately a whole regiment, and a naval squadron about 10 ships of line or between 30 and 50 galleys in the Mediterranean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game include a new system that prevents great uchronies, without over-directing the players.  In this way, the player with the most victory points accumulated between all his powers wins, that is, the one who has come closest to the objectives of the set of powers he is carrying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is currently in Spanish, but in a few months there will be a free print and play version in English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
