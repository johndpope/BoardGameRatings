			<description>Scar plots to get rid of Simba by telling him about a dangerous elephant graveyard.  Just as he hopes, Simba and Nala head for this forbidding place, where a pack of hungry hyenas await them.  Can you help King Mufasa rescue the cubs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in Disney's Giant Board Game Book, The Lion King is a roll-and-move game where players must move two markers representing Simba and Nala simultaneously along a track, trying to reach the end and be rescued by Mufasa.  Along the way, they may land on spaces that move them forward or backward or cause loss or gain of turns.  If a player lands on another marker, they move back six spaces, and in order to start moving a marker at the beginning of the game, they must roll at least a three.  The book comes with an &amp;quot;electronic&amp;quot; die that generates random number from 1 to 6. A small element of strategy is added by the ability to move either marker, offering the choice to move the marker that will land on an advantageous space or avoid a negative space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
