							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Druids &amp; Druidism</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long overshadowed by their clerical brethren, Druids and Druidism levels the playing field with their divine colleagues by providing eight new prestige classes, more than twenty new feats and twenty-five new spells for druids of all levels. In addition to these features, the supplement thoroughly discusses and details the druid's relationship with nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contained with its pages are rules for manufacturing herbal remedies and toxins from plants, harvesting venom from poisonous animals, fashioning tools, armor, shields and weapons from natural materials and acquiring the devotion of an animal companion. This 70-page supplement also focuses on the druid's relationship with others of his kind, detailing the costs and ceremonies needed to found, create and maintain a druidic circle. Druids and Druidism breathes fresh, new life into an often neglected character class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
