			<description>This expansion was on the back of the catalogue of the Haba Family Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 4 tiles are set out face down and shuffled in a stack. If a player picks up an herb tile with the value of &amp;quot;2&amp;quot; they can immediately trade it for one of these bonus herb tiles. To do so, the player picks up the top tile from the stack of bonus herb tiles. The traded-in herb tile is removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. &amp;quot;Gold sword&amp;quot; bonus herb tile&lt;br/&gt;2 dice (instead of just one) can be used for the gold sword. The tile is removed from the game after it has been used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. &amp;quot;Platinum sword&amp;quot; bonus herb tile&lt;br/&gt;3 dice (instead of just one) can be used for the platinum sword. The tile is removed from the game after it has been used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. &amp;quot;Magic gold herbs&amp;quot; bonus herb tile&lt;br/&gt;Combat strength is increased by 5 points when the magic gold herb tile is used. The tile is removed from the game after it has been used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. &amp;quot;Loyal wolf&amp;quot; bonus herb tile&lt;br/&gt;Combat strength is increased by 2 points when the wolf tile is used. The wolf remains at the side of the player as a loyal companion and can be used in every battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
