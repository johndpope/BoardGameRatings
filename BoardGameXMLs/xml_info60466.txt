			<description>User Note: Level 4-6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one ever said the job of a hero was an easy one...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The young daughter of a local Count is missing, kidnapped by unknown forces. Her young life hangs in jeopardy, and her father cannot pay the impossible ransom that has been asked for her return. Desperate to find his daughter, he has promised gold, riches, magic treasures to anyone that can rescue her from her captors. She is only twelve years old.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You prowl the streets of Desburg by night, seeking anyone that might know the whereabouts of Princess Alexandria. Her caravan left only three nights ago, filled with retainers and servants, and guarded by her father's own men. The wreckage of the caravan was found one day's ride south of the city, destroyed and bloodied. Only the body of the Princess was missing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suddenly, there is a scream. A terrified young girl in torn garments races toward you from the darkness, pleading for her life. Behind her, five black-garbed figures spring from the shadows in pursuit. Hurled from a distance, a dagger pierces the young woman's leg and she falls. &amp;quot;Please help me,&amp;quot; she cries out. &amp;quot;My name is Lady Alexandria, Princess of Desburg...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
