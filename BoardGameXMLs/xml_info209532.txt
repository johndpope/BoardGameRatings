			<description>Meteln is a dice game all about honey and mead (honey wine). As in Yahtzee, players roll five dice and try to get the best combination out of three rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meteln is played with five special twelve-sided dice, the faces of which show symbols like a flower meadow, bees, beehive, honey &amp;amp; mead. The dice also have two wild faces that allow the player to choose the symbol they need. To score points, you need at least three suitable symbols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after 13 rounds, and whoever has the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scoring sheet is available as a free download in German and English, and other languages will follow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
