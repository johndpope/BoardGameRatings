These generational heroes master several different forms of combat, minor alchemy, and even modest forms of magic to complete their task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster Tamers - The dwarves of the Kingdom of Monsters have taken to training companions of their own. Not only do they befriend monsters (rather than capture them), they can learn to become one themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Archetypes and Class Options&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alchemist &amp;ndash; Groon bombardiers are bomb-focused alchemists who gain their powerful explosives in exchange for weaker extracts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generational Hero &amp;ndash; The twin blade is a hero who draws his traits from an artifact still bound to his homeworld. Usng its power, he can split into multiple warriors, each able to battle alongside the rest. Meanwhile, the Big Groon Blademaster and silver scale hero take their generational hero training in different directions while staying true to its source.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magus &amp;ndash; Sorcerer thanes are magi trained by the mighty sorcerer king. Thieves at heart, they practice magic and trickery with equal fervor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paladin &amp;ndash; As paladins go, walkers in the sun have a different way of helping their allies and harming their enemies (particularly undead).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character Options&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A handful of new feats take inspiration from the shattered worlds, allowing characters to quickly duck behind a barrel after killing somebody, create a pair of magic rings through which others can pass, or even bolster their own souls with the deaths of others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn to cast the deadly fallout spell, which not only sets things on fire, but also poisons it for a long, long time. Available to clerics, wizards, and alchemists (with a grand discovery).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Added several new, specific weapons and magical equipment for characters wishing to see items that exist within the shattered worlds. Wield a groonsword, buster blade, or a warhammer of the eternal crusade (for only forty-thousand gold!); wear a mask that transforms you into another race, or crack open a fairy bottle for some quick healing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
