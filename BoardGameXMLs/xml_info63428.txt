			<description>Throw the best wine-tasting party ever  with the Blind Wine - Wine Tasting Game. We provide the materials, you provide the wine... and guests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a great way to challenge your friends tastes and test an old question; Is the best wine really the most expensive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's how it works. You send the included invitations to friends asking them to bring a bottle of wine. Each bottle goes into the bag and becomes a number. Guest rate each hidden bottle with a guided scorecard and a winning bottle is selected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Six invitations and envelopes&lt;br/&gt;-Suggestion booklet&lt;br/&gt;-First place medal&lt;br/&gt;-Six competition wine bags&lt;br/&gt;-Twelve scoring cards&lt;br/&gt;-Instructions&lt;br/&gt;-12 Scoring pencils&lt;br/&gt;-Six thank you cards&lt;br/&gt;-Fourteen wine glass labels&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
