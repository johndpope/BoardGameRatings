			<description>Absolution is a cooperative game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game.  To quote the designer:&lt;br/&gt;I like cooperative games, especially &amp;quot;Shadows Over Camelot&amp;quot; by Serge Laget and Bruno Cathala, so I designed Absolution as a cooperative adventure with a Stonehenge theme. Similarly to &amp;quot;Shadows Over Camelot,&amp;quot; I wanted Absolution to be difficult, but not impossible to win with the right strategy among the players. Many Stonehenge scholars can agree upon two points: It looks like some sort of astronomical clock, and people died there. In Absolution, the clock is ticking. Whether anyone dies tonight will be determined by you. Save the Druid!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The usual &amp;quot;no telling what your cards are&amp;quot; rule for collaborative games applies.  Utilizing a central exchange field to swap cards, players try to set up their hands to be able to play a single card that matches the current turn number (1&amp;ndash;30), or a pair of cards whose sum or difference equals the turn number.  Your success at doing this determines the pace at which the poor druid walks to the altar to be sacrificed.  Don't let it happen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Absolution is an official game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
