							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sir Ababol</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;An unfortunate happenstance left poor Sir Ababol without his sword. The only way for him to retrieve his beloved blade is to collect wild poppies, scattered throughout the various screens in this arcade adventure - only then will his sword be returned to him. There is questing to be done, and it is up to you, Sir Ababol, to do it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;Sir Ababol is a retro-style platform action arcade adventure. The player controls sir Ababol, jumping around and collecting flowers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was originally created for the ZX Spectrum, quickly ported to the Amstrad CPC by the same team, then to Commodore 64 by the team Inside, and finally to NES; also released in a remastered edition for NES. The NES remaster is, according to the developpers an &amp;quot;engine which plays way better and a couple of really interesting easter eggs which are designed to extend the life of this game a bit further (you'll have to complete the game to find out, though)&amp;quot;, as they had found pirate versions of their game from the original release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Commodore 64 port saw several releases, on disk, cartridge (2-in-1) and disk (3-in-1).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits&lt;br/&gt;na_th_an: code (ZX, CPC), graphics (CPC, C64), music (CPC)&lt;br/&gt;anjuel: concept, story, graphics (ZX, C64), music (ZX)&lt;br/&gt;maribip: concept, story&lt;br/&gt;zemman: concept, story &lt;br/&gt;kendrook: graphics (ZX, CPC, C64)&lt;br/&gt;Woodmaster: code (C64)&lt;br/&gt;Conrad: Music, sound (C64)&lt;br/&gt;Linus: tape loader musix (C64)&lt;br/&gt;Shiru: Tools, optimization (NES)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
