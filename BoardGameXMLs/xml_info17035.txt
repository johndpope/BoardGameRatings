			<description>Alternative Armies' second attempt at a game in their Ion Age universe, this transports the action to the world of Golgotha, the &amp;quot;last battlefield&amp;quot; of the Great War.  It also modifies the background found in the Firefight game which ostensibly takes place in the same setting.  It uses the Ion Age miniatures produced by their company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 factions - the Confederacy, the Khanate and the Trators (a mixture of mercenaries and scavengers).  Players can play in either 15mm or 28mm scale - the army lists differ, with the smaller scale featuring larger vehicles like tanks.  A points buy system is provided - players will control a squad or two in a typical game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic game system is fairly straightforward, using a 10-sided die and centimeters.  All players move (using jumpacs for extra speed), then all units fire, with the latter normally being simultaneous.  Roll to hit - on a successful hit, you inflict damage, generally by chipping away at the opponent's armor and wound totals.  Heavy weapons will generally vaporize a target in one hit and have enormous ranges - consequently they dominate the game.  Finally, there is melee, which, as is typical for a science-fiction game, is generally more lethal than ranged combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself could either be purchased as a PDF file or as a bound rulebook of about 94 pages (11 of them rules with another 17 pages of optional rules, most of which are geared towards providing a campaign system).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
