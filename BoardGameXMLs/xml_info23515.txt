							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Die Troll Familie</name>
									
			<description>Simple memory game for children 5 years and older. Each player places their troll at the start of a path, with each space on the path showing a fruit corresponding to a fruit marker. The fruit markers are placed face down on the table and shuffled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, a player turns over a fruit token. If it shows the same fruit as the next space on the player's path, the player's troll moves to that space; if not, the troll stays where it is. In any case, the token is put back, face down, and it's the next player's turn. The player whose troll reaches the end of the path first, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 1 game board, 4 trolls, 7 round fruit markers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
