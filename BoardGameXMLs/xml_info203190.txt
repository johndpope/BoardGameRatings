			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between) but IS already available for sale / early access, so CAN BE PLAYED.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shepherds of the Abyss is an action-packed, multiplayer tower defense game - one inspired by some of the best tower defense mods for Warcraft 3. Some of its key features include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE SHEPHERDS&lt;br/&gt;The Shepherds are powerful hero units that you unlock and customize. Each has an ability kit containing three regular abilities and an ultimate ability. Shepherds gain experience and level-up during combat, and with each level comes a skill point that can be spent to upgrade one of the Shepherd's abilities. Skillful use and customization of Shepherd abilities is critical to overcoming your opponents' defenses and defeating them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ITEMS&lt;br/&gt;If your opponents has set up a good counter to your Shepherds and their abilities, however, you can also equip your Shepherds with powerful items. Some items provide passive bonuses, like increased armor or health regeneration, while other items can be used actively to give buffs or one-time consumable effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;MAZING&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Mazing&amp;quot; is the art of filling a wide-open space in a tower defense game with your towers to build the longest possible path (the maze) that the enemy's units must travel before reaching your throne. &amp;quot;Mazing&amp;quot; is a core skill in Shepherds of the Abyss, and it's put to the test with random obstacles spawned each game to prevent you from memorizing the strongest maze setup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EMPOWERING TOWERS&lt;br/&gt;When Towers deal damage to units, you gain a resource called Rage. Rage can be spent to cast a spell that Empowers the targeted tower, which causes it to unleash its true potential. Some towers may then gain a snare, shred armor, freeze units in place, or deal significantly more damage. The Empowered state is unique for each tower, and considering each tower's full potential is critical in deciding where to place them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CURRENT FEATURES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     3 Shepherds (hero units)&lt;br/&gt;     Items that can be purchased during matches and equipped on Shepherd units, including passive and activatable items &lt;br/&gt;     12 Attack Towers with different firing mechanics and positional strengths and weaknesses, as well as unique Empowered states &lt;br/&gt;     1v1 map and mode &lt;br/&gt;     Tutorial missions &lt;br/&gt;     Single Player vs AI (the AI is a work in progress) &lt;br/&gt;     Single Player Wave Survival mode&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ON THE HORIZON&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Additional Shepherds&lt;br/&gt;     Additional Items&lt;br/&gt;     Additional game modes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
