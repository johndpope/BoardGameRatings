			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventurers' actions come back to haunt them when they're arrested and part of their punishment is to care for the children of one of their victims. Nothing in their prior careers or adventures prepared them for seeing to the welfare of two traumatized kids who hate their new caregivers. And what of the mysterious enemies who are more than willing to use the youngsters to exact their revenge on the PCs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Balance Due is a one-page, no-frills adventure for Cepheus Engine and other tabletop RPG science fiction games using a 2D6 mechanic (including The Original 2D6 Science Fiction Game) starring characters of varied career backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
