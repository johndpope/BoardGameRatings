			<description>Publisher Blurb/From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For longer than two millennia they raided and subjugated their civilized neighbours of the West and the East. Europe, Russia, China and the Islamic Caliphate feared them and sometimes revered them as their masters. For no matter which tribe led them, whether Huns, Turks or Mongols, the Steppe Nomads ruled over Central Asia and dared to wage war against anyone in the world, believing that their god Tengri had granted them power over all inferior mortals. And in truth the gods of war often smiled upon their armies, blessing them with victory over countless enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wind on the Steppes is a supplement for the Basic Roleplaying system describing the features common to all nomad tribes and the peculiarities of each nomad ethnicity or empire. Within it you will find inspiration for fleshing out powerful enemies for your historical campaigns based on other Alephtar Games supplements. But its use is not limited to providing you with more detailed &amp;ldquo;bad guys&amp;rdquo;: Nomads can be fascinating player characters, too. The harsh life of the steppe and the unique flavour of their shamanistic approach to the supernatural world will give you plenty of great roleplaying opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game supplement offers a realistic representation of nomad society and may put players in contact with practices that someone might find disturbing like slavery, human sacrifices, mistreatment of women and extreme physical abuse. It is therefore recommended for a mature audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
