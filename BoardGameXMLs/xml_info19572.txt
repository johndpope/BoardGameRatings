			<description>Touristo&lt;br/&gt;The Board Game of Singapore&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;TOURISTO is a board game for two or more players. The play consists of getting to know some of the interesting places in Singapore, collecting as many token points as possible and escaping the multifarious pitfalls that are intricately simulated in the pot luck cards. Each player competes for the highest token value and he can strategize and take advantage by using his discretion wisely. The players can also have great fun and laughter with the creative catch-phrases that are used to portray the interesting places.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was obviously targeted at the tourist market. It is small, portable and features tourist destinations in Singapore, some of which are no longer around. References to the defunct Van Kleef Aquarium and Bukit Turf Club date the game to the 1980s or early 1990s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It features a Monopoly style board with pictures of the tourist attractions on the spaces. There are 'Pot Luck' cards that act like chance cards, and token cards with point values that the players are trying to collect. Player's pieces feature a tiny Merlion's head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
