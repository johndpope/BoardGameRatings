			<description>Subtitled: Rules for fighting large actions of the Second World War&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game web site:&amp;quot;Megablitz is a set of operational-level wargames rules for 20th Century warfare. The main features of the rules are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing pieces - model figures and vehicles mounted on stands - represent battalion-sized or regiment-sized units, depending upon the type of unit being represented. These units are allocated Strength Points (SP) which relate to each unit's type (e.g. Infantry, Cavalry, Armour), strength, equipment, and level of training. Strength Point markers are attached to the back of each stand, and are changed when the unit loses Strength Points as a result of combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ground scale used is very large (1:25,000 in games using 20 mm scale figures and vehicles and 1:50,000 in games using 1:300th scale figures and vehicles).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game moves represent two hours of actual time.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
