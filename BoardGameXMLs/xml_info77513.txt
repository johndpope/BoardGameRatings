			<description>[From the manual]:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The avwl' batlh - the Honor Guard - has a long and glorious history. It is only because of your impressive fighting skills and the honour of your house and school that you have been chosen to join this elite group of warriors. [...] As the Emperor is the heart of the empire, and the Defense Forces are the weapons in the empire's hands, so the 'avwl' batlh is its honour. Your first duty is to protect the High Council, while preserving the honour of the Guard as you would your own and that of your house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[...]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As leader of the Klingon High Council, Gowron accepts only the finest, proven warriors as his guards. Foremost amongst Gowron's Honor Guard detachment is Korek.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[...]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent months, Korek has initiated a supplemental training program to hone the skills and maintain the readiness of the Honor Guard warriors. This program of advanced training complements the training received at the Dun vajpu' DuSaQmey by exercising each warrior's fighting skills, philosophical grounding, and strategic thinking in simulated battles and tactical situations. All members of the Honor Guard cycle through this holodeck training regularly, from the most hardened veteran down through the newest rookie. Now it is your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
