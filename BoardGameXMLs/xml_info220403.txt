							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sleepy Hollow School of the Arcane Skein Deck</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the magic filled world of Sleepy Hollow!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sleepy Hollow is a magic spinning, dark humor filled, and uniquely strange take on being a practitioner of the arcane arts. Based in modern day America, this in character student handbook outlines the over-the-top experience that a student should expect to experience in the bizarre world of Sleepy Hollow. In this world players can participate as a student working to learn the arcane arts, trying to survive to graduation, and then joining the ranks of one of many post-study programs. After post-studies, those students that survive (roughly 2%) join a number of arcane orders so that they can be the first line of defense to keep the supernatural away from humanity. So get your quick draw holsters ready, make sure you have stocked up on bandages and whiskey, and welcome to the world of Sleepy Hollow School of the Arcane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game world introduces wand movement and verbal components to the CHRONOS Universal LARP system, where participants will not only be able learn Sleepy Hollow specific magic, but also steal arcane knowledge from any other number of CHRONOS universe decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deck Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Each card has the game mechanics on the card, so no more looking up powers in a book mid-game&lt;br/&gt;    Each card has color and design coding to make selection simple&lt;br/&gt;    2 Augmented Knowledge Cards&lt;br/&gt;    6 House Cards&lt;br/&gt;    16 Craft Specialty Cards&lt;br/&gt;    12 World Specific Equipment Cards&lt;br/&gt;    30 Spell Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
