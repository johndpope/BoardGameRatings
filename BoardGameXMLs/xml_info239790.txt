			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character Options for a Digital Age!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A spacefarer&amp;rsquo;s life is a difficult one, fraught with danger. She is surrounded by hazardous environments, encounters strange and hostile alien species, and must often make do with outdated, or even glitch, equipment. If one wants to live long adventuring among the stars, it&amp;rsquo;s important to be the best that one can be. The Spacefarer&amp;rsquo;s Digest series contains new player options and content, from character themes and races, to archetypes, feats, spells, and more, allowing every traveler among the stars to reach their maximum potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volume features a collection of new character themes, all of which are linked to the digital world. Included are the blogger, a cyber journalist with a nose for the truth and the ability to shape public opinion, the hacker, a computer expert who can get past any kind of digital security, the transhumanist, who specializes in using technological advances to leave the limitations of her race behind, and the VR junkie, whose experiences in virtual reality leave her well-prepared for a life of adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
