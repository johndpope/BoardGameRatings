			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob spotted him across the promenade. The old, grainy photo Jacob held didn't do the man justice. Dressed in a finely tailored, blue    pinstripe suit, Heinrick Anders was the epitome of a 1920's robber baron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This should be easy,&amp;quot; Jacob thought as he watched the man hold court. Men and women seemed to breathlessly hang on Heinrick's every word and the man ate it up. As Jacob watched, Heinrick gestured furiously slicing the air with his short cigarette.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;All I have to do is find the text and that should be a whole lot easier with King Anders over there occupied by his subjects,&amp;quot; Jacob offered to himself and then chuckled. Jacob fished a scrap of paper out of his pocket. On it was scrawled two numbers: 34.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where do you go when the action starts? To the battle map, of course! If you need a map of a modern structure, you need Modern Floorplans. The Modern Floorplans series from Fabled Environments offers gamers high quality maps in a variety of configurations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Want to draw it out yourself? Use the 8.5x11 map as a guide.&lt;br/&gt;     Want to simply drop the map on the table and play? Use either the 24x36 full map (if you have access to a plotter printer) or print the tiled version on regular paper and assemble a full-size version yourself in a matter of minutes. Both versions are scaled at 1 inch equals 5 feet.&lt;br/&gt;     In addition, each floorplan also comes in versions without room labels and without furniture.&lt;br/&gt;     This flooplan take advantage of both the Layers feature and the Tile Large Page function of Adobe Acrobat X&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All maps are created by an architectural drafter using AutoCAD. This gives all of the maps the realistic feel that your players crave. Grab a copy of Modern Floorplans: Hotel today, and keep an eye out for future releases!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Luftschiff Majestic&amp;quot;, an &amp;quot;average&amp;quot; modern airship&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Named Luftschiff Majestic, this new rigid airship is truly a hotel in the sky. Like her namesake, the ocean liner RMS Majestic, Luftschiff Majestic carries her passengers across the sea in luxury. Unlike ocean liners, the Luftschiff Majestic offers passengers breathtaking views from an astounding one thousand feet above sea level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new airship actually consists of a large rigid frame filled with a safe, lighter than air gas, known as hydrogen, a control gondola and a multi-tiered structure housing passengers and crew alike. Wedged in between the control gondola and the passenger area is a spacious cargo area. Likewise, another large cargo area has been placed between the rear engines and the passenger area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Passengers and crew enter the craft via a gangplank on the ground that leads to an entry on the bottom level of the craft. Housed on this lower level are the crew quarters. Quarters are divided up with officers housed in between a set of crew quarters. Officers are given the luxury of single beds while the twelve crew members are housed in bunk beds. Spacious showers and bathrooms are also afforded the crew of this magnificent craft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second level will not disappoint. Officer and crew messes are located on this level as well as the main kitchen for the ship. However, the bulk of this level is designated for passengers with a sealed smoking cabin, bar, lavatory facilities for both sexes as well as showers for passengers. Both the smoking cabin and bar are lavishly appointed with dark leather furniture and rick mahogany trim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However , where the Luftschiff Majestic really shines is on the third level. The top level of the passenger area houses forty, double occupancy, passenger births, a dining room, reading area and two grand promenades flanking either side of the ship. Here passengers can take their meals, listen to a jazz pianist or simply relax in the lounge area. Although each cabin is small by hotel standards, they are all richly appointed and sure to satisfy the most demanding tastes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
