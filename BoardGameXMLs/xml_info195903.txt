							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">2184 Generation War</name>
									
			<description>After numerous wars and conflicts in which history has forgotten their names, the planet Earth has become a vast territory where only irradiated animals and humans fighting for their survival live in this devastated world, cities comprise of the last humans unaltered by toxic winds that now sweep the surface. Directed with an iron hand by draconian dictatorships, they are the theater of war between the various institutions in place. These wars give grounds for many skirmishes despite an omnipresent police force overwhelmed by the violence of this closed universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2184 is a skirmish game between 2-4 players on various fields of battle. The objectives are varied and include a campaign which can be separated into several scenarios if you wish. You will choose a clan among the 6 available and will evolve its leaders over 3 generations. When your leader has gained 10 points of experience, his son will succeed him then the son of his son, the third generation will be able to access a new field of competence :  PSY powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major asset of 2184 is to provide a fluid game system with ease of access, to share the fun of miniature games with family and friends, and for people outside of the hobby to discover the pleasure of the game. The simplicity of the game is thanks to a unique and ingenious system, this will keep the tactical advantage of this type of game,  implementing a storyline and tracking the progress of your clan leader who will become stronger over sessions. In campaign mode, the first player to reach level 10 with his 3rd generation wins the game. There is no obligation to play each scenario in an orderly manner. The life of this game is like an open book with many possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2184 Generation War is a rulebook. No miniatures brand imposed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
