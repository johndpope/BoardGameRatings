							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pirelli</name>
									
			<description>Pirelli is a card game played with a standard deck of 52 cards.  Points are scored by having the largest total value in rows, columns, and diagonals on a 5x5 board.  Additional bonus points are given by having adjacent cards of the same suit.  Play is simultaneous with each player selecting a card from his or her cards.  The player with the lower numbered card then places both cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was the basis for the game FNAP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
