							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BohÃªme 1618</name>
									
			<description>This 2 players wargame will be included in VaeVictis magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It covers the event of summer 1618 during which the Bohemian parliament faced the power of the Habsbourg emperor. Armies will face each others to battle for the control of Bohemia and  the competition of influence will also take place in the different regional Diets to join a side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls armies (composed of cavalry, infantry and artillery) under different generals. These armies will receive orders to conduct operations aiming at controlling or pillaging territories, destroying enemies or besieging cities.&lt;br/&gt;Each player tries to control the largest amount of towns in Bohemia and particularly the capital Prague.&lt;br/&gt;Combats and sieges are resolved with a roll to hit system using a d6. At the end of fights some of the routes units can be rallied, some are lost and some might potentially switch side.&lt;br/&gt;Both sides also have resources they they can spend to supply armies or influence votes in regional diets to obtain their supports.&lt;br/&gt;Random events will also affect the campaign such as snow, pillages, uprising or political shifts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an operational level game with 108 counters and requires just a few coins (pennies will do) and a d6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
