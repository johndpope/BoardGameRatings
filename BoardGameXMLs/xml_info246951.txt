							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gladiator (VideoBrain)</name>
									
			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This video game cartridge provides players with three basic games. In Ancient Gladiator, players use bow and arrow to fight and defend against hungry lions and other players. In Modern Gladiator, players must run or pass to two different receivers to score points. And in Future Gladiator, players control laser-firing spaceships in an interstellar setting. The games can be played in a multiplayer format or versus the computer. Player-set variables allow for as many as 381 variations in gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game cartridge was manufactured for the VideoBrain, a 1977 (fairly unsuccessful) entrant in the personal computer market manufactured by Umtech Incorporation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
