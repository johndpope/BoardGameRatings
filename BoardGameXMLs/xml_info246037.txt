			<description>You and your band of adventurers have stumbled onto treasure in a cave, but you&amp;rsquo;ve awoken a powerful enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You want the treasure all to yourself, and you&amp;rsquo;ll do anything to anyone that gets in the way, and that means other adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Misdirection, 2-8 players are pitted against each other with the sole goal of surviving. With a global enemy in play, players don't attack each other; instead players force other players to play cards they don't want to resulting in the enemy attacking them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
