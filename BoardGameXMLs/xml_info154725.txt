							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ravensburger Spiele Minis: Such Die Affen</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Spiele Minis&amp;quot; is a series of small surprise boxes (i.e., you don't know what you get) from Ravensburger. They are meant to be carry-on or gifts, suitable for children (&amp;quot;Mitbringspiel&amp;quot;). Some of the cubes contain actual games, others contain magic tricks, puzzles etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game similar to Mastermind but smaller. Each player receives a screen, 3 monkeys (red, blue, yellow) and a board with 6 spaces from 1 to 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round a player will hide his monkeys (in spaces 1 to 6) while the other tries to guess their location. For that the second player will place her monkeys where she thinks player 1 has his and reveal her board. Player 1 then has to say how many monkeys are in the right position and so on until she gets it right. Then the roles will be exchanged. The player that guesses the right combination in the fewest tries will be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
