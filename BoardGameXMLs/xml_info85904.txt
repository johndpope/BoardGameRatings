			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fer &amp;amp; Flamme (&amp;quot;Iron &amp;amp; Flame&amp;quot;) is a French computer roleplaying game developed by Herv&amp;eacute; Lange. The once powerful realm of Thulynte is on the verge of civil war, and besieged by the minions of the mighty wizard Kh&amp;acirc;al. It's up to a band of heroes to restore order and defeat the forces of darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fer &amp;amp; Flamme is a party-based RPG, with rules heavily inspired by Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons (character classes and levels, races, monsters). The player creates a party of five characters, distributing points between 4 traits (strength, intelligence, dexterity, wisdom) and choosing spells and equipment and sets out to explore Thulynte.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a system of icons for player input. The display switches between an overland map for travel, a first-person view when exploring cities, and a top-down tactical view for combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fer &amp;amp; Flamme was huge for an Amstrad game, with a 40000 squares map and cities with more than 120 different locations, using all the space available on both sides of two floppies. A PC port was started by UBI Soft but abandoned when the main developer quit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
