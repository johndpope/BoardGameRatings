			<description>Disciples is a religious themed card game for 2 players.&lt;br/&gt; As the Disciples are put into play, the players attempt to play cards from their hand attempting to get the required number of cards on a Disciple to close him out. Certain Disciples have special rules associated with them about how cards can be played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a Disciple is closed out, he is scored and another takes his place. This continues until only 1 Disciple remains. When this happens, the game is over and the total is taken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
