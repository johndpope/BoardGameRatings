			<description>From the inlay (Soft Aid compilation):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your task is to rescue the Orola who escaped by retreat pod when their planet was blown to pieces and were flung to the far corners of the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game feels like a strange mixture of Jet-Pac, Defender and Choplifter. The player controls a hovering bike. The controls are to fly left or right and to thrust upwards from the ground. There is no fire button - the bike is constantly firing a laser. Enemy aliens are flying around at various heights. The level is several screens wide and wraps around like Defender. The player must navigate around the level looking for small yellow aliens. When found, the player picks up the alien and must transport it below his bike back to his spaceship. At this point the spaceship takes off and the game moves to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paul Curtis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
