			<description>Road Kill Truckers puts the players behind the wheel of a truck that is barreling down a rural highway.  Normally, the local wildlife crosses the road without any problems, but not today.  Players roll custom animal dice to determine which animals are in the lanes ahead, then decide which lane to swerve into, rolling dice to see if they hit or miss the animal in the new lane.  Each round has the players in a different turn order and each players' choice can affect the other players by removing available options.  The animals are assigned a point value from 1 to 6 and the players roll six sided dice to see if they can roll a number equal to or greater than the animal's value.  The winner is determined once the trucks reach the end of the road by adding up all the points from the animals that were successfully hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
