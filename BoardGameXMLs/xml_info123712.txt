							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hanabi: Festival</name>
									
			<description>Hanabi is a card game for 2-5 players designed by Luke Morris in 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the city's big summer festival. As the hot, happy afternoon has worn on there has been much drinking, eating and laughter from  the crowds bustling around the brightly coloured stalls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now as the sun sets, the people take to the grassy banks of the nearby river to watch the highlight of the day - the spectacular fireworks display.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are in charge of the fireworks and will compete to draw the most spectators to their display. Hanabi is a card game based on rummy with players completing sets of fireworks in their hands before laying them down to send them exploding into the night sky and to draw the spectators to their side of the river bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
