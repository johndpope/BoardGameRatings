							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Secrets of Tragic Europe</name>
									
			<description>Tragic Europe; a place of sorcerers, magic and unexplainable creatures. Your mission is to go in search of Joyeuse &amp;ndash; the great scholar thief of the Second Dark Age. You are charged with this mission by the albino Count Tierkreis, to retrieve the very essence of Joyeuse herself&amp;hellip; her soul. The reason for this you do not yet know but the events of your mission may lead you to question his motives, along with all that you have previously held true.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will travel throughout Tragic Europe. In Eire you will encounter the disappearing city, to Parye for the great Tournament of Champions, on to Eastern Europe and elsewhere and finally to Londre, where you will witness one of the greatest showdowns in history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secrets of Tragic Europe is one giant scenario; however each chapter, in its own right, can be used as a stand alone game. So if you only have enough time to battle with a few Granbretanian soldiers and a handful of vile creatures or if you wish to battle your way all across Europe, here in lays the key.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So rally your fellow warriors and arm yourselves well, for ahead of you lay dangers unlike any that you will have encountered before &amp;ndash; not even in your darkest nightmares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
