			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;The land of Dudania was once peaceful, safe, and gentle, with no more than the usual level of religious persecution and torture, racial intolerance, unjust executions, bloody warfare, and lack of proper hygeine typical to a world in the grips of pulp literary medievalism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six months ago, three meteors fell to the earth, and from each crawled a Dungeon Lord: Yecnad Nayr the Annoying, Nostrebor Tap the Unholy, and the most foul Setag Lib the Devourer of Worlds. They slaughtered and ate all who came to loot the corpes see if someone needed help, then burrowed into the ground to establish their nightmarish lairs...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, monsters swarm from the dungeons, spawned by the Dungeon Lords, and they are increasing in numbers and power. Brave heroes are needed to enter these dungeons and slay the Dungeon Lords. Are you worthy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DUDEHack is a game set in the world of hack-and-slash swords and sorcery fantasy, but characters may or may not carry that out as the focus of the game. Completely ignoring the tropes of the genre and setting up businesses, settling down, and being law-abiding citizens is not an easy course, either, when the entire history of the genre conspires against you...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
