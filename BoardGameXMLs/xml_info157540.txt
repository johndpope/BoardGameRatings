			<description>from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This supplement is a collection of alternate rules and extra options that can be used for the Tunnels &amp; Trollsâ„¢ 5th edition role-playing game &amp;hellip; from Flying Buffalo Inc. The 4th edition of the rules would also suffice , as well as the rules for the Monsters! Monsters! game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this book are new kindred and character types to play as characters. There is also a more condensed and simplified weapon and armor listing, along with a comprehensive list of equipment items for adventuring. There are also some modifications to the level advancement system and how adventure points are gained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another change with these rules is the combat system. Along with this, weapons and armor behave differently and ranged attacks are handled like melee attacks . This different system requires less dice to roll and yet remains simple to perform. Values for weapon dice and adds, along with armor hits, remain the same but work differently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
