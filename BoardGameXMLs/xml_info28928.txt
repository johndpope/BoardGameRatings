			<description>Roller Chase&lt;br/&gt;The wildest race ever!&lt;br/&gt;Get on for the Ride!&lt;br/&gt;Board Game for ages 7 &amp;amp; up&lt;br/&gt;2 - 4 players&lt;br/&gt;Playing board 10&amp;frac12;&amp;quot; x 10&amp;frac12;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game: Be the first to go around the track, collet all four flags and return to your starting point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game comes in a small box with all the components in a yellow ziplock baggie.  The board is 6 pieces that fit together like a jigsaw.  Also included are one die, 12 stands, 12 cardboard figures (4 players (green and red girls, blue and yellow boys, in roller coaster cars) and 8 grey wild cars), and 4 flags of each colour (blue, red, green, yellow) on a perforated piece of cardboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts in one of the four corner starting points according to the colour of the roller coaster car that they have chosen.  Two wild cars (grey) per player are placed anywhere else on the track.  Each player takes turns rolling the die and moving *BOTH* their playing piece *AND* any one of the wild cars the number of spaces indicated by the die.  Wild cars bump player cars back 6 spaces.  Reach all four corners, pick up one flag of each colour, and get back to the starting point before anyone else does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
