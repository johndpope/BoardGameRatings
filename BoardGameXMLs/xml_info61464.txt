							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Artisan</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some craftspeople are more than just workers for a wage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those who are driven, who have devoted their lives to the study of a craft, an opportunity might become available to develop it further. More than just a manufacturer, they become akin to an artist in their chosen medium. Their least of constructions is as good as the master craft of other craftspeople.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They might learn one of three paths: the Arcane, the Pious or the Technical; and each in turn have advantages in terms of development and ability. Their abilities are of little value in a brawl, but they can influnce powerful people and even entire cultures by their work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The talented and driven of craftspeople are the Artisans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
