			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Learn about the exciting, mysterious and adventurous world of literature and the arts as you play this fast-paced quiz game!  Each card contains five clues.  Answer on the first clue and you earn five points.  If you answer after all five clues (including a picture clue), you still earn a point!  The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player starts by drawing a card depicting a famous artist or work of art (concealing the picture on the front and covering the clues one the back).  He or she reads the first clue the player to the left.  If that player answers, he or she earns five points.  If not, the first player reads the next clue to the next player.  This sequence continues until a player answers correctly, earning a decreasing number of points depending on how many clues have been revealed.  The final clue is the picture on the front of the card.  Once a card has been solved, the player earning the points draws the next card, and play continues until all cards are used.  The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
