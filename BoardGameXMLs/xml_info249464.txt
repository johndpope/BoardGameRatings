			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A failed test subject in one of the government's various &amp;quot;super soldier&amp;quot; experiments, Noah McNulty eventually retired from the military and set about creating a peaceful life for himself. Just as everything was looking to be going his way, he found himself among the victims of a domestic terrorist attack. Engulfed by flame, the alterations made to his body in the experiment were triggered granting him control of ice and cold. Following the terrible attack, he chose to continue protecting the innocent in a way he never could before - as the heroic SUB-ZERO MAN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
