							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Derby Downs</name>
									
			<description>A horse-racing game similar to They're at the Post.  This game uses a single double-sided record to simulate 10 different races with 10 different horses -- the needle is placed on the record and one of five tracks is available for the race.  The races are called by Chick Anderson (then official announcer of the Kentucky Derby).  Bets are paid off based on a set of official betting cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
