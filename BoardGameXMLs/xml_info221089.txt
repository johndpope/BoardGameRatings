							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fursona Unleashed</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anthros aren&amp;rsquo;t simply one species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead, the term is an umbrella for a variety of mostly interfertile, highly adaptable and exuberant hominids with bestial traits and a partially animalistic appearance. Anthros hail from every corner of the Multiverse. Some Anthro bloodlines are products of science: genetic uplifts from animal stock, while others are creatures of parallel evolution on distant worlds, or mystical hybrids created by sorcery or divine intervention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regardless of their origins, Anthros marry the natural instincts and survival adaptations of the animal kingdom with the cunning and intellect of humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fursona Unleashed is a complete and comprehensive revamp of the most popular, D20-based furry character creation system ever written! Building furry heroes with Fursona Unleashed is quicker, easier and more flexible than ever before. A new character creation system reduces book-keeping, pares down a lot of unneeded rules text, and allows for deeper, multi-faceted anthropomorphic characters. Hybrid creatures, blending the traits of multiple animal species, are easier than ever to imagine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where the first edition of Fursona defined anthropomorphic characters by their Order (the species type they belonged to), Fursona Unleashed allows for a more modular character creation. Players choose a unique ability score package for their furry hero or heroine, based on its animal nature. Size is chosen similarly, allowing for everything from Tiny rodent rogues to Huge elephant clerics or blue whale astronauts perfectly adapted for the depths of space. Finally, the player chooses several Gifts of Nature for their anthro, the amount of which is determined by the anthro&amp;rsquo;s size. Disadvantages allow the acquisition of additional Gifts of Nature, while optional templates offer further opportunities for customization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
