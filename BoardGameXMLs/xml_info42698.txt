							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trial by Fire</name>
									
			<description>Trial by Fire is a two player wargame based loosely on the Napoleonic era. The rules are simple and not intimidating for casual gamers, but there are also advanced gameplay options for seasoned wargamers. The beauty of Trial by Fire is that it doesn't get as detailed or complicated as most wargames, but still maintains the realism of battlefield decision-making. The game, still in the prototype/playtest phase of development, includes a board constructed of sheet metal and plywood; magnetic hexmap pieces; infantry, cavalry, artillery, and general markers; two card decks which determine movement and attacks; redoubts and bridges; and dice which resolve combat. The basic game is played with a random card deck, but advanced rules allow players to &amp;quot;issue orders&amp;quot; by choosing several cards at a time from their deck. Each space on the modular board is a separate magnetic hex, which allows for an almost infinite number of possible battlefields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
