							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Death Ray Manta</name>
									
			<description>Death Ray Manta (or DRM:The Videogame, no&amp;hellip; not that sort of DRM!) is a videogame. Or rather, it&amp;rsquo;s the distillation of everything we love and adore about videogames. Stripping out the cruft, stripping out the things that waste our time and leaving you with nothing but game. It&amp;rsquo;s an attempt at finding the 2 1/2 minute pop song in videogame form only lasting more than 2 1/2 minutes. Although it&amp;rsquo;s perfectly possible to let your game last only 2 1/2 minutes by dying at the 2 1/2 minute mark, I suppose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death Ray Manta is an arena shooter that knows its history. From Robotron to Llamatron to Geometry Wars and on, Death Ray Manta keeps one eye on what works, what&amp;rsquo;s worked and tries to explore it all. Quickly. In a condensed few moments of pleasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death Ray Manta is a videogame about flashing lights in your face. Very, very, pretty lights. It&amp;rsquo;s an arcade game that filters what Eugene Jarvis could have done visually given access to modern technology. Which means enormous cataclysmic explosions of rainbow colour. Often.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
