							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chairman of the Board</name>
									
			<description>Object: Become Chairman of the Board, the winner must have a minimum of 51% of the stock of his company and a minimum score of $255,000. The highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns picking up a Situation card, adding or subtracting value to the score sheet and/or move along the gameboard.  Some cards allow you to choose between increasing/decreasing your net worth or moving your playing piece forwards/backwards while other cards will have you to both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The are other squares on the gameboard which involve Conflict/Advantage cards and Corporate Investment cards. Conflict/Advantage cards are played when picked up. These cards are similar to the Situation cards but some are Advantage cards which can cause other people to lose a percent of their income, move backwards and other 'take-that' actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corporate Investment cards are kept face down and typically add to your wealth but amounts vary. They are added in towards the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents include game board, score sheet, 4 player pawns, 72 situation cards, 35 conflict/advantage cards, 30 corporate cards, and insert with the instructions on them&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
