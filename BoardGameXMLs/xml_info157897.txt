							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Morocco Ablaze: A Solitaire Game of Revolts and Uprisings in French North Africa</name>
									
			<description>BACKGROUND: MOROCCO ABLAZE is semi-historical simulation of the French Colonial Conquest of Northern Africa from 1870-1930. The Game begins shortly after a North African Tribal Leader has stirred up the natives in the whole region and are poised to launch assaults on French Settlements to drive them out of the Country forever. As the Commander of French Forces, you must protect the French Settlements and squash the rebellious Forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Game Objective: Player takes command of the French Forces in Morocco. The Player&amp;rsquo;s Objective is to attempt to control a number of Arab Settlements whose Fortification Levels (FVs) total 18 or more before the Campaign Deck is exhausted. If the Arab Army captures a number of Settlements whose Fortification Values total 18 or more, the Arabs win. Also, if the French do not control 18 FV worth of Settlements before the Campaign Deck is exhausted, the Arabs Win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
