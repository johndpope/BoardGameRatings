			<description>Playing pieces in different colors are set up on the game map in a specific fashion. Each piece has its individual target field that it has to reach. Each color also has a corresponding die; there are also grey pieces and grey dice which have a special function.&lt;br/&gt;All dice are rolled and the pieces are moved. &lt;br/&gt;The following rules apply: Large pieces cannot move onto or over small ones, not more than two pieces of the same size may be stacked, no piece can move onto or over a field without a grey piece. When the grey pieces (or one of them) can no longer move, the game is lost for all players. If the players manage to get all colored pieces to the target fields, everyone wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
