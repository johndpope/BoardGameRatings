							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">carry. a game about war.</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;carry. a game about war centers on the story of a squad of United States Marines in the Vietnam war. You take on the role of one of these soldiers, creating issues and problems that he has brought with him into the jungle. Over the course of the game, these burdens will come into conflict, hastening the squads dissolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Considering the psychological side of the war, this short-form game is designed to play out in one session, but contains enough complexity and variety that each session will be a unique experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment&lt;br/&gt;the page count  difference is due to the layout, the print and PDF versions have the same content&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
