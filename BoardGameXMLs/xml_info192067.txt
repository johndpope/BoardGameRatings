			<description>See-Schlacht is a card game based on battleship. Each player receives a couple of empty sea cards, 3 single ships (red ship cards), 1 small fleet (2 brown ship cards) and 1 large fleet (3 yellow ship cards). First each player lays out his sea cards in a grid defined by the players (e.g. 4 x 5 cards). Then each player replaces secretly empty sea cards by his ship cards. Single ships are placed by its own, fleets need to be placed on adjacent spaces. In order to trick the oponents he can also replace empty sea cards with other empty sea cards. The game consits of players taking turns in naming a card in an apponents area (e.g. 3rd row, 4th card). The named card is flipped. As sea cards have identical sides players should try to remember which cards have been named. Each player whose ships are all turned face up are out of the game. The last player with hidden ships wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
