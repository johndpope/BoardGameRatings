			<description>Contents: 4 double-sided playing pieces, 4 6-piece sturdy cardboard puzzles, a bell (&amp;aacute;la Halli Galli), gaming board, a die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player represents a pair of Moomin characters. Players are trying to build a boat by collecting 6 pieces of their puzzle. Each player starts from their own corner of the board. During your turn you roll a six-sided die and move your gaming piece clockwise around the gameboard. 1st player to collect all six pieces and get back to their starting corner sails to the lighthouse island for search of a hidden treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players get pieces for their puzzles during their own turn when they pass their starting corner or when they hit a location depicting a happy sun on the board and their gaming piece also shows a happy sun. When player hits a location that shows different sun than their gaming piece at the moment, their piece is flipped over (happy/sad).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is possible to get a piece of the puzzle during someone elses turn: The die has numbers from 1 to 5. One side has a picture of &amp;quot;Haisuli&amp;quot; eg. Stinky. Whenever this side comes up, whoever is first to hit the bell in the middle of the board (at the lighthouse island) grabs a extra piece for their puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, it is possible to lose already collected puzzle pieces when you hit a sad sun and your gaming piece also shows a sad sun or when you hit another players starting corner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game of The Year 2007 Childrens Game finalist in Finland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
