			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Children work together to solve world and human problems presents in a simplified way. Good for a small or large group. Children are divided into simulated social groups ( tribes, nations, etc. ) Each group gets Problem Cards &amp;amp;amp; a share of Solution Cards. Through discussion, trade agreements, world councils... the players try to solve all the problems facing them. The debriefing session at the end allows for everyone to learn from each other. Our most popular group game! Good for repeated uses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
