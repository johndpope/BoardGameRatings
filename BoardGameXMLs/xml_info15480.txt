							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zig-Zag Zoom</name>
									
			<description>Each player takes their turn rolling their colored balls, one at a time. Players attempt to make their ball zigzag around scoring holes in an attempt to have it drop in the hole farthest to the end. Scoring holes range in point value as follows: 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10. A gutter around the sides is worth no points for those who roll their balls with too much speed. It takes skill and practice, or a lot of luck to score 10 points in one roll. Player with the most points after 5 rounds is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
