							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Gods Help Us</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We all know him. He's the player who's never satisfied with the core classes of any rulebook. The one who likes to play the most inane race he can find and inadvertently create both headaches and hilarity for the GM and his fellow players. This book is for him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Gods Help Us is a lighthearted collection of new White Star classes for that one player who just has to be different. It contains twelve (12) quirky race/class combinations including giant cockroach junkers, spiritual mammoths, living oozes, malfunctioning lawbots, zombie crewmen, and other bizarre creatures that will leave you shaking your head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Include them as playable races or insert them into your White Star campaign as comic relief and have your players begging the Star Gods for help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Gods Help Us was designed for use with White Star: White Box Science Fiction Roleplaying, but can be easily adapted to any Space Fantasy campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
