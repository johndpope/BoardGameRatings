			<description>This word card game has 108 cards, most with a letter and value (1-9), except for two wild cards with value zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt 10 cards.  In their turn, a player may: form a new word from their hand; add from their hand to either end of a word already on the table; discard any number of their cards to the bottom of the draw pile; or pass.  If they played or added to a word, they score all points in the word, then draw back up to 10.  If a wild card is on the table, and they have a card for the letter it stands for, they may swap it for the wild card, at the start of their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play ends when the draw pile is exhausted and one player exhausts his hand or everyone passes in turn.  The values of the cards in hand are subtracted from the scores, and the highest wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
