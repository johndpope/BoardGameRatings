			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Holdenshire is a peaceful county.  Ruled by Lord Pemberton, the villages of Hengistbury and Thornbury exist in a friendly rivalry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winter is over, and Hengistbury is experiencing a warm, dry Spring. The summer county fair is already being organized, the Fair Committee headed as always by Lady Sybill Pemberton, and the village is its usual bustling, cheerful self.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All is not well, however. There have been problems of late! Children have been disappearing into the Weirwood; howls of an unearthly nature have been echoing across the Fogmoor; and Three-Fingered Jake, the county&amp;rsquo;s itinerant bard, has been speading rumors of treasure and hauntings in the ruins of Brockendale Castle.  And that&amp;rsquo;s not to mention the lizardmen aggression or the bandits upriver!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All this aside, however, tonight is a warm, balmy evening. Many of the villagers are gathered in and outside the Bleeding Heart Tavern (originally called the Beaming Hearth, until some children vandalized the pub&amp;rsquo;s sign), and any troubles seem far away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, except for that dragon in Skull Mountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you remember D&amp;amp;D adventures which consisted solely of trekking to a dragon&amp;rsquo;s lair and slaying it, old-school style?  Have you fond memories of the NIGHT BELOW boxed set &amp;ndash; in particular the first book which details the area of Haranshire and the various goings-on there?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you love the idea of a small village setting, detailed with various plot hooks and sub-quests, followed by a good-old fashioned hex-crawl and a dragon slaying, this adventure is for you!  It&amp;rsquo;s NIGHT BELOW crossed with THE HOBBIT.  Kinda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s simple.  It&amp;rsquo;s old-school. We&amp;rsquo;re not talking elaborate motivations, complex plots, or a dragon with a 12-page statblock and a lair which requires a degree to run well.  We&amp;rsquo;re talking some sandboxy quests, a lengthy wilderness trek, a bit of a dungeon-crawl, then a straightforward, stand-up fight with a dragon.  And lots and lots of treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
