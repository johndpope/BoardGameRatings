							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Sixty-Six</name>
									
			<description>This undated game from Rosebud Art Co. is a spin-and-move game with a mathematical twist that is not nearly as easy as it looks. The board consists of five concentric circles of numbers connected by paths. There are four color-coded spaces in the corners and four matching spaces numbered 66 at the center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number spaces range from minus 9 to plus 8. The spinner is unusual - it has 12 outcomes that include 2 x 0, 3 x 1, 2 x 2, 2 x 3, and one each of 4, 5 and 6. The rules say that after making a spin, each player must move his token that number of spaces, forwards, back or sideways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player must add or subtract the number in each space he passes or reaches and keep a cumulative total from one turn to the next. The winner is the first to successfully reach the 66 space of their color with a cumulative total of exactly 66.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A copy of the game from renowned collector Alex G. Malloy's estate includes a hand-written attribution of the cover art to Palmer Cox, the Canadian artist famous for his books and comics about Brownies. As Cox died in 1924, this implies an early-to-mid 1920s publication date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
