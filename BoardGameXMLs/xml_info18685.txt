							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Comical Game of Who?</name>
									
			<description>This game includes 60 cards; each with an answer on the top, number in the middle and a question on the bottom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards bearing uneven numbers are divided among the men or boys. The even numbers are divided among the ladies or girls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player holding Number One card begins the game by reading the question on that card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player holding the Number Two card reads reads the answer at the top, getting up and making a courtesy as she does so. She then reads her question at the foot of the card, and Number Three reads his answer, standing up and bowing as he does so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proceed thus until all the cards are read. The answer to the question on card Number Sixty being read by Number One.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Per the rules: &amp;quot;The fun caused by the ridiculous questions and answers can be imagined when the game is played by a lively company.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
