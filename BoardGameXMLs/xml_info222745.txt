			<description>Dernier Episode (&amp;quot;Last Issue&amp;quot;), a retired superhero story telling game where the players invent their own superhero, then tell stories on how they caught supervilains in their young days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Create the incredible story of your own superhero and retell his or her greatest fights against a multitude of supervillains! Invent crazy adventures by picking random tokens and contest your opponents&amp;rsquo; stories to make fun of their heroes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of a game, each players are given 2 origins and 2 superpowers. They each choose a combo of 1 origin, and 1 superpower.  They then one by one present their superhero to the other players by name, origin and superpower. It can either be very detailed, or simply naming the cards. This gives a feel about the game to new players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then supervillains are displayed face up on the table. On his turn, a player chooses a supervillain, and starts telling the story of how his superhero stopped him from accomplishing one of the two machiavellic plans displayed on the supervillain card.&lt;br/&gt;He puts his hands in the tokens bag, and pulls out randomly a number of tokens equal to the supervillain difficulty level. (1 to 3) and throws them on the table and turns the hourglass.  These token have random pictures on them, and the player must tell the story of how his superheroe stopped the supervillain mentionning his superpower, and his story must include all the randomly selected tokens. Other players may play one of their special tokens to add an additionnal random token to the story if they feel it's going to be too easy, and after the player finishes his story, they can also play special token to contest his story by either telling that it's the other players superhero who really did the job, and that this players version was not the truth, or that the superhero was beated by the supervillain and lost his encounter. To do so, they turn over the tokens to reveal new pictures, and tell their stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After that, player vote for the best story, and the winning player gets the supervillain card.  If the supervillain won, the cards goes back at the center of the table, and is available to be picked again by the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has gathered a given number of supervillains (depending on the number of players), he picks 3 cards from the retirement deck, and chooses one to play with one last story with the same rules above, but adding how this adventure ended his life a sa super hero and went into retirement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player retires, every other players also tell one last story the same way, then we count the difficulty values of the supervillains taken by each players. The one with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
