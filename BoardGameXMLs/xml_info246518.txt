							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kill Them All</name>
									
			<description>The time is now for us to rid the world of a greatly annoying creature that is the bane of human life as we know it. Emojis are so stupid, and really hard to kill. Even so... Kill them. Kill Them All.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How To Play&lt;br/&gt;Separate all 12 Emoji cards from the deck. Shuffle these cards and deal 3 to all players, face-up, in front of them. Set aside extra Emojis. Shuffle the remaining deck and set it face-down between all players. A discard pile exists beside it. The player to the dealer's left has first turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each turn, players draw up to 4 cards (the hand limit) from the deck (or discard pile, or both), and play any number of Weapon cards into the spaces below the 3 Emoji cards that (and only if they) list them. When all Weapons listed on an Emoji have been played, flip it over, as it is dead, and place the weapons used to kill it under the discard pile, to be reused later. If a player is unable to play a Weapon on an Emoji during a turn, one must be played on an opponent's Emoji of his or her choice. If neither are possible, the player must show his or her hand to all. To end a turn, 1 card is discarded (if possible). If the deck exhausts, reuse the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use Special Action cards by playing them onto the discard pile (from where they may not be drawn).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first to kill all of his or her Emojis, wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
