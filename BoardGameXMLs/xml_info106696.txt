							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Achron</name>
									
			<description>From the official website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Achron is a futuristic RTS featuring three species with vastly different playing styles where you create your buildings and army, explore the map, expand to acquire more resources, upgrade your tech tree, and engage in combat with your foes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like many other games, Achron allows the player to view an overhead map of the surrounding area. However, Achron also shows a map of the timeline. If the player is attacked at a certain point in time, the timeline will show the amount of damage received at that point by a large amount of red on that portion of the timeline. The timeline also shows information including damage dealt and chronoports. Being able to see the amount of available resources at any point in time helps the player figure out the best points in time to construct more units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
