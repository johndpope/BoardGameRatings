			<description>Inside the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 4 boards, each with the letters of the alphabet&lt;br/&gt;- 100 subject cards &lt;br/&gt;- timer&lt;br/&gt;- 110 chips&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Idea of the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To fill one's own board as quick as possible. Player gets a subject and timer starts. Player tries to say as many words as possible from the given subject in given time. Simultaneously the player covers up the letter on his board with a chip. For example: if the subject is animals in jungle, the players says &amp;quot;ape&amp;quot; and covers letter 'A' in the board. Then the player says &amp;quot;elephant&amp;quot; and covers the letter 'E' and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It sounds easy but the time is limited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
