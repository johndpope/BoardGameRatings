			<description>Wicked Wickets is a cricket based table game suitable for the whole family, cricketers and non-cricketers alike, and can accommodate anything from two to twenty-two players. The game involves selection, bowling, batting, and active fielding, allowing for short over fast action games through to the complex realms of strategy found in test play. Although, like with cricket itself, the basics are simple and easily learnt, it will inevitably take a lifetime to master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No prior knowledge of cricket is needed to play the game which is suitable for the whole family and up to 22 players. In essence the side that scores the most &amp;quot;runs&amp;quot; wins, though selecting the right players, the order they play, and where they are positioned all affect the outcome of the game. The basics of Wicked Wickets are really quite simple; the bowler throws the ball, in this case the red ball shaped die, and the batsman &amp;quot;hits&amp;quot; it by throwing the buff bat-shaped die. Adding the scores together shows how far the ball goes using the long flight measure. If the batsman's score is higher than the bowlers, the ball &amp;quot;flies&amp;quot; in the air; if the bowler's score is higher than the batsman's, then it is struck along the ground. The yellow counter and dice are used to show which direction the ball goes. The short pace measure is simply used to measure the distance players move and the green die is mostly used for fielding. The game cards give the individual abilities of the players affecting how and where they are used. However, as with most games there is often more to it than first meets the eye. --From the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Official website: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boadiceasbackyard.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boadiceasbackyard.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
