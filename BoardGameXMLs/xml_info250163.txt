							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">50 Modern Day People, Set 2</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every modern day setting needs people&amp;hellip; even common average ones in the background. Though sometimes the assumed gender and a name might be enough, the players are usually going to want to know more. This set of 50 folks delivers just that. Each roll of the die reveals the first and last name of a person as well as their age. After that, there&amp;rsquo;s a brief description&amp;ndash; often this description will indicate their occupation and/or what they are currently doing with their lives. Sometimes the information gets a bit more interesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
