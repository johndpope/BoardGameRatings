							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Escorsen&#039;s Hermitage</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escorsen's hermitage is deep in the Leonese Marshes on the eastern side of the Island of Melderyn. The setting is simple and isolated, typical for the dwelling of a hermit. People who have encountered Escorsen have described him as a slightly eccentric Ilviran priest. But Escorsen is not all that he seems; those few who suspected he was other than he let on are no longer among the living. &lt;br/&gt; The Escorsen's Hermitage article describes Escorsin of Tenir (including H&amp;acirc;rnMaster stats), his hermitage, and the barrow graves in the surrounding marshes. It includes full-color GM and player maps as well as floor plans for the hermitage buildings and a barrow grave.&lt;br/&gt; This is a H&amp;acirc;rn Classics article and was originally published in 1987 as part of Hârnlore 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
