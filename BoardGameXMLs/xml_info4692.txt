			<description>Meistertrick is a game in which two players try to outsmart each other in a game of numbers.  Each player arranges blocks numbered 1 to 8 on their side of the game tray, keeping the arrangement hidden from the opponent.  Both sides then reveal their blocks; the lower number of each pair of opposing blocks in a row is discarded.  The next round continues with the reduced number of blocks.  The game reaches its conclusion when a player has been reduced to a single block or 6 rounds have been played.  The winner is the one who has the most number of blocks left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
