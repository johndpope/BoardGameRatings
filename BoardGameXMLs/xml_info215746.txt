			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oszt&amp;aacute;lytal&amp;aacute;lkoz&amp;oacute; is a nostalgic and black-humorous card game from the socialist era of Hungary, where the players are old classmates, and after a long-long time they arrive to their class reunion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With cards everybody tells what they have archieved since their graduation in trick-taking turns. Who shows the most valuable property wins the turn, earn the points on the cards and activate a special ability of the card category (vehicle, real estate, stuff, food). Every player tries to earn as many points as he can, but everybody has an own line of limit, and if he passes that point, he lives like a bourgeois, the men of state are arriving and he is kicked out of the game. At the beginning of the game the players draw (or choose by bid in the advanced game) a job card which can help to find the best strategy and add extra abilities to the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oszt&amp;aacute;lytal&amp;aacute;lkoz&amp;oacute; is a fast-placed card game with the base of trick-taking games, but it adds not only the special abilities on the property cards and the characters but the line of limit. It has been drawn by the socialist state, and it is an other rule what twists the well-known mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
