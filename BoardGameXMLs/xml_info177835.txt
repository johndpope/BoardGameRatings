							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Magno-Star</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Advanced Class for the Galaxy Command Campaign Setting&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magno-Star is the hottest sport of the 35th Century- a fast-moving, thrilling, three dimensional combination of soccer and rugby played by technologically enhanced magnetic manipulators. The first Magno-Star leagues started up during the 32nd Century, by bored ore miners on the remote colony world IronClad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four hundred day planetary night on the remote mining world was long and arctic, but nothing outside the tolerances of the tough, cyber-enhanced colonists. What 32nd Century cyber tech couldn&amp;rsquo;t fix, though, was boredom. When off duty, the colonists needed something to keep their minds occupied: the local VR chambers got old after a while, and IronClad was too remote for regular imports of booze. So the miners found a disused shaft, and refitted their work-suits and cyber-implants to have a little fun. A few thousand bruises and broken bones later, actual rules were laid down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, Magno-Star is a multi-trillion credit sport. Every world in civilized space has a local team, and virtually every citizen of Galaxy Command bets on big matches. The sport of today is fast moving and high tech, and its supped-up stars are revered as some of the galaxy&amp;rsquo;s greatest heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
