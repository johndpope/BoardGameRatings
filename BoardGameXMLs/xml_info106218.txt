			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Drive on Moscow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;22 June, 1941: the world stood poised on the greatest campaign in military history. At the Soviet Union's border, Germany and her allies had amassed 19 Panzer, 14 Motorized and 120 regular Infantry divisions. Facing them stood 111 Rifle, 47 Tank, 7 Mountain and 8 Cavalry divisions of the ill-prepared Red Army. By the end of the monumental campaign casualties had soared into the millions, and while the Russian campaign was not the sole cause of the downfall of Hitler's Third Reich, it was undoubtably the major factor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Panzers East! faithfully recreates the immense problems the German High Command faced on the eastern front during World War II. A solitaire game with area movement, you, as the German commander, direct the entire Axis invasion force. The air war is also realistically detailed, giving you options for Combat Air Patrol (CAP), escort missions as well as strafing and bombing attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Panzers East! covers the first year of the war. Despite your overwhelming forces (at least at the start), time is not on your side. You have a scant 24 weeks to take your pre-determined objectives. You must carefully juggle your units: keeping enough at the front to push the Soviets back while at the same time garrisoning captured areas adequately to keep partisan activity at a minimum. Finally, there is the devastating effects of &amp;quot;Mother Russia's&amp;quot; mud and snow. The result is a tense simulation of the psychological and military aspects of this grueling campaign's initial year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing time: 1 to 3 hours.&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: 6&lt;br/&gt;(on a scale of 1-introductory; 10-advanced)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
