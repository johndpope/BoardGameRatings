			<description>Players roll dice and walk around a large game board. On each square they land, they have to fulfill certain tasks. However, when they have to draw an event card, for example, they can choose to use it immediately or at any point later. To win, all cards must have been played. During the game, players also have to collect 15 objects (hotels, airlines etc.). And lastly, the winner needs to have at least 100 million dollars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
