			<description>This game is quite unique with its theme as it is about motor-cross, a discipline that game publishers typically overlook. The goal is to reach the finish first and to score the maximum number of points. Each player either controls 1 or 2 motor-cross bikes. Each team has a budget and the races consists of 2 matches, the winner is the player who has scored the highest number of points over the 2 matches. Apart from dice, the game also consists of cards and a 34 x 47 cm. board. Vintage game from the '80s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
