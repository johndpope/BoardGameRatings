							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Fall: The Journal</name>
									
			<description>Dark Fall is a British first-person horror-adventure game which was independently released on June 4, 2002 by XXv Productions. It was released worldwide (and re-released in the UK) by The Adventure Company in 2003 with the title Dark Fall: The Journal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Fall uses a simple point-and-click interface to move the player around and manipulate the environment. The player has a basic inventory which - due to the game's puzzle-based nature - only ever holds a few items. The player spends most of the game solving the numerous puzzles (such as translating an encrypted message, or opening a puzzle box) to find a myriad of symbols, the use for which eventually becomes apparent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contrary to a lot of modern adventure games, Dark Fall does not keep note of any information or clues to puzzles that the player comes across during the game, effectively forcing the player to keep track of every puzzle or detail themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dark Fall: The Journal&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
