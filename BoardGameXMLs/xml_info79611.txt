			<description>Wing Commander: Privateer is an adventure space flight simulation computer game released by Origin Systems in 1993. Privateer and its storyline is part of the Wing Commander series. Privateer had an add-on titled Righteous Fire (1994) that continues the story and adds other purchasable equipment to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The software features a pseudo-3D world in plain raster graphics at 320x200 with 256 colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes the role of Grayson Burrows, a &amp;quot;privateer&amp;quot; who travels through the Gemini Sector, one of many sectors in the Wing Commander universe. Unlike Wing Commander, the player is no longer a navy pilot, but a freelancer who can choose to be a pirate, a merchant, a mercenary or any of the above in some combination. The player may follow the built-in plot but is free to adventure on his own, even after the plot has been completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Wing Commander: Privateer , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
