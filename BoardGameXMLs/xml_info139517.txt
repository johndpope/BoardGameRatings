			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protect a city by attempting to dismantle enemy warships before they can begin their attack. Move around large enemy ships armed with a saw while you and your crew attempt to evade ship defenses as you cut it apart. When you cut off a part of the ship it will fall to the ground, your goal is to make the ship 5% of its starting size. You can also use bombs and gain powerups for special attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
