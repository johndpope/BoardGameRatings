			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Golden Tee 2011 unplugged is a similar edition to the Golden Tee Live 2011 version of the long running Golden Tee series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unplugged is meant for home or casual arcade play. It does not offer any of the Live play features like on-line tournaments updates, etc. It also has easier winds, ball drops, pin placement and tee off spots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game follows the normal rules for golf play. All scoring is done for stroke play (hazards, water penalties etc.) You are provided with a standard set of clubs. 2-9 irons, 3 and 5 woods and a driver. Sand and pitch wedge and a putter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior to the swing you can turn left or right. By rolling the roller ball (controller) back in a certain direction (for backswing) then foward in a certain direction, you can accomplish different shots including slices, hooks, fades and knock down shots.  There is also a backspin button to allow backspin on the green.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also keeps track of high scores for each course including:&lt;br/&gt;-the thirty best scores -Great golfer points (scored by getting shots within 5' of the hole from at least 50 yards out)&lt;br/&gt;-longest drive&lt;br/&gt;-longest putt&lt;br/&gt;-fewest putts&lt;br/&gt;-most greens hit&lt;br/&gt;-most fairways hit&lt;br/&gt;-most birdies&lt;br/&gt;-most eagles or better&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
