			<description>Broadway is a tableau laying game for four players (two partnerships, with partners sitting opposite) using a double-six set of dominos.  The goal of the game is to have the most points, points are scored each turn where a player lays a tile that matches more than one individual tile segment already on the tableau.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game is played over a series of seven hands, with each hand&amp;rsquo;s tableau building upon a double. The first hand starts with the double six, and successive hands continue on down to double blank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each hand, thoroughly shuffle the tiles face-down. Each player then draws seven tiles. The player having the double corresponding to the current hand leads it face-up to the center of the table, oriented horizontally from his point of view. Thereafter, each player, in turn, places one tile from his hand onto the table, face-up and oriented horizontally from his point of view, such that at least one segment of the played tile matches at least one tile segment that is already part of the tableau. The tableau usually takes on an irregular, blob-like shape and need not remain closepacked; unusual shapes and enclosed empty spaces of any size are both acceptable. Not all segments need to match, but the more that do, the more points the play is worth. One matched segment (the most common play) scores nothing. Two matched segments score one point for the partnership that played it. Three matched segments score five points. Four or more matched segments score ten points. Points are recorded as they are made during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(from the rules found on pagat.com)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
