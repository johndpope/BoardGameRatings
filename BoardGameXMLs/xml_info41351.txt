			<description>A Monopoly like game, where players try to gather as much money as possible during the game. Duration is variable, with players deciding at the start of the game what the criteria is for the game ending (amount of money, elapsed time etc.) A single track runs round the board with four off-shots (trade, car-trade, fishery and stock exchange) at each corner. Players can buy lots and build properties and inflation plays part in whether they can sell their properties with profit or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
