							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">My Daughter, The Queen of France</name>
									
			<description>From the text:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My Daughter, the Queen of France is a game about what it means to grow apart from the things you have made, and the efforts and contortions we go through to reconcile ourselves to that inevitable division. You will need at least three people to play the game, and no more than five. You will also need some paper and a pencil for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story of the game revolves around the estrangement of William Shakespeare from his daughter. Upset and confused, the playwright struggles to answer the questions surrounding their falling out: why did it happen? who was at fault? what happened to the daughter he thought he knew, and to the life he imagined for her? Scenes from their life &amp;ndash; together and apart &amp;ndash; repeat themselves in his head, but different every time, so that he can never be sure what really happened, or why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
