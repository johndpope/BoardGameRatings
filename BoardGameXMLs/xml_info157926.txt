			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the seventh issue of Going Postal, a series of supplements for the Mutant Future role-playing game by Goblinoid Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue introduces the Robot player character. Built upon the framework of Robots found in the Mutant Future Revised Rulebook, including two different methods of building your own robot character from the ground up. Random Generation tables are included for robotic frames, locomotion, manipulation, sensors, and accessories and a point buy system is also given for those players that would like more control over their robot's design. Two robot examples are given, one built using the random generation method and the other using the point buy system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF is book-marked and includes layers so that the backgrounds can be turned off for ease of printing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
