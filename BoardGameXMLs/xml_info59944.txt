			<description>The game is well suited for music students in the classroom setting. The players will need instruction on music history and common instruments throughout the world or previous knowledge in order for the game to be challenging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board resembles an overhead view of an orchestra, with labels for each instrumental section: Strings, Brass, Woodwind, Lutes and Percussion. The player must move through each section by answering questions regarding the instruments in that section. The Maestro Square is the connecting square between sections. After successfully answering a question in a section, the player receives a card representing the completed section. Thus, the game is a race game with the winner being the first person to collect at least one card from each section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;    *  Game board&lt;br/&gt;    * 1 Die&lt;br/&gt;    * Game Markers&lt;br/&gt;    * Question Cards (Instrument and Maestro)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
