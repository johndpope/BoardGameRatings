			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This WWII miniatures rules set is subtitled Simple Fast Play Wargame Rules for the Western Desert 1940-43. The rules cover British action in North Africa. It indeed does use a simple d6 driven resolution system and contains rules for melee, weapons fire, and morale. Game uses a centimeter scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;For a good part of the Second World War Britain's main contribution to the Allied cause on land was in the Western Desert of North Africa. For a long time is was the only point where Britain was in land contact with the Axis powers, fighting first against the Italians and then against the Germans and Italians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following rules are as simple and fast moving as I have been able to make them, they are designed for relatively large-scale actions involving fairly large numbers of figures and AFV models.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules set appears in Wargames Illustrated #76 (January 1994)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
