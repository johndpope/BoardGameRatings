			<description>Color-Combi is an abstract card placement game for 2-5 players.  The game is comprised of 70 square cards, each containing a multi-colored cross, and five sets of colored tokens, representing up to five players. The game is housed in a cardboard box with color printed top and unprinted bottom.  The box contains a plastic tray to hold the cards and the tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt two cards, and the remaining cards form a draw pile.  The first player draws a blind card and then lays one card from their hand face up on the table.  Playing clockwise, each player takes a turn, drawing a card and playing a card on the table.  Cards must be placed, edge to edge, so the colors match.  Players must place a card if they are able, but rows of cards cannot exceed three cards in length.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to create squares of cards and claim them with the colored tokens.  Additionally, your can seize an existing square if you are able to replace one of the cards on the table with a card from your hand.  The first player to claim four squares wins.  There are additional rules for a points game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
