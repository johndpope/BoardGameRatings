							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rails West!</name>
									
			<description>From Publisher Catalog:&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1870.  Just a year ago, the Union Pacific and the Central Pacific met in Utah to complete the first great Transcontinental.  Now, RAILS WEST! gives you the chance to personally experience the exciting but risky nature of railroad development in the West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By raising money from banks or by selling stocks, you can start your own railroad company.  Or you can buy enough shares of an existing corporation to gain control.  No matter how you choose to play the game, its name is money.  Your goal is to maximize your financial holdings any way you can.  Just make sure you don't overextend yourself or run yourself into bankruptcy.  Remember, there ain't no such thing as Chapter 11 back then!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hi-Res color map of the West lets you watch the building of the railroad lines.  The computer generates accounts and railroad operations statistics as needed.  Up to eight companies (players) can be accommodated, with as many as four computer-controlled if desired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by historian Martin Campion, RAILS WEST! is not just fun, it's also educational!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
