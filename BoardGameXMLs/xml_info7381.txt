							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Das Spitzweg-Spiel</name>
									
			<description>The game is based on the paintings of a quite famous german artist, Carl Spitzweg. Therefore 80 big playing-cards with pictures of the artist are the main part of the components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher of the game is a company named Belser, but looking at the box it's quite obvious that this company seems to be just a branch of Kosmos (and the author Fritz Kruber is a Kosmos editor).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to build exhibitions with the paintings of the master. All players work at the same exhibition by placing cards towards it following special rules. The exhibition is closed (and points are awarded) once a certain amount of pictures have been added - then a new exhibition starts until the deck runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game feels a bit like Rummy meets Scrabble (without words...) with a few twists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
