			<description>The instructional objective of the card game is for students to practice using Spanish vocabulary in comprehensible sentences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck needs to be shuffled, then placed face down and separated. The first player turns over two cards. If one card is a vocabulary word that correctly fits into a sentence of the other card (for example sun and When it's hot, the _____ shines in the sky), the player gets to keep both cards and continue with his/her turn until he/she doesn't find a matching pair. If the cards do not match, the player must turn the cards face down again and the next player takes a turn. The rest of the players continue the game in the same manner.&lt;br/&gt;The game is played until all the cards have been matched and there are no remaining cards. The winner is the person with the most cards at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;32 cards&lt;br/&gt;Sixteen of the cards will contain a single vocabulary word. The other 16 cards will contain a sentence with a blank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
