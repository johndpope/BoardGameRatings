			<description>Plunge into the glittering sea to recover exotic treasures from a seafloor overflowing with pirate shipwrecks. Send your divers to the deep, but be careful; moving too close to other divers lets them get in on the haul too! Gather lost loot and beached baubles to assemble museum exhibits and construct eye-popping aquariums... but don't forget to save the best bits for your personal collection!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wreck Raiders is an innovative dice-drafting worker placement system. Choose a die from the pool, then send one of your divers to any spot on the board with that number. But be warned: the spot you choose will help any diver in the spots next to you, whether they&amp;rsquo;re friendly or not. Will you risk letting a rival in on your haul to get that treasure you want, or can you find a way to grab yourself some extra loot?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Display your treasures to build museum exhibits, or send them to your vault for huge scoring opportunities... Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to visit the beach nearby to gather washed-up baubles and spend them to build awesome aquariums. (All sea creatures are treated ethically and released into the wild; also, they are cardboard tiles.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the game ends, you&amp;rsquo;ll earn coins for your exhibits, your vault, and your aquariums. The player with the most coins wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
