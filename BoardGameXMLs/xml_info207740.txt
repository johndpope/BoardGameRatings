							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Shroomkin</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The origins of the mysterious fungal humanoid race known as shroomkin, called fungimen or&lt;br/&gt;shroomen by others, is still a mystery even to the greatest of scholars (which prefer to refer to them as myconoids).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite their mysterious origins all scholars can agree that the shroomkin share a great deal&lt;br/&gt;with fungus and mushrooms (hence their name), biologically at least, their bodies as diverse as any mushroom you have encountered. Most of them possess caps, gills on the underside of their caps, and their bodies are composed of the same leathery materials as a mushroom&amp;rsquo;s stem, some shroomkin warriors however develop chitinous tissue. All of them can release spores, each spore containg a different effect such as turning dead bodies into food, controlling other creatures, causing extreme pain, and even spores that puts their target to sleep. They may be small but they have all the tools they need to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains two files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A 21 page playbook containing over 20 moves, gear, poisons, transportation, and magic items.&lt;br/&gt;    A compendium class: The Fungilord&lt;br/&gt;    A two page character sheet for you to record your character's stats, gear, and moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
