							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">I Have a Bible Secret</name>
									
			<description>Players take turns answering questions about characters from the Bible. Ten clues are provided on each card. Ten points are given for the correct answer on the first clue, nine for the second, eight for the third, etc. However, no set amount of points for victory is specified in the rules; perhaps that's the Bible Secret in question. As Ned Flanders might say, see how long it takes you to answer 100 points worth of Bible questions, then try to break that record.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From box front:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Leisure time activities that sharpen the mind and improve the character are true Christian recreation.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
