							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">One-on-One Leverage</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Next time y'all call me, it better be for something easy, like faking a moon landing.&amp;quot; --Alec Hardison, The Bottle Job&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some nights it's just you and that special someone. Or the other players all got held up... literally or figuratively. What's a dynamic duo of LEVERAGE gamers to do? How about some one-on-one gaming? Included are rules and techniques for on-on-one Leverage play, with one player and one Fixer. We introduce the Con, a jack-of-all-trades Role that handles anything a crew of cons in traditional Leverage could do. Also provided is advice for the Fixer on how to make a game work when everything comes down to one character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the ninth in a new series of monographs featuring new rules and game support for the LEVERAGE ROLEPLAYING GAME based on the hit TV show on TNT. Officially licensed for your own private CrimeWorld!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
