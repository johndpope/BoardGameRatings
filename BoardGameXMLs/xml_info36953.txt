			<description>Barons to Kings is a tile laying game where players build roads to gain movement and capture markets to earn needed funds.  Players build fleets and walls to protect their property while trying to avoid other players and the plague.  Battle takes place with cards and dice. &lt;br/&gt; Each player picks a flag on one of the 4 corners of the game board.  This spot will be their starting point for every move they make.  Gold tile pieces represent various coinage of the age.   Gold tiles are the only way to buy new Military, Road &amp;amp; Wall pieces from the center pile which you will need to survive.  The only way to get more gold is to get a military unit to one of the Market Squares in the middle of the board &amp;amp; hold it.&lt;br/&gt;Once your empire is built, you will expand towards the other players and begin to conquer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
