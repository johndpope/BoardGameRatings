			<description>A football (Soccer) board game.  Players use a die to move either a player, players, or the ball.  Simple game that does deal with items such as tackling, offsides and shootouts.  Goals depend on where the shot is taken from and results from a card.  The board looks very similar to StreetSoccer but predates it by 10 years.  This is also a 5 on 5 game and comes in various boxes depending on where you bought it.  There's a Manchester United version and a few others as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
