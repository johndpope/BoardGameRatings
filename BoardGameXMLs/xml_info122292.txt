			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a new collectible RPG in a Golden Age Superheroes vein: to play, you just need any set of the playbooks, with at least one per player. Each playbook gives you a pre-made character and all the rules needed to play them or to run the game for others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exclusive story: the Secret Origin of... Photus!&lt;br/&gt;When a super-advanced robot space probe was exposed to a solar storm on a test flight in orbit, it became much more than it&amp;rsquo;s inventors had ever imagined! Returning to Earth with its newly acquired sentience and superpowers, it continues to pursue its mission: to seek out answers, collect data and perhaps solve the ultimate conundrum... can a Machine become a Man?!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
