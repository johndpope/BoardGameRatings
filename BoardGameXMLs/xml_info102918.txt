			<description>Hurry Up! is a game for the whole family&lt;br/&gt;Play from 2 to 8 players and much more per team!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Hurry Up!, before the buzzer rings, the players have to name 1 or 2 things from a random theme that have to start with a letter requested!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preparation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before starting the game, you have to determine the number of players or teams by clicking on the appropriate number. Each player or team goes in front of one of the squares. Now the game can start!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all the players are ready, press the central button &amp;quot;Go&amp;quot; to start the first round. The arrow turns and stops at a random player or team. The participant pointed at has to name 1 or 2 things of the requested theme starting with a random letter. If the participant answers correctly, he presses quickly the central circle and the turn goes to another player or team. When the buzzer rings, the player or the team that had to answer loses the round and 1 point (each player or team starts the game with 5 points). When the score of a player or team falls to 0, they are removed from the game. The winner is the last player or last team that has at least 1 point left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example: The arrow stops at you and you have to name &amp;quot;a four letter word beginning with the letter S&amp;quot;. Say &amp;quot;Song&amp;quot; for example and then press quickly the central circle to give the turn to another player (unless the other players do notice you that your answer is wrong! In this case, suggest a different answer corresponding to the theme and letter requested).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are allowed to help other participants if they wish. When you have to say the name of a famous person starting with the letter R for example, you can either say the first name or the surname or both if they start with the letter R. If you want to make the game more difficult, you can decide to take into account only the surname of the famous person. The articles are not taken into account. For example, if you say &amp;quot;The Godfather&amp;quot;, the letter G of &amp;quot;Godfather&amp;quot; is taken into account and not the letter T of &amp;quot;The&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
