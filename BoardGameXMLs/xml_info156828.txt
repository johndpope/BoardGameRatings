			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From limitless worlds arise uncountable threats, from hordes of faceless enemies to powerful archons of intrigue and conspiracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Echoes of the Typhonians reveals a threat that extends across countless worlds, one that has until now gone unnoticed. As one antagonist rises, another remarkably similar foe emerges in a distant world. One after the other, these individuals make their presence known, forming plans of their own devising &amp;mdash; yet as one grows in power, another vanishes as suddenly as he appears. Mighty generals, world-shaking sorcerers, and timeless librarians, each with one thing in common: a unique destiny that may bring ruin to the Gossamer worlds and all who hold them dear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Echoes of the Typhonians includes new rules, story hooks, and campaign suggestions centering around the Usari, a mysterious race that may hold the keys to the ancient secrets of the Typhonians. Who are they, and what is their ultimate fate?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
