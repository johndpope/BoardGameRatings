			<description>From the game's introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Archipelago is a story/role-playing game where each player controls a major character. Players take turns directing and playing out a part of their character's story, leading them towards their selected point of destiny, while other players interact with and influence that story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who is this game for?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you like the story-telling part of games, and enjoy the creative challenge and inspiration that comes from working with others, this game is for you. If you like tactical mechanics, resource management, or player-vs-player competition, there are other games that might work better for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vibe I'm aiming for&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I wrote this game trying to capture the feeling of Ursula K. LeGuin's Earthsea books. I wanted a game of grand destinies, that at the same time had time to dwell on the details of plants, words, everyday lives. I wanted a game that was about great conflicts, but at the same time treated its characters' stories with respect. I wanted not a steel framework, but a spider web of thin threads creating subtler stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game works best if you play it slow. Sometimes, the best thing to do is wait a little and see how things unfold. Ged stayed with Ogion for years, learning about the old language, the names of flower petals and bugs. There's time to let the characters evolve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breathe in. Breathe out. Take your time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
