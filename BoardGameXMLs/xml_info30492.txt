							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Black Hole Explorer</name>
									
			<description>Black Hole Explorer is an interesting children's game about building a rocket to travel to and study a black hole. The game is designed to be light-hearted, educational and fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in three steps:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First construct your ship using what funds you have available -- $10 million to $60 million. Your ship must have probes, radiation shielding, gravitational strength and power to drive your spaceship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And, don't forget to name your spaceship!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next, travel to the black hole and enter into a low enough orbit with it to launch your probes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are spaces around the black hole to draw Event cards that may help or hinder your mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, escape the black hole's gravity (which is harder than getting there), return to Earth and study the data from your probes. Did you gather enough information to win the Nobel Prize? The first player back gets to roll for the chance first. But is he or she fails, then the next finisher gets the chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has competitive and collaborative playing options, and also information for playing the game with large groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
