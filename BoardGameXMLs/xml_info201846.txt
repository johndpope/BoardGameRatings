			<description>Expancity is a city-building game in which players both collaborate and compete to build a thriving metropolis block by block!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lay down residential and commercial tiles, then claim them with your stackable building blocks to break ground on towers that will rise high above the playing field. Score extra points by building near common city buildings like banks, schools, and parks. You can also get a leg up on the opposition by working on secretly-held contract cards that offer players unique and challenging tasks to complete for bonus points. Cities expand both horizontally and vertically as the game progresses, and no two cities will ever be alike!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
