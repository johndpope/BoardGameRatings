			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deck 100 is a deck of 105 playing cards that replaces the dice in your favorite paper RPG. Not only do these cards generate results more random that any but the very best of dice, but they also introduce a number of new rules that add excitement to any game session. The first 100 cards are the &amp;quot;dice cards&amp;quot;, and also included are four Dragon Cards that may be treated like &amp;quot;jokers&amp;quot; for special effect. These are perfect for house rules you develop for this player-friendly product. The 105th card is an instruction card. For use with any game system that uses fantasy polyhedral dice, Deck100 Original (the black box) has results columns for typical polyhedral dice d100, d20, d12, d10, d8, d4 and three d6-based results for 1d6, 3d6 and 5d6. Need 2d6? Just subtract the 1d6 result from 3d6 or draw two cards and add the 1d6 results. Each card includes four columns of random results, including the Heroic gold column with results skewed a bit higher. Perfect for that final, deadliest encounter! Each card also contains a special benefit, such as a bonus to a &amp;quot;roll&amp;quot;, that may be used by a player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
