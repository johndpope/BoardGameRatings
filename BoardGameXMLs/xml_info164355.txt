							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Carnology: The Car Identification Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Carnology is a board game for car enthusiasts. A visual game of car identification, Carnology challenges players to guess the car make, model and year to score points and move around the board. This game quizzes your car knowledge from the 1900s to 2012 and challenges players to e.g. spot a '66 Corvette from 100 yards or tell the difference between a BMW, MGB or TVR just by looking at a front headlight, bumper and grill. Questions and challenges are distributed across nine categories of cars. The first player to the checkered flag is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
