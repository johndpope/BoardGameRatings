			<description>Combine soccer and shogi in one game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, both players need to control a team, 6 players token, and let them shoot the ball to another player's goal. Once you shoot the ball to the goal, you will get one point. The player who get two point win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your turn, you can choose 1 action from below 2 actions &amp;quot;twice&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;1. Move a active player (no matter it's take the ball or not)&lt;br/&gt;2. Pass (or shoot) the ball&lt;br/&gt;You can move the same player in one turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, player moving is special. Besides moving to adjacent empty space, you can, just like Chinese checkers, let player jump over another player any times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
