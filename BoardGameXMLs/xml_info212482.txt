			<description>Fun School 2 is the second set of educational games, created in 1989 by Database Educational Software. It was released on more computers than its predecessor including Acorn Electron, BBC Micro, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Amiga, DOS and RISC OS. The three individual games catered for children aged under 6 years, between 6 and 8 years and over 8 years respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fun School 2 games were programmed using the STOS (derived from BASIC) programming language[8] with the STOS Compiler Engine. The previous year, the educational market was dwindling and the release of &amp;quot;Fun School 2&amp;quot; was an outstanding success. The games sold over 60,000 copies by February and by this time a German Amiga package was developed. By April the games sold over 100,000 copies. During August in 1990, over 150,000 copies had been sold (including 30,000 Amstrad CPC copies). During the development of &amp;quot;Fun School 3&amp;quot; by December, 250,000 copies of the games had been sold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fun School 2 was reviewed as &amp;quot;The number one choice for our school&amp;quot; by Shelley Gibson. Fun School 2 was rated 3rd place in the &amp;quot;Gallup full-price software chart&amp;quot;. Commodore Force rated Fun School 2 for Under 6 Years as #43, Fun School 2 Ages 6&amp;ndash;8 as #36 and Fun School 2 Over 8 Years as number 10 in rankings of the top 100 Commodore 64 games of 1993. Despite its popularity among children, Fun School 2 was criticised by left-wing educationalists due to a competition element and the matter was brought to British MP Kenneth Baker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fun_School%23Fun_School_2 Fun School]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
