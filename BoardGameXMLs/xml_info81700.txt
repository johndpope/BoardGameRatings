			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;You are Mialie, and your entire life has been spent under the guardianship of the evil conqueror Ungaar. You yearn for your kingdom to be free again, and you long for someone to share your dreams. Now you have received a mysterious summons to a fabled cavern, where, you feel certain, your destiny will be revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He is Shaw, and although he carries his worldly belongings on his back, his gentle good looks, and his quiet strength make you feel that he is more than the wandering troubador he claims to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will your fantasy adventure lead you to your first romance, or will the decisions you make carry you into realms in which from which there is no return? In a HEARTQUEST book, you, the reader, are challenged to PICK A PATH TO ROMANCE AND ADVENTURE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
