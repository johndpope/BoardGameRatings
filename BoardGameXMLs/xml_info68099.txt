By using the assortment lists, game judges can generate any number of appropriate monsters or treasure by simply rolling dice - thus saving time in play and preparation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the front cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set contains lists of 300 monsters, 300 treasures, treasure storage/guarding/hiding modes, and complete instructions for using the assortment to fill in partially stocked or newly encountered dungeon levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This assortment of monsters and treasures by dungeon level is designed to answer two needs.
