			<description>From the Instruction book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: Tour the Napa Valley wine country starting from San Francisco, collecting wine point cards by visiting wineries along the way. In addition, Case Cards are collected from the burgundy-colored wineries at the ends of the side roads, and a bumper sticker is collected upon landing directly on Calistoga. The first person to return to San Francisco with 500 points (or a pre-determined number), at least two case cards (which are worth points and are included in the total) and a Calistoga bumper sticker, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 Decks of city cards&lt;br/&gt;1 die&lt;br/&gt;4 Wooden player tokens (in the shape of wine bottles)&lt;br/&gt;1 deck of case cards&lt;br/&gt;Bumper Stickers&lt;br/&gt;Wine Point cards&lt;br/&gt;Balloon spinner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games looks as if it were produced to advertise the wineries of the Napa Valley. Over half of the instruction booklet is filled with the names and addresses of wineries that supported the game. Not much decision making here, even the intersections on the pathways have instructions on which way the tokens must move. The components are of a nice quality and even comes with a cloth bag to hold the wine bottle pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
