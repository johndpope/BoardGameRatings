							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rolling Courts</name>
									
			<description>You are a head of a noble family who wants to be known in the courts of the kingdom. Your family members can be sent to the villages and from there buy their way into the courts by donating money. Money is gained by sending other family members to work in the mines. Will you manage to balance between the two tasks and lead your family to be the most prestigious one in the kingdoms?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to bring your family members to the courts where you'll earn victory points. You get to the courts from the village councils. The more advanced you are in the council the senior you are and the less it costs to move to the courts.&lt;br/&gt;You gain money by moving other members of our family members to the mines, the deeper you go the more money you can get. You also might be lucky to get to the deeper mines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moving your family members on the board is done by rolling 3 dice. Those 3 dice show to where you can move your family members. &lt;br/&gt;As you enter members to villages, courts &amp;amp; mines you advance the other family members that are already there, which means you are helping other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only 3 decision each turn, but you must balance between money earning and spending, free family members, position of members in the villages, and when to move to the courts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
