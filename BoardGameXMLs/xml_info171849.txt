			<description>Players build a diorama from the box by putting the 2 side panels between the box lid and bottom. Players build the starting scene by placing some 5 or 6 (of the in total 16) playing pieces into the slots inside the box. Now all players try to memorize the scene before 1 player turns away the scene and adds a playing piece to the scene. Now the scene is turned back. The rest of the &lt;br/&gt;players now try to find out which playing piece has been added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to state which playing piece has been added scores 1 point. Now the next player can add a playing piece to the scene etc. etc. until a player scored 3 points and wins the game. Players can also start with a lot of playing pieces in the slots and remove a piece in each turn. A combination of these 2 versions is obviously the hardest way to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
