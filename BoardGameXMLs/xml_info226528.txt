							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Calculator</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite her genius, as a scientist in the 1930s, Julia Hoskins was always dismissed by her male colleagues. In defiance, she created the greatest innovation of the century: an artificial man named the Promethean. He would eventually become one of the greatest heroes of World War II fighting alongside the Allies. However, the scientific leaders of the world disapproved and crushed Julia's reputation, leaving her no legitimate avenue for her work to continue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Julia continued to work in secret as The Calculator (PL 8). If mankind rejected her ideas, then Julia would have to use her advancements to dominate humanity and force them to live in a world of scientific brilliance, dominated by her obedient robots! Though she is now in prison, The Calculator's most powerful minion, Centurion (PL 7+) remains her best asset, carrying out her plans, even as she remains a model prisoner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
