			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Be careful who you trust here, friends. Not everyone is as trustworthy as me.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a realm where reality bends and half-truths walk in darkened alleys, trust is hard to come by. From those uncertain clouds comes lovable Khufusiris, with his dopey grin and easy jokes, providing advice and insight for any young traveler looking for a friendly face - or hoping to retrieve what has been stolen. But this mongrel creature is more than he appears, and far less friendly than he seems, and when backs are turned he knows best how to twist the cold knife of betrayal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product provides Game Masters with details on a shaggy sphinx found amongst the Faces of the Tarnished Souk, ready for immediate use in any campaign - but especially for use within the Coliseum Morpheuon. Each entry features ingenious stat blocks from multiple OGL sources, history, motivation, secrets, and insight into the NPC's most carefully guarded dreams, along with complete game statistics for low, middle, and high levels of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Khufusiris, a bestial betrayer and thief-taker with a hardboiled heart.&lt;br/&gt;    CR 17 advanced betrayer primordial riven magic criosphinx&lt;br/&gt;    CR 13 advanced primordial riven magic criosphinx&lt;br/&gt;    CR 9 advanced primordial criosphinx&lt;br/&gt;    Betrayer, Primordial, and Riven Magic creature templates, for an ancient anti-magical antagonist with advanced avarice&lt;br/&gt;    A new magical tattoo for hungry hunters&lt;br/&gt;    Feats for draining defenses, playing possum, and ignoring armor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
