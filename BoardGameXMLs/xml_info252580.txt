			<description>This is the 30th anniversary remake of the homonymous game, originally released in 1988. The gameplay is basically the same, but the rules have been revised and simplified for a more streamlined experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players assume the roles of adventurers with the ability to summon monsters. They delve into the dungeons, aiming to lay their hands on treasures and return safely, while hindering the progression of other players by summoning monsters into their ways.&lt;br/&gt;Of course, there is more hidden in the corners of the underground labyrinths! The heroes might encounter helpful characters, find powerful weapons and items, but they might stumble into traps and other nasty obstacles as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional information: Monster Maker is a quite popular franchise in Japan, which became a considerably extensive fantasy universe over the years. It expanded into RPG, boardgames, collectible card games, videogames, novels, comics and manga as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
