			<description>From &amp;quot;Overview of the Game:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zodia Sunset is a game designed to facilitate anime mecha role playing adventures. In essence, this includes two components: The mecha themselves and the men and women that pilot them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mecha are giant robot fighting machines usually around 30 to 50 feet in height. They are plated with armor and equipped with devastating weapons. Conventional weapons of war (infantry, tanks, pair and space ships) are generally all but useless against them. The only thing that can stand against a mecha is another mecha!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ironically, while the focus of this game might be perceived as mecha combat, and half of your play time will involve the combats of these giant robots, the real story and role playing revolves around the people inside the machine. While inside their fighting machine, the mecha pilot is mainly concerned with battle. However, this is but a small portion of their life (and the story). When outside their mecha their life is full of other drama. Personal problems, love interests (or disinterests), dark secrets, self doubt, and all sorts of conflicts with friend, foe, and even oneself are what make the story interesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
