			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magical Fury is a dark magical girl RPG, inspired by anime series like Madoka Magica, Sailor Moon, and Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha. Your characters start out as normal girls who discover that they are reincarnated magical girls. They awaken to their powers under fire, and it will be up to you to decide where she goes with new her life from there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a very simple variant of the Apocalypse World engine, aimed at fast and flavorful play that you can jump into on short notice or play in a more deliberate, long-term style. Battles come down to a handful of rolls, and throughout the emphasis is decidedly on the consequences of the course of action you choose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book also includes an appendix with 17 random tables to help you along with character creation and other things that pop up during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play you will need some six-sided dice, character sheets, and something to write with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
