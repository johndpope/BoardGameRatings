			<description>Turnspell is a Scrabble-like word building game.  The main difference is that instead of having a hand of letter tiles and a common board, players have personal boards and they draft letters from a common pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, each player selects one letter tile from the four available to them on the central board.  Players then place that letter on their personal game board.  Empty spaces on the central board are filled randomly from the bag, then the board is rotated clockwise and players select a new letter tile from those available to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are attempting to build four letter words only.  Once a four letter word is completed, that word is immediately scored and the letter tiles are returned to the bag.  The first player to 44 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
