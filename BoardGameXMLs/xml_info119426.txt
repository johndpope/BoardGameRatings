							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ed, Edd n Eddy: Scam of the Century</name>
									
			<description>Ed, Edd n Eddy: Scam of the Century is an action game developed and published by D3 Publisher America for the Nintendo DS handheld console. The game is based on the popular, long-running Cartoon Network series, Ed, Edd n Eddy. The game was released on October 23, 2007 in the United States. In the game, the Eds run the risk of having their scams turned on them by the other kids in the neighborhood. Many of the objects and characters, as well as the visual style, borrow heavily from the cartoon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Ed has his own set of levels to complete. They're all side-scrolling fare, but each Ed has his own style of movement and attacks. Edd throws dictionaries, Ed slams his head down on the enemies, while Eddy spits his gum at enemies (Although this freezes the enemy, it does not defeat them). Item pick-ups can be activated on the touch-screen.&lt;br/&gt;On top of the platforming elements, the game contains a number of unlockable mini-games: Whack-a-Mole has been turned into &amp;quot;Whack a Zit&amp;quot; where players tap at rising pimples on Ed's back before they burst. There's also a pie-throwing challenge where players flick the desserts up at enemies on the top screen.[2] The game features 13 total stages, special attacks using the touch screen, the option to blow into the microphone to bring characters back to life, three side story mini-games and special items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy: Scam of the Century&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
