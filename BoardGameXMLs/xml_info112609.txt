			<description>With this game, children learn about geography, particularly topography. On the game board an illustrated map of the world is depicted. The continents are each in a different color, so they can be distinguished easily. The countries are easy to find by numbers and colors. At the edge of the board flags are shown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 110 illustrated cards with questions (and answers) such as: Where do polar bears live? Where is the Eiffel Tower located? Background information, continents, countries and people pass by. Players have to respond the correct country, continent or ocean and have to designate them on the world map. By doing this correctly chips can be earned. The first player who has collected 8 chips wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules also describe a second way of playing. Here 24 random cards are put face up in the middle of the game board. The players take turns throwing a die and moving their pawn in accordance on the flags around the game board. They have to collect cards by selecting cards from the middle which are related to the country their pawn landed on. If no such a card is available, the player just has bad luck. Once a player reaches the last field, the player with the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
