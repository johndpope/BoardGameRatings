			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Test your knowledge of the '90s onwards. For hardcore music buffs, there are essential facts related to music, concerts and videos. For the more lifestyle conscious, there's must-have info on the celebrities that make the music - their sense of fun, their love-lives, famous interview quotes and lots more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever your interest, it's all here in this handy wedge that you can take anywhere. Or, if you prefer, you can use these 600 questions with your Trivial Pursuit boardgame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is another in the &amp;quot;Bite-Size&amp;quot; range of Trivial Pursuit games. It is intended as a portable travel game. The game is packaged in a wedge (&amp;quot;piece-of-pie&amp;quot;) shaped box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game does not feature a game board, and thus, there is no roll-and-move mechanic. Instead, players roll the color-coded die, and answers a question matching the color rolled. If a player correctly answers a question, he may &amp;quot;go for a wedge&amp;quot; by answering another question in the same category. If he does so, he keeps that card. If the player answers a question incorrectly, it is the next player's turn. Play ends when a player has collected six cards/correctly answered 12 questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
