							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Spirit Warrior Redux</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;nfused with the supernatural energies and powers of exemplar spirits, Spirit Warriors auras explode with energy and protect them from their foes. Gaining the martial prowess of primal energies these warriors can easily face almost any challenge in battle, yet not without cost. Once their spirit energy is released, the Spirit Warrior is at her weakest and most vulnerable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spirit Warrior class is an update of the same class presented by Necromancers of the Northwest, but it has been updated and expanded to give it more of a contemporary feel. In addition, the martial system found in Dreamscarred Press' Path of War has been included in this update and guidelines are given for players and game masters to create more exemplar spirits as desired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
