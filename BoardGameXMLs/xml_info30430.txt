			<description>Ridiculous Vanity is a miniatures rules set that simulates European politics and land warfare during the age of Louis XIV.  It is really two games in one.  The first is a campaign game where the players are national leaders engaging in politics and moving forces across a map of Europe divided into areas with differing economic and strategic value.  The second is a set of miniatures rules for simulating battle from 1660 to 1715.  The rules may be used exclusively of the campaign system and vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules do not require re-basing from other rules systems.  The units are standardized with infantry battalions consisting of 12 castings, two cavalry squadrons are 4 castings each.  The number of castings per stand varies with foot and cavalry types.  Armies are organized into commands and orders are issued to commands and groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book includes several campaign scenarios set for different periods beginning in 1660, 1680, 1690 and 1701.  There is also one battle scenario for the Battle of Utrecht, 1676.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
