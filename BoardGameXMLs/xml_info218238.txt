			<description>A Kickstarter &amp;quot;non-role-playing-game&amp;quot; RPG simulation stretch goal for the anti-gaming mockumentary Attacking the Darkness by Dead Gentlemen Productions and Zombie Orpheus Entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Hi there! My name is Harmony Hope Bryant and a few years ago my husband Brady Bryant and I, along with a talented group of hardworking people and some others, made the landmark movie Attacking the Darkness to warn America and beyond about the very real dangers of role-playing games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brady and I were approached by the Dead Gentlemen, a group of young, idealistic youths with a vision and a mission... to spread the word of the Lord and to warn people of the dangers of RPG's (role-playing-games) through the lens of my ground-breaking film Attacking the Darkness, through their NRPG  (non-role-playing-game) Attack the Darkness. It was a simple plan. It just might work!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is truly a blessing to welcome you to Attack the Darkness, a valuable spiritual education tool and a fun adventure that, the creators have assured me, is absolutely, positively not a role-playing-game! As you and your fellow spiritual warriors make your way through the simulated scenarios, you will see first hand the powerful traps set by RPG's to ensure those who aren't strong enough to fend off the very real forces of the devil through demonic possession. You have been provided with the information and tools that you need, but it will be your faith and tenacity that will see you through to the light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am so excited about the people and places this game can reach, and to witness the power of wholesome entertainment and fun. Brady and I hope you will use these experiences to go forth and help us save the world from the darkness.  Brady, I and Jesus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An epic scenario that is NOT an RPG, compatible with Demon Hunters: A Comedy of Terrors system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
