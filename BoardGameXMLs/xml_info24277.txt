			<description>Roll the dice and move around the board. Land in certain areas to buy and/or sell investments. Other areas also allow trading and selling of investments to other players. Also, you can purchase investment chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this is an investment strategy game, the person with the most money is not the winner. The first person to have ten chips is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
