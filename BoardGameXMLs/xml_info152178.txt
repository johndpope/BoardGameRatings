			<description>author summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visitors &amp;amp; Visions is a game about testing the limits of the creative mind. The entirety of the game takes place within a secretive institution known as Heart-home, where trained professionals enter the minds of comatose creative geniuses called Anchors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the last several years, Heart-home has used its technology to extract the blueprints for brilliant innovations from the minds of Anchors. Unfortunately, a mysterious mental infection known as the Fuss has begun to twist and corrupt the visions of every Anchor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a player, you take on the role of a visitor, one of the few professionals trained to mind-link with Anchors. During the game, you will traverse a variety of imaginary environments and settings. Your goal: discover the origin of the Fuss and eliminate it, before it consumes the world's finest creative minds -- and perhaps the mental fabric of humanity itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
