			<description>(Title in English: Recognize Europe)&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets one of the 12 assignments in the shape of a card with a picture of a landmark and information of a European country. There are also 48 memory cards. A player's goal is to gather the four pieces of the picture; memory style. However, a player can only turn cards around, while going round the playing board and landing on a turn '1, 2, 3, or 4 cards' position. Look out though for the black pawn which can send you back to start before you can reach the 'turn 4 cards' game spaces! &lt;br/&gt;A player who completes all the assignments first is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;(Number of assignments needed to win: 6 when there are 2 players, 4 with 3 players and 3 with 4 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Game created by order of the Rabobank)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
