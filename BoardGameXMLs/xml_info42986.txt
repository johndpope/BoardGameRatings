			<description>This game is a horse racing game utilizing a scoring board and a 12&amp;quot; 78rpm record. Players place their bets for the horse(s) of their choice. on the scoring board. The available horses include some of the greats of all time with Omaha, Whirlaway, Count Fleet, Bold Venture, War Admiral and Pensive. After wagers are placed the record is played. The record features interleaved tracks so that the record player's needle can go into any one of a number of grooves with each groove being a different race result. The record plays something comparable to a radio broadcast of the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
