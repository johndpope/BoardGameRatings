							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wine Knot</name>
									
			<description>A very old nautical drinking game, playable in 8 x variations. The games in 'Wine Knot' are variations of old nautical drinking games, believed to have been originated by Portuguese sailors involved in the notorious 'triangular trade' of the 18th century where wine and textiles were shipped to Africa, traded for slaves who were then shipped to the Americas, the ships returning to Europe with cargoes of molasses and tobacco. Long periods at sea and wine in abundance, diversions were created using the materials at hand; wood, canvas and rope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are eight games to be played, which will provide interesting, unusual and amusing entertainment for up 8 players for as many hours as you wish.&lt;br/&gt;Port wine was originally used but because of its strength an ordinary (or extraordinary) bottle of red or white wine will ensure that the game does not finish too early.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
