			<description>Relics of Olympus is mini expansion for the Omen: A Reign of War game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 6 different Relics:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     FORGE OF HEPHAESTUS - When a Soldier enter this city on your side, it gains 1 additional strength until the end of your turn.&lt;br/&gt;     HELM OF HERMES - When you play a Soldier into this city from your hand, you may draw 1 card. If you do, choose and discard 1 card from your hand.&lt;br/&gt;     APHRODITE'S ROSE - During your Portent step, when you reveal the top card of the deck for an Oracle's ability in this city, if an Oracle is not revealed, you may reveal 1 additional card.&lt;br/&gt;     DEMETER'S SCYTHE - When you play a Unit into this city from your hand, you may discard 1 card from you hand. If you do, reduce that Unit's cost by 1.&lt;br/&gt;     APOLLO'S CREED - If an ability of an opposing player's Unit would cause a Soldier in this city to be discarded, you may instead discard a Soldier from your hand of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;     DIONYSUS' FLASK - When a Soldier enters this city, of either side, ignore its ability. During either player's Portent step, Oracle abilities in this city are not used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relics begin play to the side of the play area.  Once per Feat Step, if the player would achieve a Feat, instead of flipping that Feat face down, he may instead gain a Relic.  He selects a Relic from the side of the play area and places it face up on his side of any City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There may only be 1 Relic per City.  If a player chooses to place a Relic he has just gained in a City that already has a Relic in it, the original Relic is moved to the side of the play area, even if the Relic was on the opposing player's side of the City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Relic is worth 1 point to the player at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
