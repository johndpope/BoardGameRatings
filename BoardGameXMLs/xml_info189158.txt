Then the nuclear summer made the temperature shoot up and the nuclear snow turned to irradiated acid rain. The polar ice caps melted and the coasts were submerged completely. The last few survivors await the end in the few remaining shelters in the deserts, as the changing weather moves the rain even into previous arid areas of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
