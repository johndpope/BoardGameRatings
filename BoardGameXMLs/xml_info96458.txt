			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've built the perfect simulated life on earth.  Now let's see how you do with the rest of the galaxy.  Welcome to Space Colony, where your life depends on an unruly group of fellow space rejects.  Between managing the resources of the colony and managing the various neuroses of your fellow colonists, you may feel the vastness of space closing in on you.  Ahh, life beyond the stars.  It's everything the brochure said it would be!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Save the Colony!  Your staff are brawling, the Harvester Robot is chain sawing its way through the oxygen supply and small furry aliens have taken over the disco.  This is home!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each unique personality has a mind of its own so remember happy colonists make for productive colonists.  Ignore them and they'll pick fights, argue, get depressed, and eventually go crazy.  Nurture them and they will work hard for you, become friends, and maybe even fall in love!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With over 100 buildings at your disposal, it's up to you to build a colony that meets all the colonists' needs and keeps them safe and happy.  So before you shell out all your credits on iron extraction and space chicken production to bring in the cash, remember, that without a gym, a sauna or a half decent restaurant, nobody's going to want to work for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sim with real personality!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
