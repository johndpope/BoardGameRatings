			<description>How Do I Use a Tournament Kit?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tournament Kits are designed for use with our competitive games, such as Warhammer: Diskwars, and they can be used in several ways. These kits include prize support and promotional material designed to support competitive or casual tournament play at local retailers. Run an eight-week tournament series or league, use the prizes to support a single, large tournament, or host a weekly casual game night. Tournament Kits also come with a guide that provides tips and ideas on how to run a great event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exclusive Scenarios!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Spring 2015 Warhammer: Diskwars Tournament Kit comes with eight copies of the exclusive Bloodgreed scenario. Scenarios are a great way to shake up your local players&amp;rsquo; habits or introduce a new experience to your community. Use the scenarios during your event, making players use them for one round or the entire tournament, or introduce them in your own creative way. No matter how you use the scenarios, make sure to give them away as prizes before the end of the season!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in the Spring 2015 Warhammer: Diskwars Tournament Kit?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Spring 2015 Warhammer: Diskwars Tournament Kit comes with exciting prizes and materials to help tournament organizers:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eight copies of the Bloodgreed scenario&lt;br/&gt;Two copies of an alternate art Karl Franz disc&lt;br/&gt;Seventeen copies of an alternate art Skeleton Warriors disc&lt;br/&gt;Four Empire card boxes depicting Karl Franz&lt;br/&gt;A promotional poster featuring Karl Franz&lt;br/&gt;One informational pamphlet on running a tournament or league&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
