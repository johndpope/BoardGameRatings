			<description>Game featured in the 1952 Dingbats' Annual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board features 4 separate tracks to the Home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets 4 counters in their chosen colour and start from the same coloured corner. Throw a dice which shows the four colours. Move a piece on to the next same coloured square on your track. Instead of moving a piece already on the board, you may enter another of your counters on to the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you roll your own colour you may advance one piece towards home and take another turn. Game proceeds in this manner until one player gets all four counters home. He or she is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
