			<description>Hupsis is a dexterity game, where a card board waiter tries to keep his balance and not to drop any plates from his tray.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game you have to assemble the card board waiter, which is swinging on a stand. You also have a common stock of card board plates, with different foods printed on them. At the start of the game every player gets few banknotes and when you run out of money, you drop out of the game. Last player with money wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you add a plate in to waiters tray. If the waiter swings and plates drop, then you must pay him a tip. If plates don't drop, then you succeeded. In both cases it's the next players turn to add plate. This goes on until only one player has money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
