			<description>From the publisher's website: &lt;br/&gt;Young Marie Tonsen yawned as she stepped into the kitchen for a midnight drink of water.What she saw was little Weatherby, the family haffun butler, covered in blood, standing over a dead body who looked like he might be some kind of burglar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mister Weatherby?&amp;rdquo; the girl asked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weatherby smiled. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a nightmare, child. Go back to sleep.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wicked Fantasy began as a series of articles in Kobold Quarterly Magazine reinventing the &amp;ldquo;standard races&amp;rdquo; in fantasy roleplaying. Now, those same articles have been expanded and revised (five times their original size!) and fit with the PATHFINDER Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Viewed by humans as harmless servants, the &amp;ldquo;haffun&amp;rdquo; race integrated itself into their society seemlessly. They are gardners and butchers and maids and butlers. But the haffuns hold a secret that hardly any human even suspects, and it isn&amp;rsquo;t just that they guard humans while they sleep. There is a deeper horror in the world. And haffuns know its name&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third race in the Wicked Fantasy series&amp;ndash;Seeming Servants&amp;ndash;tackles the&amp;hellip; well&amp;hellip; John&amp;rsquo;s least favorite race in all of fantasy literature: the halfling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While they appear to be peaceful gardners (with a slight addiction to &amp;ldquo;pipe weed&amp;rdquo;), haffuns are a race with a thouand secrets&amp;hellip; and a sacred oath to keep them at any cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wicked Fantasy: Seeming Servants includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    FULL COLOR AND FULLY ILLUSTRATED!&lt;br/&gt;    New Haffun Racial Traits&lt;br/&gt;    New Feats including Family Feats and Talda (stealth) Feats&lt;br/&gt;    New Oracle Archetype: The Ghostspeaker&lt;br/&gt;    New Haffun Only Core Class: &amp;ldquo;The Bulter&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;    A New &amp;ldquo;Haffun Family&amp;rdquo; System that allows players to build their own Haffun Families&lt;br/&gt;    The Great Secret the Haffuns are keeping from Humanity!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
