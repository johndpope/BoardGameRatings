			<description>Bluff and Bet your way to victory. Wedge uses the deceptively simple mechanics of bluffing and set creation to regulate this clever game of wedging your card into just the right spot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses just a deck of cards, a handful of player markers and betting chips to create a linear line from 1-20. Players use cards valued from 1 through 20, dealt at random, to create the line. Placing adjacent to blocks can score you big points but that windfall can also be seen by opponents. Do you go for the obvious points or try to bluff and take your opponent's wagers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game of Wedge takes only 20 or so minutes and it is a great ice-breaker to get things kicked off or a nice closer to wind things up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
