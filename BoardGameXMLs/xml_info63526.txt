							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">About Time: Das ZEIT Spiel</name>
									
			<description>The German version of About Time has been published with Die Zeit newspaper. It has all the features of the original game with all German questions, written especially for the German speaking market, and all German rules. There are a few changes from the original. There are five up arrows to the Centre from the Inner Circle making for a quicker game. Also the Highwayman has been lost in this version, although Duels and Plagues are still here. There are no multi-year question cards now - all have six answers from a single year going back to Ancient times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
