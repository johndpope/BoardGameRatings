			<description>Salerno '43 covers the Western Allies' return to Europe as they invade Italy in the autumn of 1943. They are met at the Salerno beachhead by desperate German counterattacks.  Had the Allies been defeated here, Hitler's southern flank would have been secure. But the Allies clawed their way ashore, fighting inland against some of the toughest outfits in the Wehrmacht.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also featured are the campaigns of the Anzio landings in 1944, as well as the German airdrop on Crete in 1941.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variety of Play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By default, units are of battalion size. However, players may break them down into companies for more realistic play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Salerno '43 includes three Master Maps:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Crete - Island and Sea (310x100 hexes).&lt;br/&gt;- Anzio - Coastal Area (50x56 hexes)&lt;br/&gt;- Salerno - Coastal Area (96x55 hexes)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-26 scenarios, which are on average smaller than the normal Panzer Campaigns and Campaign Games -- which can be fairly large&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-1 Introductory scenario&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-7 Crete scenarios  Campaign Game is 90 Turns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Crete includes some &amp;quot;What Ifs&amp;quot; with variable drop zones&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-9 Salerno scenarios  -Campaign Game is 80 Turns -Map is 95 x 55 hexes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Includes main game, an order of battle editor and a scenario editor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
