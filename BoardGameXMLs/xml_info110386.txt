			<description>Nobles  from  across  the  land  have  been  called  to  compete  in  grand tournaments  as  the  King  is  looking  for  a  new champion of the realm.  This champion  will  be  determined  by  the  Noble  who  gains  the  most  glory  in  these grand tournaments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knights from across the realm gather to serve these nobles and gain the rewards of riches and glory in their service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you take on the role of one of these Nobles and use the knights that decide to serve you in order to gain the glory needed to be champion of the realm?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The challenge is to collect Knights from the 6 different Event Types included in the game to create a team that will compete against the other Nobles team of knights for glory in the different tournament seasons. Knights cost money and the Nobles only collect a certain amount each tournament season to pay for their knights. The Tournaments are played by Nobles secretly deciding in which order their knights will compete and then by simply turning their cards face down in their hand to create a small deck they begin drawing their cards one at a time off the top of these decks to play against another Noble's knights in individual competition. Points are scored for the Noble with the highest value knight played (six cards will be played against one another in this way) - and 1 glory is gained by the Noble with the most points at the end of that competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Tournament is made up of each Noble in the game plying each other once in a competition like the one described above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the tournament season is over players have to return some knights to their season decks / hire other knights / collect gold / and try to gain more glory in the next Tournament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game ends when one Noble gains enough glory to win the Kings favor, and become champion of the realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
