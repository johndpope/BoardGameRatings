			<description>This first version of Grandmama's Game of Riddles was one of a series of six Grandmama games issued by McLoughlin Bros. in the 1860s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes in a small wooden box and includes 120 numbered small cards, each with a riddle question. Any number may play, with one player taking on the role of &amp;quot;Preceptor&amp;quot; (holding the rule book) and the others as &amp;quot;Scholars&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules call for at least six cards to be dealt face down to each Scholar. Each Scholar in turn picks up one of his cards. If he answers correctly, he holds it. Otherwise, the opportunity to answer moves round the table clockwise, with the first Scholar to answer the riddle correctly keeping the card. Scholar with the most cards at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
