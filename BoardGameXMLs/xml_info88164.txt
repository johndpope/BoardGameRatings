							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Great Aspeigh: A Detailed Hamlet</name>
									
			<description>From &amp;quot;How Great Aspeigh Can Fit in Your Campaign&amp;quot;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great Aspeigh easily fits into the Terra Ferax campaign, because it is a part of that campaign. If you want general guides to fit the hamlet elsewhere, this section is for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because the hamlet is small, and many campaign maps ignore the smaller places, it can fit just about anywhere. Great Aspeigh is in plains and near a river. You may note that there is not a local temple only a local druid and he is almost worthless to higher level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For low level characters, Great Aspeigh is a fine place to obtain goods and services. There are plenty of ruins and dangerous places to explore. If your adventurers need a base of operations, they can settle into an abandoned building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A high level cleric could turn Great Aspeigh back into a thriving area again. It's a great place for old characters to retire to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
