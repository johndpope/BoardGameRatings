			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How would the world be different if each of us had the opportunity to truly see what we are capable of? A Touch of Fate explores a world in which everyone is given the opportunity to glimpse a fragment, the briefest flash, of their potential. It is a game that emphasizes storytelling, rich description, and teamwork. It is designed to be played in a couple of hours with little preparation. The game requires four heroes and one player guiding the story called the Story Teller. The setting, like the themes, are universal, and the game can easily be played in the distance past, the far future, or any world in between.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
