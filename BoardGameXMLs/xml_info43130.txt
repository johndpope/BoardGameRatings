							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Beer Game</name>
									
			<description>A simulation game which is made specificly to demonstrate some key principles of supply chain management. It is created in the early 1960's by some professors of the MIT Sloan School of Management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by 4 to 8 people, which have to work co-operative on a board. The target is to meet the customer demand of beer at the end of the chain, which exists out of four parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game exists out of a specific amount of days (rounds) (which is pre-defined by the presentator). At the end of each day you have to count what you have in stock or by how much you couldn't meet the demand. For this you'll have to pay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When there are more boards, the team with the lowest cost at the end wins, while they have done the best on meeting the demand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
