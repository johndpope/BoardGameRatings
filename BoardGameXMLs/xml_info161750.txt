			<description>As producers of their own movies in the aptly named Producer, players scramble to hire actors; line up plot elements such as characters, problems, and resolutions; and toss in a few bonus items such as costumes in order to make the best movie they can. They can trade with other players or sabotage those competing productions. The final round starts when the first player wraps, and victory is a combination of cards played and how well each player tells the story of her movie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
