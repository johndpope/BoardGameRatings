							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Apple Bandai Pippin</name>
									
			<description>The Pippin is a multimedia platform designed by Apple Inc. (then Apple Computer Inc.) and produced by Bandai in 1995. It was based on a 66 MHz PowerPC 603 processor, a 14.4 kbit/s modem and ran a stripped version of the System 7.5.2 operating system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal was to create an inexpensive computer aimed mostly at playing CD-based multimedia titles, especially games, but also functioning as a network computer. It featured a 4x CD-ROM drive and a video output that could connect to a standard television display.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The platform was named for the Newtown Pippin, an apple cultivar, a smaller and more tart relative of the McIntosh apple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Bandai_Pippin&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Bandai_Pippin&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
