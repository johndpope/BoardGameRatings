							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Return of the Prodigal Son</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure takes place in Thyatis City in the Summer of 1005 but any other large city with a well developed underclass would do. The PC&amp;rsquo;s need to be between level 8 and 10 and have at least one cleric and one thief in the party. A party of about 6 characters should be sufficient for this dangerous adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure concerns the disappearance of a number of beggars and other lowlife from the city in an area known as Axetown. The Thieves Guild believe it to be the work of a corrupt politician who wants the area levelled so that he can build his new estate there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Typically distributed as an archive containing the DOC scenario file and three GIF map files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
