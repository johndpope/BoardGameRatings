			<description>From the developers website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rediscover the joy of board games on the iPad with Fluke HD.

Fluke HD represents a digital twist on the board game genre with gameplay in the vein of classics such as Snakes &amp;amp; Ladders, Sorry! and Ludo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fluke HD is a virtual board game that requires opponents to employ both strategic play and a healthy dose of luck. Players are each given four colored tokens which they must navigate across any one of the game&amp;rsquo;s many uniquely themed boards in order to win. &lt;br/&gt;A victory can only be achieved if a player is able to get all four of their game pieces across the finish line. Though seemingly straight forward, a variety of different interactive obstacles and surprises await players on each of the game&amp;rsquo;s four board options and no two boards are alike. Users can either play against live opponents or online via Apple&amp;rsquo;s Game Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides providing customers with engaging and exiting gameplay, another main focus of Fluke HD is to offer users an iPad based board game that utilizes this mobile media to its full potential.
