			<description>Wild Wild Racing is an off-road racing game created exclusively for the PlayStation 2 by Rage Software Limited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was one of the first games released on the PlayStation 2 and was released on the same day as the console in the US and Europe on October 26, 2000 and November 24, 2000 respectively. Wild Wild Racing allows players to compete in all-terrain vehicle races in various countries around the globe. There are five locations in the game: United States, India, Iceland, Mexico and Australia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the off-road racing circuits, Wild Wild Racing includes a series of fun mini-games that allow the player to upgrade and access new vehicles. These challenges are one of three different types; Quest (find the letters that spell out the name of the next unlockable car around the track), Skill (use your car to push a large ball through a crazy golf style course to the finish line, harder than it sounds), and Stunt (complete an extreme stunt course including jumps over a series of objects etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wild Wild Racing was released in all three major territories; Japan, the USA and Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Wild Wild Racing&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
