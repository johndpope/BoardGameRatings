			<description>&lt;br/&gt;     A True or False Coronation Street trivia board game&lt;br/&gt;     Includes over 760 True or False Coronation Street question&lt;br/&gt;     Question cards span over four decades of the popular television soap opera&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game description from the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take a trip around the cobbles with this fun True or False Trivia Board Game and test your knowledge of all things Coronation Street and includes over 750 True or False questions spanning four decades. Use voting chips and cobbling chips to earn extra points to help you around the board and be the first to reach The famous Rovers Return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start the game by deciding if you will play as individuals or in teams and then choose a character mover and place them on the Start space. Each player or team is then given a True or False voting chip and three cobble chips.&lt;br/&gt;Taking it in turn to be the Question Reader, they must pick up a card from the deck in the centre of the board and read out the question. Opponents then need to decide whether the trivia question is true or false and lay their voting chip up the correct way to answer the question. Once all voting chips have been paid down, cobbling can begin.&lt;br/&gt;Cobbling gives players the chance to pick up bonus points to help them move further around the board based on an opponent's true or false answer to the question. If the opponent's answer that you 'bet' your cobble chip on is correct then you get to keep your cobble chip and gain an extra point. But if their answer to the question was wrong and you chose to cobble, then you lose that chip.&lt;br/&gt;Once players complete a full lap of the board and move past the Start space on the board, they can collect a 30 points token. If you pass Start twice, then flip the token over to reveal 60 points.&lt;br/&gt;After the last True or False card is played and all players have moved their character mover the amount of spaces they've earned, the player with the highest score (most 30/60 token points plus the score on the board) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
