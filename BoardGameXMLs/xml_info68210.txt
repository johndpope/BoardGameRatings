			<description>publisher description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This tabletop adventure game is based upon the cult 1960's TV series 'The Prisoner'. The series featured 'Number 6' a former secret agent of the British Government during the Cold War, who is never identified by name. After resigning his position he is abducted and held prisoner in a small, isolated eccentric sea-side resort known only as 'The Village'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Card- Board Games' is a new and exciting concept in tabletop adventure games play. From a simple pack of cards you are able to build up a unique playing area from the centre of your dining table. Since the cards are laid strategically then each game you play will be different and pose new challenges for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A playing piece and a few counters are all you need to start the game. Its your job to move your playing piece along the paths to the outer limits of the board without other players getting in your way. As the game develops you collect additional cards which will either help you on your way or impede the progress of the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
