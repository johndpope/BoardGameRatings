			<description>From the Late for the Sky website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S. Postal Service is proud of its role in portraying the American experience to a world audience through postage stamps. U.S. postage stamps magically transport us from sea to sea, from North to South, and everywhere in between!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;POST OFFICE-OPOLY, The Wonders of America Stamp Edition, celebrates the spectacular &amp;quot;Wonders of America: Land of Superlatives&amp;quot; Collection...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EXPLORE THE WONDERS COAST TO COAST!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buy your favorite stamps, build monopolies, and increase your rent by adding Post Offices and Bulk Mail Centers... Sounds easy enough, but throw in some &amp;quot;over the weight limit&amp;quot; packages, over-stuffed mailboxes and a temperamental dog and it gets a little more difficult and A LOT more fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who knows?!? You may soon find yourself missing the seat of your pants...or you may be elected Postmaster General!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s YOUR roll!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What A Wonderful Thing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
