							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Encounters: Sci-Fi Scenarios</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Encounters: Sci-Fi Scenarios&amp;quot; provides referees with guidelines for planning adventures and running exciting encounters for their favorite sci-fi role-playing games. Sections offer valuable advice for developing a consistent campaign setting, where NPCs have realistic motives and character actions make a difference. Straightforward tables allow you to quickly generate interstellar travel encounters and mishaps, location-specific encounters, mission complications, and encounters that stem from from the players' actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entries provide the level of detail you want, ranging from &amp;quot;just the facts&amp;quot; to specific events with twists that encourage character development and reward role playing. One section generates events specifically for characters that get separated (or wander off) from the group. Also included are new starship designs and additional background material for the Era Ten campaign setting. This book is written for use with Era Ten, but is easily adaptable to any science fiction role-playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Encounters: Sci-Fi Scenarios&amp;quot; uses a pair of 8-sided dice and a standard deck of playing cards (not included).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
