			<description>A simple roll and move race game played on a map of Australia overlaid with a 12x12 grid f squares numbered from 1 (Brisbane) to 136 (Sydney), with 8 unnumbered squares.&lt;br/&gt;The object appears to be to move from Brisbane to Sydney via the numbered squares. 9 of the squares appear to be hazards: 5 at sea (2 wrecks, 2 contrary winds), and 4 on land (3 desert and 1 bush).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An advertisement for the game was published in the &amp;quot;West Australian&amp;quot; newspaper (Perth) on Wed 6. Oct. 1909, p.6 col. 7:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This, it seems, is an adaptation to the Commonwealth of a map game, said to have been exceedingly popular in the different countries to which it has seen made applicable. The Australian map is marked of into 136 squares, and with the aid of dice which determine each stage and counters for each of two, three, or four players, a journey is performed throughout Australia, beginning at Brisbane and terminable only at Sydney. In the shape of contrary winds, a wreck, deserts, bush, and other obstacles to easy journeyings, the way of the traveller is made difficult, and at the same time exciting, and by an ingenious contrivance in the rules the question whether he will ever reach Sydney is attended with considerable doubt, which enhances the interest of the game. Both for young and old it should prove thoroughly diverting, and it has the added advantage of possessing considerable educational value. Wigg and Son are selling it at a price intended to bring it within the reach of everyone&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
