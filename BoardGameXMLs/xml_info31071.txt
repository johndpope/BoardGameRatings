			<description>French cycling game that was also released in a German edition. The game is presented in a big (42x33cm) plastic suitcase that contains all components. It features 12 cyclist riders (they are 6 cm high, which is rather big) in 6 different colours, thus 2 riders per team. As in most racing games, the goal is to reach the finish first with your riders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
