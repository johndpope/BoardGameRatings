			<description>Tactical board game where you have to shop as quickly as possible while managing its budget. Each player receives 12 euros and its shopping list. &lt;br/&gt;In her turn player roll the dice and moves her pawn in the direction of her choice. Every time she lands on a colored box she can make a purchase in the store of the same color. She then roll the dice to determine Euros she may use. The amount sets her budget and she decides whether to buy. The winner is the first that comes out of the market with all purchases in her shopping list!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
