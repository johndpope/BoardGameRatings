			<description>Ghost 1.0 is a Metroidvania video game developed and published by Francisco &amp;quot;franfistro&amp;quot; T&amp;eacute;llez de Meneses, the developer of Unepic, in collaboration with an unnamed development team&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player starts as a gynoid known as the Chassis, which is being remote-controlled by a female, humanoid life-form known as Ghost. Ghost has the ability to use the Chassis as her physical body, and engage in combat by shooting enemies and using other weapons and techniques. She can also abandon the Chassis, leaving it defenseless and traveling the world as a virtual &amp;quot;ghost&amp;quot; to hack into other robots and take them over.[2] This can be used to find secrets or to destroy other robots that would otherwise be dangerous.[2] If the Chassis is destroyed, it is automatically replicated by super-fast 3D printer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In typical Metroidvania fashion, the player is expected to explore the game world and collect various access cards and other items that will unlock the next area of the game. At certain points at the end of a level, the player must fight bosses to proceed. Certain rooms contain alarms that must be triggered, causing a gauntlet of enemies that can be fought repeatedly for more money (in the form of energy).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can unlock skills through the use of a skill tree.[2] The player gains skill points based on how many access codes they have obtained, rather than by leveling up in the traditional sense by defeating enemies. However, the player can upgrade weapons in a more traditional manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also contains mandatory puzzle sections in the form of a laser-dodging minigame, where the player must possess one or more robots to make it past a laser grid that will destroy the robots on contact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_1.0 Ghost 1.0]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
