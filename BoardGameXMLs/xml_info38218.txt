			<description>This is themed after Dishonest John and the characters from the Beany &amp;amp; Cecil cartoon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a surprise action game for 2 to 6 players. Dishonest John is a spring loaded timer that is pressed down after all the 44 cards with the extra Dishonest john card is dealt out to all the players. Players then take turns passing one card to the opponent on their left until Dishonest John springs up which ends the round. You then score your hand based on how many cards you have of the different suits (pairs, three of a kind, four of a kind, and etc.). The person stuck holding the Dishonest John card gets minus 30 points for it. You keep playing another round until someone scores 250 points and is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
