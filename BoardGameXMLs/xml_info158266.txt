			<description>The players begin with sets of identical blocks and place their respective blocks upright on opposite sides of a battlefield that consists either of hexes or of squares. Players take turns downing an opponent's piece (placing a piece in an unobstructed line of sight to the opponent's piece), taking out an opponent's piece (moving onto a space occupied by an opponent's downed piece and then removing that piece from the board), or restoring a downed piece (placing that piece upright in one's home area). A player wins when all of his opponent's pieces on the board are down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
