							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Iron Justice: The Half-Man/Half-Train Chimera</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People along the Transcontinental Railroad have heard stories of Iron Justice; tales of a half-man/half-machine that travels along the tracks. A neighbor claims they once saw a shadowy figure following behind a train coming in from Omaha. The woman at the General Store says that she once heard Iron Justice chased off a group of rail bandits. The Captain of the Garrison denies that Iron Justice is real, but sends patrols out every night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Character Cache is a collection of characters designed to be used in tabletop RPG gaming, either as character concepts for players or as NPCs/villains by GMs. Artist Matt Morrow illustrates the character pieces, and Encoded Designs writes a system-neutral description, including how to incorporate this character into your campaign. These write-ups also include hooks for encounters and adventure inspiration, plus tags for quick reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the system-neutral write-up are stat blocks for:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Fate Core&lt;br/&gt;    Savage Worlds&lt;br/&gt;    5e&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
