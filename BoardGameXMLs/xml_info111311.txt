			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the Echo is a rhythm/RPG independent game developed by Iridium Studios and released for download through Xbox 360 and Steam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During combat, the player needs to swap between three different Stepmania/Dance Dance Revolution-style screens, one which restores mana, one which you use to launch attacks, and one that you use to defend. In addition, battles have a time limit in which you need to defeat the enemy. There are three difficulty levels for the combat for rhythm-game beginners as well as more experience players. RPG elements include enemies dropping items and item crafting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior to March of 2015 the game was published under the name Sequence but was renamed to Before the Echo after a legal claim by Jax Ltd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
