							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bubble Tanks 3</name>
									
			<description>Bubble Tanks 1 was designed around some simple concepts: make a game that 1) allowed you to grow, 2) explore and constantly experience new things, and 3) choose your difficulty as you play by deciding how far out you want to go. Bubble Tanks 3 is the completion of that vision- New tanks will stream into your game seamlessly in the background creating a new experience and adventure each and every game.&lt;br/&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t begin to tell you how much blood and sweat went into this game, but I can sum it up best with a story about our team member Jason. This past Sunday Jason was driving 2 hours from his girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s place to come in to work. Michigan is very cold, and his truck hit a patch of ice and he rolled the truck over. He was upside down for 10 minutes until the police and medics could cut him out of his truck. He was alright, no scratches or bruises somehow, so when the medic asked him where to drop him off, instead of the hospital he said &amp;ldquo;Hero Interactive so I can work on Bubble Tanks!&amp;rdquo; I tell you this for two reasons: 1) God saved Jason so he could bring you this game. 2) That&amp;rsquo;s how hard we ALL worked on it.&lt;br/&gt;We hope you all enjoy it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
