			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ritual is a strategic tile-laying game of magical dominance for two to five players. In Ritual you take on the role of a powerful wizard joining with other wizards to perform an intricate ritual of magic. Being a wizard, you must take this opportunity to prove once and for all that YOU are the best wizard by having the most influence over the ritual at its completion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At its heart Ritual is about three things: tiles, runes and influence. Being a tile-laying game, Ritual&amp;rsquo;s core mechanic revolves around drawing hexagonal tiles one at a time from a common pool known as the ley line and placing them onto the scroll that serves as the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each tile has three parts know as rune pieces. Throughout the game players try to match up identical rune pieces in groups of three known as runes. Runes players create can be activated to cause powerful effects capable of reshaping the board, but such power comes at a cost: influence. Each player gets a set of colored cubes known as influence cubes. These cubes are not only used to activate runes, but also to determine where you can play on the scroll and to tally your final score. Clever use of tiles, runes and influence is essential to winning a game of Ritual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ritual&amp;rsquo;s simple gameplay, deep strategy and beautiful presentation make it a fun game for beginners and experienced board-gamers alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
