			<description>A city building board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on an 8x8 grid or chess board. The playing pieces consist of a set of 24 Zone counters in a different color for each player and a set of 16 Landmark counters. Each Landmark is marked with a Prestige Point value and each Zone counter is marked with an Access Point value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Landmarks are randomly placed on the board. The players then take turn placing Zone counters until all the spaces on the board are filled or no player can place a Zone counter. Control of Landmarks is then determined. The player controlling the Landmarks having the highest total Prestige Points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
