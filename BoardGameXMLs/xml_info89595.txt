			<description>Game box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Thinker is a sliding block puzzle that is guaranteed to give you weeks of absolute hell. (Even the programmer can't solve it without his 'crib sheet'!) If you value your sanity, don't buy this game. It makes the Rubic Cube look simple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to remove the large red block through the hole at the bottom of the puzzle. This is achieved by moving the blocks into spaces left by the movement of other blocks. On skill leves 2-5, if you take too long to make your move, the computer will move a block of its choice. (This will always be against the best interest of the player.) The higher the skill level, the less time you have to make your move. If you make an illegal move, the computer will warn you. Do it too often and you are in for a nasty surprise. When the frustration gets too great, send a SAE stating where and when&lt;br/&gt;you bought the game and we will send you the solution. But please don't ask unless you have been trying for at least a month!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
