			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A dark star fell from the sky bringing with it the end of all things! The sanctity of the world known as Abaddon was shattered when a global apocalyptic event of a meteor impacting the planet causing a destructive ecological and eldritch change. Now there is no day or night, just never ending Apocalypse.  Races of Obsidian Apocalypse: Flesh and Iron adds four new races to the Obsidian Apocalypse campaign setting making the world even more interesting and just as dangerous. Are you willing to take up the fight?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this book you will find you will find updates to the standard races (Dwarves, Elves, Gnomes, Halflings, and Humans), in addition, seven all-new races for Races of Obsidian Apocalypse include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Exalted: The exalted are the direct offspring of angelic outsiders mated with the humans of Abaddon.&lt;br/&gt;    Genesai: Genesai are the result of demonic outsiders mating with angelic outsiders, defying all that both sides of the eternal conflict between good and evil consider inviolate.&lt;br/&gt;    Harrowed: The harrowed are one of the most despised and feared races of Abaddon. They are no less than the result of the unholy and abominable union between mortal humanoids and the foul undead.&lt;br/&gt;    Infernal: Infernals are the offspring of demonic outsiders and humanity upon Abaddon or the result of a tainted bloodline throwing up a child bearing the mark of past transgressions of natural law.&lt;br/&gt;    Khymer: The khymer are a people reduced to a pool of alien blood. They have been infused with powerful psionic energy, but depend upon corpses as vessels to travel in. Without host corpses, they are vulnerable, exposed to extremes of heat and cold and unable to hold weapons or wear armor.&lt;br/&gt;    Lykian: Abaddon&amp;rsquo;s werewolf lycanthropes, most commonly called lykians, are one of the most unusual residents of the world. Unlike standard lycanthropes, lykians are born as lycanthropes.&lt;br/&gt;    Osirian: According to ancient lore, the osirians were the first intelligent species to emerge on Abaddon, chosen by the gods to be their first creation on this world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
