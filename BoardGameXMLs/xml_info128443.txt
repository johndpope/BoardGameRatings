			<description>There are 36 square cards, 4 cars and a special die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players form a road with the cards laying them on the board, look at these 2 minutes and then turn these face-down&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to be the first to go through the complete course. The player rolls the dice in his turn. The value indicates how many fields he can &amp;quot;guess&amp;quot; to get ahead. For each card that he wants to drive, he must first indicate whether or not the asphalt after being uncovered. Is it true, then moved his car and continues. If He makes a mistake, the car remains last card and and the card is turned back face- down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
