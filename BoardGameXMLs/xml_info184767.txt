			<description>This is the fastest, most accurate basketball game on the market today. Zone and man-to-man defenses are your options. You become coach and player at the same time. Learn to recognize all types of offenses and defenses as you try to outscore your opponent. A mobile spinner decides your position on the court - you determine your game strategy. Both offensive &amp;amp; defensive rebounds occur; shots are blocked and shots are made, fouls are committed and foul shots are taken; you may take the hook shot, jump shot, or set shot and you may dribble, pass or shoot. A scoreboard is provided for score, quarters, and time outs. You determine your own defense and what offense to use against your opponent. Call the shots yourself when you play Advantage Basketball. (from brochure)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is advanced through a special &amp;quot;mobile spinner&amp;quot; with a different disk for each position on the court, the detailed playbook and strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
