			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Right Under Our Noses brings you face to face with the legendary city of Bluffside! Converted by Hal Greenberg, Derrick Landwehr and Peter J. Schroeder for Castles &amp;amp; Crusades Right Under Our Noses is the perfect teaser for what's to come. Written for the classic d20 system in the days of yore Bluffside City on the Edge was an instant classic. So while you are waiting for that, take a look at what ou are in store for!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Right Under Our Noses is a short 1-2 night adventure designed for a party of four 4th level characters, and is set in the Bluffside Campaign Setting. This adventure features locations and NPCs which are detailed in the Bluffside: City on the Edge (3.5) sourcebook. It takes place in and around an old sewer dumping station controlled by shady steam gnomes. They have disturbed a delicate ecological balance and the results are now affecting others as a horrid stench is sickening people in the streets above. The party investigates the issue, only to find the gnomes have bitten off more than they can chew, and it is up to our heroes to find a solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
