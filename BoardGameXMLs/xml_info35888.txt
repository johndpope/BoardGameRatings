							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Professor Quizzle&#039;s Quiz Wizard Trivia</name>
									
			<description>This is another game that was created in the early 80's to ride the coat tails of the success of Trivial Pursuit.  There is no board, so you have to keep track of your correct answers on the handy included notepad.  The trivia questions are on very looking familiar cards, and each card also has a category associated with it - go figure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most interesting thing about the game is the cute little cartoon of Professor Quizzle printed on the otherwise plain box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
