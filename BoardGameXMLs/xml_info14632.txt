			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick! Name the popular pair who went up the hill to fetch a pail of water. Right! Jack and Jill. Now name the 'paired up' parts of the American flag. Right again! Stars and Stripes. Get the idea? But you have to be Fast and Furious because you're in an Out -and-out race against the clock. Guess a pair correctly and win a chip. Be the first player to cover a row of squares on your board with chips and you're the winner, Fair and square! So gather all of your Friends and neighbors serve up the Cookies and milk. It's all Fun and games when you play Paired up junior! Paired Up Junior is a fast-moving game that promotes cooperative play, and encourages thinking and self-expression. Players get randomly 'paired up' with other players and take turns acting out or describing the pairs on the game cards, using their own words or actions. Paired Up Junior is generally played with 3 to 6 players but can be easily modified for 2 players or teams. A PARENTS' CHOICE APPROVED award winner. Dr. Toy's Best Vacation Children's Product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
