			<description>The first 140-card expansion for the Ophidian 2350 CCG, Rise of Champions continues the storyline for Ophidian and introduces new gladiators, additional level cards for some gladiators from the original set, new effects, new card types, and more! This series is offered in 30-count booster displays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately a printed expansion never got green light as the publisher Fleer/Skybox International has announced that '...based on current market conditions,' it is canceling its Rise of Champions booster for the Ophidian 2350 CCG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In making the announcement, Fleer Senior VP Sales and Marketing Lloyd Pawlak noted Fleer's inability to get retailer support as the determining factor in ending new release support for the game. 'The strong core support of our players and volunteers and the only 5 star gameplay rating for CCGs in Scrye this year... was not enough to convince more retailers to carry and support the game,' he said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fleer Director of Gaming Initiatives David Chase told ICv2 that not all support for the game is ending.'We are still soliciting sales for Ophidian 2350,' he said.'Ophidian still runs Organized Play along with supporting various conventions with product and tournament support.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And due to the Fan support, Ophidian Inc, the creators/designers of the game, managed to release the expansion as a print and play version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
