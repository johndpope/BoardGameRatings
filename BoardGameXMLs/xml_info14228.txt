			<description>TAMEGA (Tactical Memory Game) is played using 44 wooden tokens (22 pairs with matching illustrations) and 1 special 'bridge' token which is placed in the center of the board. The other pieces are randomly placed face-down on the remaining spaces. Each player gets a pawn and places it on top of a face-down token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A turn consists of moving towards a face-down token and turning the token in the space you just left face-up. You cannot move towards face-up tokens or empty spaces. You can move over the bridge token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the revealed illustration does not match another one on the board, play passes towards the next player.&lt;br/&gt;If the illustration on the token you just turned face-up matches another face-up illustration on the board you remove both pieces and turn the other face-up tokens face down. You may then place the bridge token to a free location of your choice and turn another token of your choice face up and resume play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when no player can make a legal move. The winner is the player who has the most matching pairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is for sale in Belgium, all proceedings go towards a go cause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
