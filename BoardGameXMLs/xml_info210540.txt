			<description>Count Antonov, concerned about his fianc&amp;eacute;e&amp;rsquo;s mental state, has invited you to Saint Petersburg. Enter Doctor Hawthorn, a well-known psychiatrist from London.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of a business meeting with the Count, you witness his demise at the very hands of the girl he loved. With her heart shattered in pieces, she gets taken away by two shady gentlemen &amp;ndash; but not before she tells you she didn&amp;rsquo;t do it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you&amp;rsquo;ve seen her do it &amp;ndash; it should be cased closed! But something&amp;rsquo;s wrong, as you begin to uncover the master-plot of purest manipulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A bloody track of these lethal letters, used to orchestrate the attacks, is long and hard. Prepare yourself for your biggest case yet, as you have to find the master &amp;ndash; in order to save the puppets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
