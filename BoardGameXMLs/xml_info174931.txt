			<description>Box Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blue Ice is definitely not the typical game you are used to playing with: in fact it is barely possible to compare it with another computer game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the artistic environment that appeals for all senses, players will have to explore the world of Icia to find how to enlighten Edward LCCXII to the beauty of the world and teach him how to feel sensations. The various locations of the game are each a work of art in which you need to find what is hidden inside. Along with the surprising graphics, Blue Ice also features an astonishing musical environment mixing classical, jazz and new age soundtracks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Unique characters each with their own personalities&lt;br/&gt;- Endless puzzles to test your brain&lt;br/&gt;- 30 digitised music tracks delivered in Q Sound&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
