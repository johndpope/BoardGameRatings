			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the final decades of the Age of Serpents, the great cyclops empire of Ghol-Gan descended into brutal decadence and apostasy. The cyclopes abandoned their ancient worship of the sun and the moon and turned to cannibalistic rites and unholy magic. Those few cyclopes who managed to resist the descent into madness and violence had to be careful in order to avoid being slain and devoured by their wicked brethren. Most of the legacy of this vile period was lost to the waves during Earthfall, but the eastern outposts of the empire survived in what became known as the Kaava Lands, still steeped in corruption. One of these profane complexes, Kaddodi, was colonized during the Age of Darkness by a powerful asura named Parveen, who sought enlightenment through meditation on the cyclopes&amp;rsquo; blasphemy. During her millennium of contemplation, lesser asuras flocked to her banner like hyenas to a rotting carcass, and Parveen reached her apotheosis as a mighty asurendra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
