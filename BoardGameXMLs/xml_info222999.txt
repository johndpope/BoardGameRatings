			<description>Publisher summary&lt;br/&gt;It's Not My Fault is a one-shot-in-a-box character and situation generator for Fate Accelerated!&lt;br/&gt;With just a few minutes and a few cards you'll create a group of fantasy characters in one crazy, mixed-up predicament, where everybody and nobody is to blame for getting them there. Good for a few hours of fun, convention-style one-shot play or simply as a quick, five-minute character creation exercise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck contains 20 character nudges, and three 14-card sets to answer Where Are You Now? What Brought You To This? and How Is It About To Get Worse?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
