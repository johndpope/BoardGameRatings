			<description>Great heros walk the land. They alone have the power to lead their people to a better life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there was a time before these men and women were remembered for their deeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fate of a kingdom lies in your hands and you must choose a path to glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What cause will you fight for? Who will you leave behind? How will you be remembered?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hero's Banner: The Fury of Free Will is a fantasy roleplaying game about making life choices in a world filled with expectation. Your character consists, primarily, of three &amp;quot;influences,&amp;quot; or possible life callings. These might include anything from choosing to marry for love instead of political gain to choosing the life of a soldier over that of a courtly diplomat. Whatever the character is struggling with, he spends his time forming alliances and developing other connections to each influence. But with choice comes loss. As your character slowly progresses towards an inevitable end he will lose friends and ability along the way. The more he specializes, the better he becomes, but also the more he must give up. And eventually, he will have to abandon two of his influences altogether - making one final choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
