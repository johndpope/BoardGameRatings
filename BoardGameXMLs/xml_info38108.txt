							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quest for the Old Ones</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;Card game based on the Elf Quest Universe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls a tribe of elves, choosing from one of four types: Wolf Riders, Sun Folk, Blue Mountain Gliders, or Go-Backs. Tribes may include Character Members (represented by cards) and non-character members (represented by tokens). Each member of a tribe represents one Elf and, if it has one, its Bond Beast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The custom card deck used in the game contains the following types of cards: Character, Land, Weapon Aid, Magic Aid, Ally Aid, Encounter, Food, and Event Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;To win you must awaken the Old one. To do this you must travel a distance of 15 land cards. The last land you place must be a Mountain or Tundra (The Frozen Mountains). The last land you place is considered to be an entrance to the &amp;lsquo;Palace&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo; Once there, the player must defeat the Guardian Trolls. The first player to do so wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
