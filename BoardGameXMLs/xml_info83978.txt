			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This set of rules allows you and a few mates to go rummaging around in old ruins looking for sacred texts, the Hair Lip of St. Ravell, treasures of a lost age or just about anything else you fancy. Most of all, it gives you a set of simple, fast and enjoyable skirmish rules for the late medieval or renaissance period. There is also, dare I say it, an additional section which allows for more horrifying encounters in the ruins. Not for everyone, I know, but we enjoyed them and I hope that you do too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play, you will need 2d10 and 2d6, a ruler marked in inches, two or more sets of around 8-10 figures and some sort of ruin or building model.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These relatively simple rules cover both combat and searching for items in the ruins. Rules set includes melee and ranged attacks, armor values, morale, etc. Each side gets a pool of points with which to buy a small skirmishing force. Each unit gets outfitted with armor and weaponry (with more effective items costing more). Set also comes with an appendix for Horror/Fantasy game play, which introduces undead creatures, spell casting, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules set appears in Wargames Illustrated #161 (February 2001)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
