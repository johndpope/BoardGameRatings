							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ILLL - Intergalactic Lucha Libre League</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intergalactic Lucha Libre League is a game about creating shared stories and universe with your friends. It's not about how many dice you roll for that Slam, but when, why and how your character lifted up his rival. It's the classic good and evil struggle told inside of a ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Intergalactic Lucha Libre League, there are two ways of making said struggle happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player will play the role of the &amp;quot;Intergalactic Booker&amp;quot;, set up matches and non-wrestling segments, create feuds, set up schemes and build the stage for the Playing Characters to shine. Those characters can be generated randomly or created by the players themselves, picking one of the four Space Races and Wrestling Classes and further customize their characters by selecting traits and Movesets that set them apart from the competition as well developing their unique signature and finisher moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Showtime&amp;quot; section of the book is all about gimmick matches, creating your own federation, your own belts, or using pre-existing federations sprinkled into the Solar System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the action is not limited to the ring! In their quest for fame, Sports Adventures may happen between shows - Or as the main attraction! While the wrestlers cannot feed off the live crowd, they can still feel their Shinning Guts tensing up as their social media feed fills up of encouraging messages as they body slam Space Dragons into volcanoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is even a way of simulating matches between non-playable characters (meaning an Intergalactic Booker can keep tabs on the career of the Playing Characters rivals and friends) as well a &amp;quot;Soft Intergalactic Booker&amp;quot; mode that allows players to take turns setting up matches and playing minor characters, crafting a shared universe one powerbomb at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
