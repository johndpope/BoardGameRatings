							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kegler Kings</name>
									
			<description>Kegler Kings is stat-driven bowling game based on actual performances by PBA bowlers. The first edition covered the 1974 season. Later editions included Hall of Fame cards as well as generic bowler cards (e.g. 100-109 average band, 110-119, etc.) so that players could pit themselves against the bowling legends of the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is somewhat of a curiosity, as the first edition was stamped VOID across its &amp;quot;Endorsed by PBA&amp;quot; claim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
