			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Off the Beaten Path is a collection of five short adventures for 5th Edition Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons but can also be easily adapted for other game systems. Though stats are provided for 5th edition you can easily adapt these adventures for other game systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A careless wizard tries and fails to summon a powerful devil from a nearby tower while the players are traveling down a nearby road. The players will experience a powerful explosion nearby and be assailed with rubble as the devil emerges from the rubble in front of them. The devil will tempt the players with a great reward if they will help free him. The players will be faced with an ethical decision of what to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is located in a remote wilderness area along a road traveling through the area. An ancient tower is located roughly half a mile north of the road on a small rise of hills. The location is very far from any settlements or civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
