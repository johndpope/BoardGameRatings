			<description>21 card expansion to add to your I'm the Boss!: The Card Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm the Boss! The Card Game is a game of creating and manipulating a deal so you can get the biggest &amp;ldquo;piece of the action&amp;rdquo;. If the cards don&amp;rsquo;t go your way, spoil a deal and frustrate your opponents by turning the deal from a big profit into a big loss. Through cunning deal-making, and favoring your &amp;ldquo;Cousins&amp;rdquo; (and by throwing in some guile and backstabbing too), acquire the most money to prove once and for all that you are &amp;ldquo;The Boss&amp;rdquo;!&lt;br/&gt;The game plays in a series of rounds with each round being a separate negotiation for a money-making deal. While playing cards, players can negotiate to encourage other players to make plays that are favorable to them. After a fixed number of such deals (rounds), the game ends and the player with the most money is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;(from Eagle Games webstore)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
