							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ogaden War: Ethiopia versus Somalia 1977-78</name>
									
			<description>The Ogaden war is one of the bloodiest wars ever fought in East Africa. This war starts on July 23, 1977 with an invasion of the Ogaden province of Ethiopia by Somalia. The Somalians quickly captured most of the Ogaden province but was defeated and thrown back to Somalia by a massive Soviet airlift of men and equipment and intervention by thousands of Cuban mechanized troops and large numbers of Soviet aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The war was important as not only did it show Soviet airlift and power projection capabilities but also proved dire for Somalia as it never recovered militarily from the war and led to the collapse of Somalia in the 90s which had consequences for the U.S.(Blackhawk Down) and Ethiopia(the current 2007 invasion) later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a heavily modified Iraq 2003 system (by Tetsuya Nakamura)laced with random events, a simple but detailed and effective air system, chit pull for Ethiopian reinforcement(to show the chaotic Ethiopian military system at the time), Somali supply situation and air interdiction etc. etc.etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is 18 turns long(two weeks per turn). Battalion level for both sides, Squadrons for air units(F-5s, Mig-21s, Canberras etc.). 270 counters total...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
