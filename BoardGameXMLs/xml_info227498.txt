			<description>OVERVIEW&lt;br/&gt;The GUVNOR is a gangster themed card trading game. Players trade crime cards simultaneously in order to gain RESPECT from the other players. The first player to win 30 RESPECT points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt nine random CRIME cards at the start of the game and seven REPECT points. The dealer starts the trading by shouting 'LET'S DO BUSINESS' after which all players may trade cards face down across the table. The first player to collect nine identical CRIME cards shouts 'AVE SOME OF THAT!' to win the round. The winner of the round becomes The GUVNOR and receives a win bonus (PROFIT). All the other players then pay The GUVNOR one RESPECT point from their pile. Any players caught RED HANDED (i.e. they have six or more identical CRIME cards in their hand) pay a penalty. The GUVNOR then takes a DECREE card from a wild deck - it may effect them directly or it may be used to hindered/help another player. The CRIME cards are then returned, shuffled and the next round begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
