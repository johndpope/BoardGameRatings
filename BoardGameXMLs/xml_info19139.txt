			<description>The philosophy behind ASLingo is for school-age children and students of ASL, hearing or deaf, with proper guidance from experienced ASL users, to utilize their cognitive and perceptive skills with their knowledge of ASL in an expressive and receptive manner. Instead of being too linguistic or didactic about teaching ASL in a structured environment, the children and adults can have fun together while learning pragmatically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of all, the players are engaged and delightfully attending to a bilingual game of bingo without stress. How many of us have learned basic economics, vocabulary and concepts through famous board games while cherishing the fond memories of playing with family and friends?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
