			<description>Undead Escape is a cooperative styled map building game designed for 2 to 5 players. In Undead Escape, one player plays as the human character, whose goal is to set enough fires to burn the zombie's factory to the ground. The remaining players will play as zombies doing everything they can to thwart the human player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is built using pieces of the factory floor, which includes 16 movement spaces and locations for items. Items are placed face down and must be discovered by the players and stored in inventory and eventually used or destroyed depending on their player type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombies will attempt to find newspapers and throw them into one of two water barrels randomly placed on the map. The human player attempts to find pieces needed to make fires, such as newspaper and matches, or a molotov cocktail. When the human player has enough items to start a fire, he must get to one of the fire locations on the map and light it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make things even more difficult for the human player, the zombies may also stash other items in their inventory, in which the player can only get back by attacking and winning a battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
