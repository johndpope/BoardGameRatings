			<description>From the publisher webpage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get the Goodies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's stuff&amp;mdash;good stuff, important stuff, stuff a lot of people want&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s stuck. Sitting where it can&amp;rsquo;t do anyone a bit of good. And to people who know how to make money from such things, the fact that the goods aren't moving is incredibly upsetting. Upsetting enough to make even the most kind-hearted individuals want to punch a baby seal in the face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goods aren't going to sit there forever, though. Plans are hatching to get the goods moving and out into the world. This being the Sixth World, those plans involve twists, turns, and the kind of complications that keep shadowrunners on their toes. But if they&amp;rsquo;re brave and resourceful enough, they might be able to make some money off the cargo sitting on the good ship Free Taiwan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free Taiwan is a free, completely playable mission compatible with Shadowrun, Twentieth Anniversary Edition. Load up your guns and check your calendars, since there are some days that make people even less trustworthy than they usually are&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;Although this was released for free on April 1st, it is a 100% legit adventure for the Shadowrun Missions. Aprils' Fools plays a littel part of it, but it's not a gag product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
