							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anzio The Bloodiest Beachhead</name>
									
			<description>On 22nd January 1944, Allied forces landed at Anzio, a small coastal town just 30 miles south of Rome. This attack behind enemy lines, was intended to unhinge the German fortified Gustav Line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Germans responded quickly, containing the beachhead. The fighting was bitter, with both sides suffering high casualties. Intense artillery bombardments, water filled trenches and muddy conditions, made this battlefield a wretched place. The Allies would be on their beachhead for four long months before they were able to breakout and meet up with the rest of U.S. 5th Army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game represents the first six weeks of this campaign. It was a period when both sides attacked each other vigorously, looking for opportunities to  break through the enemy defences, while desperately resisting enemy advances. By the beginning of March, both sides had fought each other to a standstill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Anzio rules bring differential based combat, single stacks attacking single stacks, Random Events, random strength Allied bombardments, historically based special abilities for some formations, anti tank values, bog checks for off road movement and disengagement tests when attempting to leave an enemy ZOC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The presentation includes Large hexes and large counters to enhance the playing experience. The counters are provided on self adhesive paper and require the user to mount them onto card prior to cutting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
