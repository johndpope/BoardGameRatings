			<description>Yamodo Party Time is the award-winning game of made-up words that will keep everyone laughing. Played in quick rounds, players scramble to create their &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; definition to a made-up word and theme with the hope of being picked by the judge. Be creative, be quick, but when time runs out, the Spindoodler is spun, and the consequences (like having to pass your card) only add to the fun. Write a funny definition, add a quick doodle, and feel free to lobby the judge on why your definition is best. Every round has a new judge, word and theme, so you never know what your mind will draw out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Source: Yamodo.com]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
