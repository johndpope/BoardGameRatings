			<description>Sub-Space is a collection type game with an adult BDSM theme.  Each person is a Dominant, and randomly draws a submissive card.  Each submissive has 3 items that you need to put your submissive into Sub-Space (AKA Win).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can play items on their own turns, and can use special card to keep other players from stealing or breaking their items. Status cards can be used to swap hands, make other players miss turns, or let you take an extra turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two decks and the Box set.  The box set contains both Hard and Soft decks.  The difference in the decks is the aggressiveness of play and some of the artwork is a bit more pointed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of the theme this game is for ages 18+.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
