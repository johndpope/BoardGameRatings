							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Undermountain Adventures: The Citadel Adaptation</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday, you were visited by a devout dwarf named Gyudd. He explained to you that he was an heir to the lost throne of Clan Melairkyn, a direct descendant of its last ruler, King Melair IV. He told you of strange dreams he was having of late &amp;ndash; dreams of a plain black crown bearing a blood-red gem. They have become more frequent and more vivid as he&amp;rsquo;s traveled closer to Belkram&amp;rsquo;s Fall, his old clan&amp;rsquo;s fallen ancestral home. He has taken these dreams to mean that obtaining the crown is the key to resurrecting his clan and possibly rebuilding the lost citadel in Belkram&amp;rsquo;s Fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure guide adapted the commercially published Expedition to Undermountain to RPGA convention/tournament timed play.  The commercial module is required to use this product.  Characters are assumed to be of 4th level, and for RPGA play must conform to guidelines given in Undermountain Adventures Character Creation Guide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
