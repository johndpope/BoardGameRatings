							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Magus: A Class of Martial Prowess and Magical Talents (5e)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magus: A human confronted by two orcs draws his rapier and, as he does, violet runes illuminate in the air around the weapon. He dodges one of the orc&amp;rsquo;s impatient attacks and punishes it with a thrust of his own that causes the air around the orc to burst into green flames and sends the orc sprawling to the ground. The second orc becomes noticeably less enthusiastic about the fight. A dwarf looks down from the mountain peak she calls home and sees the rampant destruction of the woods she has sworn to protect. As she approaches the hunting encampment responsible for the fire she calls woodland creatures to be her allies and her skin hardens to bark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Looking over the ancient heiroglyphs, a saurian searches frantically for details of a ritual that will uphold the mystic seal over his ancestral home. When the impossibly heavy doors swing open behind him, he turns to face the temple&amp;rsquo;s guardians as his sword erupts into flames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magi are mystical warriors who blend martial prowess with esoteric knowledge and spellcasting. Magi balance the pursuit of personal goals and relationships with their obligations to pursue the goals and ideals of the eldritch societies that initiated them into the magical arts. Although their backgrounds may sometimes set them at odds against one another, magi are united by their commitment to a cause greater than themselves and a drive to master their magical abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
