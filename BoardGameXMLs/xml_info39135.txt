							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Red vs. Gray</name>
									
			<description>Red vs. Gray is hex-and-counter wargame without a historical background. It is relatively light and plays in about an hour, although the time will depend not only on the speed of the players but their style of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Counter density is low at ten units per player. The rules are less than five pages and should be easily picked up by those familiar with hex-and-counter games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a few unique elements in the rules. Including conditional casualties in the combat resolution table, and a distinct endgame phase triggered when one side loses a certain amount of combat strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
