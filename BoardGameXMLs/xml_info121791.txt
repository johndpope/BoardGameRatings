			<description>Smuggler's Run 2: Hostile Territory is a video game released for the PlayStation 2. It is a sequel to the game Smuggler's Run. Like the first game the player is a smuggler trying to deliver illegal cargo to destinations within 3 large maps in the game using several different types of vehicles to make deliveries in a given amount of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was originally supposed to take place in Afghanistan but following the attacks on the World Trade Center and the subsequent invasion of Afghanistan, the developers changed the Afghanistan levels to the deserts of Georgia, Soviet/Russia instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to the original game, the overall objective in most missions is to deliver illegal contraband from a pick-up to a drop-off spot in a given amount of time. The player would also have to avoid local army and border patrol during these missions. Now, players will also have to follow vehicles without being seen, destroying enemy vehicles, and evading police after all other objectives are finished. The player will be given a number of vehicles to choose from. There are the following game modes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smuggler's missions Turf war -- Within this is Crooks 'n Smugglers, Loot Grab and Bomb Tag Checkpoint Races Joyridin' Bonus Missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;he game takes place in three locations with the player working for a small smuggling company named Exotic Imports (EI or EXO for short). The story focuses on the activities and objectives given by The Colnel to EI. It starts in Russia, where the player finds out who they are working for and the basics of the game. Then, after being told to leave immediately from the area by Shodi (The main client) to Vietnam, Exotic Imports then learns of the CIA being involved after the Russians track 2 KG of Weapons Grade Plutonium. This takes you back to Russia, where Frank (Your Boss) asks the Colnal what is happening with the &amp;quot;nukes&amp;quot; and involvment from the CIA. Frank, only caring for money, agrees to continue smuggling nuclear devices. However, the rest of EI decide not to, and try to stop a missile which would cause WWIII. This reveals the Colnels intentions, and Frank escapes with all the passwords, showing his plans. EI stop Frank, and then it shows the player flying off in a helicopter with a cheque for $100,501,000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Smuggler's Run 2: Hostile Territory&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
