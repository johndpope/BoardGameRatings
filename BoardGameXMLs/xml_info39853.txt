							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">King&#039;s Cottage</name>
									
			<description>The King has gathered his trusty advisers and has instructed them to build him a cottage down by the river. Of course it will have to be furnished as well. The advisers recognize this as a great opportunity for personal gain, and run off to shuffle their investments in the four local craft houses before the construction begins. Then as the cottage is still going up, the advisers scurry to furnish the place in the most expensive pieces that will best benefit their investments. Of course, the King is not a man to let his exquisite taste in decor go to waste, so after a couple of months he shows up to lend a hand, and some praise. After four months the cottage is completed and the craft houses receive their payments and the advisers collect their investments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
