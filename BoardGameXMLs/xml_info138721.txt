			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Nate, you do realize the entire building is looking for Parker? I mean the actual, physical building is looking for her. Look, any cameras that I piggy-back, any sensors that I access, anything I do to find Parker could lead the bad guys right to her.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;All right, so what's your play?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Wh-what's my play?? Nate, I'm hacking a security system the Pentagon calls overkill with a laptop I found in the back of my car!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- Alec Hardison &amp;amp; Nate Ford, The Inside Job&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introducing a new way to structure capers, giving a more tactical based approach to the game whilst still maintaining the flowing narrative elements that has proven such a strength of LEVERAGE. The node based structure models computer systems for the Hacker to infiltrate; physical locations for Hitters, Hackers, and Thieves to move through; and more abstract constructs representing the Marks power and channels of resources for the Mastermind to sabotage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the eighth in a new series of monographs featuring new rules and game support for the LEVERAGE ROLEPLAYING GAME based on the hit TV show on TNT. Officially licensed for your own private CrimeWorld!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
