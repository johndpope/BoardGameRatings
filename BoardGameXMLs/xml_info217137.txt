							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1-2-3 räknar Mamma Mu och Kråkan</name>
									
			<description>Swedish children's game based on the popular &amp;quot;Mamma Mu and Kr&amp;aring;kan&amp;quot; series. Translation: &amp;quot;1-2-3 counts Mama Mu and the Crow&amp;quot;. The main object of the game is to teach young children to count.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has two spinning wheels and ten areas numbered one through ten. Players take turns spinning the first wheel to get a number between one and ten. They then move their piece to that space. After that they spin the second wheel, which will tell them what they need to do (clap hands, jump on one leg). After the player has performed the task the same number of times as the number they first landed on, they are awarded a medal. The first player to a certain amount of medals win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
