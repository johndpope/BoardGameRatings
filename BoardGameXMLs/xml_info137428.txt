			<description>Promotional item for Ernsting's Family, a large chain of fashion shops in Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game mixes trivia questions (with a bit of tasks thrown in) and set collecting. The idea is to pack a suitcase with 5 matching cards /same colour).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player gets 5 cards and 5 cards are dealt question side up in the middle of the table. In a turn, a player chooses one of the question cards and a question on it that he would like to try to answer. If he is right, he gets the card. He can never have more than 7 cards so any extra card over that must be discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player gets 3 matching cards (3 items, 2 items plus a suitcase) then he must lay down the set in front of him. Jokers can be used to represent one item of clothing or they can be discared to claim one of the face-up cards without answering a question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First to get 6 matching cards (i.e. 1 suitcase and 5 items, all in one colour), wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
