							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bastion of the Giants</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For years the Verbeeg clan on Clover Island has lived peacefully with the human settlement of Corsair Bay. A peace treaty has remained in effect that both groups attested to and have lived by. Recently the annual tribute that is to be paid to the giants has not come and now the giants are preparing for battle. Can your party go and act as an envoy to the giants or will they choose to go to war against them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for an upper level group of adventurers.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
