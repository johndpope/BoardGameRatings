			<description>This abstract game is the best brain exercise for the whole family. To win, you must score as many points as possible while blocking your opponents' winning moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to score points by aligning the color of your tokens in rows, columns, diagonals and squares of four positions. The game combined the concepts of Go, Reversi, Gomoku, Chess, Mahjong and tic-tac-toe. Players must observe not only the tokens on the game board (Qu-Mat), but also each player's tokens in possession. The game ends when a player exceeds the target score preset by the players prior to the game. Using a special scoring procedure, this game allows players to play with money instead of points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requires the Qu-MAT (sold separately) to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
