			<description>Squirrels is easy to learn and infinitely replayable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple to win: collect 5 nuts. But along the way your friendships will be tested as other players try to steal your nuts and foil your chances of winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a variety of wild cards to change your circumstances at any moment, there's no telling who will be the winner at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you either play a card or discard a card. If a card was played, you resolve the effect and draw back up to 7 cards. If you discarded a card you simply draw back up to 7 cards. In either case, play continues to the next player in clockwise order. You win the game if you have 5 nut cards of the same color in your hand at the end of your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
