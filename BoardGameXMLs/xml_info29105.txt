							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Royal Battles</name>
									
			<description>Royal Battles is a strategic board game of small scale battles played with playing cards and chess pieces. In Royal Battles players compete to defeat each other in head-to-head combat. Each player builds an army of 4 units (represented with chess pieces) and maneuvers them on a battle board made from a tile grid of playing cards. Each unit has a special ability that sets it apart and it is the combination of units and abilities that will determine the difference between victory and defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requires playing cards (standard poker or bridge decks) and chess pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
