							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Danger at the Walls</name>
									
			<description>It&amp;rsquo;s a well-worn story by now in the Land of Danger: An army attacking a castle. Somehow, though, the story keeps happening, and another bellicose mob has advanced on the imposing walls of someone else&amp;rsquo;s keep. The clash to control those walls is at hand. Lead the Blue attackers or the Red defenders, using clever card play and a touch of luck to control more sections of the wall than your opponent&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 54 cards -- 5 walls, a Red personal deck of 8 cards, a Blue personal deck of 8 cards, and a main deck of 33 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns playing Archer, Cannon, Attack, Leader and Flag cards from their hands to the different walls. Archers &amp;amp; Cannons each have a strength value, and the player with the most total strength at a wall controls it. Attacks remove the opponent's cards, Leaders each have a unique ability that impacts how strength is calculated at a wall, and Flags lock down the control of a wall and trigger the end game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controlling the most walls at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
