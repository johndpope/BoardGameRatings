			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Words*Words is a 1989 text-based DOS port of the boardgame Jotto.  The game was freeware, and still works in Windows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The opening screen contains instructions, then the next screen allows you to choose a game, numbered from 1-250.  The game then begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you type in a five-letter word and the program responds with how many of those letters are in its secret word that you're trying to guess.  You have 18 guesses in order to narrow down the word to the correct solution.  If you find the correct solution, the program usually rewards you with a witty or pithy quotation including the word.  Sometimes it simply tells you how hard the word is to guess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By pressing the F7 or F9 keys you can keep track of which letters you've determined are in the word or are definitely not in the word.  The F3 and F5 keys allow you to return letters to the &amp;quot;undetermined&amp;quot; pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
