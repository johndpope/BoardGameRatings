							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Laurel and Hardy-opoly</name>
									
			<description>This -opoly variant of the greatest comedy team of all time has been painstakingly researched. Each property group is a genre of films. For example, there is the Sailors property group, On the lam from the law, the in trouble with the wives group, etc. Of course you go to the Hoosegow, and you start out with a &amp;quot;Perfect Day&amp;quot; as when you start the film. Each property named after one of their films, on the back of the property is the release date of the film, who starred in it, etc. This entire game is a film buffs dream. Each card in the two decks referes also to one of their films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
