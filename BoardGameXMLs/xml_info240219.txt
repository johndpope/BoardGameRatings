			<description>From RPGNow.com:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three authors. Three chilling tales of malevolence and inhuman appetite for The Cthulhu Hack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wolves in the Mountain by Richard August&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A man staggers into an isolated town with a story of murder and madness. A small group ventures into the wilderness, in search of the truth. But out in the mountains there lies something darker and stranger than they can possibly imagine... and blood. Lots and lots of blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lovely, Dark and Deep by John Almack&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wherein the investigators go on a hunting trip in the Canadian wilderness, but soon wonder who is the hunter and who the prey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tainted Meat by Paul Baldowski&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Out in the deep woods, a tiny settlement has fought to survive and won. When the travelling investigators arrive, they find proud, tough people and are welcomed with warmth and hospitality. Hard times behind them, why would anyone want to leave?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed as stand-alone investigation adventures, suited to running as one-shots or over two sessions. Written for The Cthulhu Hack, adaptable to any game of investigation horror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
