			<description>The object of the game is to be the first to move all nine of your pawns from your own &amp;quot;home intersections&amp;quot; to those of your opponent.  The playing board is made up of 17 thin strips, which can be slid left or right to transport pieces laterally.  Pieces may move to adjacent intersections, jump adjacent pieces, and make &amp;quot;long jumps&amp;quot; covering a greater distance.&lt;br/&gt;The main game uses a die to determine how many moves a player may make on his or her turn.  A variation, included in the game directions, removes the die by adding a schedule of moves per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
