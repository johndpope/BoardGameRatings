							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">World Cup Cricket</name>
									
			<description>World Cup Cricket is touted as &amp;quot;The original action-packed table-top cricket game!&amp;quot; for Ages 4 and up.&lt;br/&gt;In the box (decorated with action shots of late 80s / early 90s players including Alec Stewart and Jack Russell) comes with a green beize (?? beige) playing area which is laid out on a table, with six boundary fence sections which Velcro around the edge to act as the boundary and prevent the ball flying off around the room. The batsman attached at one end and the bowler to the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pitch (although octagonal) resembles an archery target -the closer to the boundary and further from the batsmen, the higher the ring value. Directly in front of the batsmen is an area worth no runs, outside of that 1 run, then a ring worth 2 runs and the outer area worth 3 runs. Hitting the fence gets 4 runs and there are four small areas jutting out of the boundary worth 6 runs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bowling player places fielders (with a catching 'cup' between their legs) around the field in an attempt to 'catch' the batsman out. Bowling is achieved by loading the ball into the bowler's cupped hand and pushing down on the front arm, causing the ball to roll down a ramp towards the batsman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The batsman is controlled with cord attached to the bat. The batting player pulls back the cord, releasing it in time to hit the approaching ball. Whichever area the ball is hit to is the number of runs the player gets.&lt;br/&gt;Batsmen can be out by being caught by the bowler, by hitting the ball between the legs of the fielders into their 'cups', by the ball hitting the stumps behind the batsmen or by the batsman edging the ball into the &amp;quot;wicket keeper&amp;quot; which is attached to the batting stand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are earlier versions of the game where the batting action is different and the players less detailed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
