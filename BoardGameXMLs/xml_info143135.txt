			<description>Three Dice Brick is a very addictive high scoring dice game in which one or more players roll for points. The player with the highest score of 3,000+ points in the final round of play wins the game. Once a player has achieved a winning point total of 3,000+ points each other player has one last turn to score enough points to surpass that high-score. Otherwise, any roll of the dice which results in a Sudden Death scoring combination is an automatic loss unless the other player throws a Single 1 scoring combination to reset the game. Three Dice Brick is played similarly to Six Dice Farkle, Cee-Lo and Cosmic Wimpout with a few variations. It comes with custom designed three translucent glow-n-the dark dice in a small clear plastic bag, score sheet and comprehensive instruction manual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gambling Style:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a gambling game Three Dice Brick can arouse a great deal of excitement if played for a small stake. Each one of the players must contribute a similar fee to the pot. The one who finishes first wins the pot. There is no second place money and/or prizes! For those interested in the bar/club version of Three Dice Brick&amp;trade; it&amp;rsquo;s often played to determine a loser who must buy drinks for the other player(s), e.t.c.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tournament Style:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three Dice Brick&amp;trade; tournaments can be held at house parties, local taverns, high school/college campuses, churches, clubs/bars, recreational facilities, civic centers, social networking sites, e.t.c. for whatever prize award individual Three Dice Brick&amp;trade; clubs deem appropriate and winners can be awarded championship status or titles (i.e. Three Dice Brick King, Brick Master, Three Dice Brick Champion, e.t.c.). Three Dice Brick tournaments can be played by having players compete at several tables- with the winners at each table advancing to a final table for a Three Dice Brick head-to-head championship. The tournament feature of Three Dice Brick is especially entertaining for evening events at night since the dice are glow-n-the dark it makes for fun and competitive tournament play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
