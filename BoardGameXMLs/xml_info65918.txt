			<description>Appearing in the pages of Britain-based G.M. Magazine (Issue 5 - Jan 1989), Ruck Da House is a game that features 2 players and a referee. One player takes the role of a family of Goblins and the other, a party of adventuring Raiders. The Raiders break into a house occupied by the Goblins in search of treasure... and mayhem quickly ensues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subtitle of the game is &amp;quot;A Light Hearted Game of Homicide for the Less Discerning Gamer,&amp;quot; and most of the mechanics revolve around fighting and killing. The referee is needed to adjudicate the hidden movement which is most prominent in the early phases of the game. As the Raiders and Goblins search for each other, players plot their movement using a coordinate system laid out at the edges of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map comes as an insert in the magazine and the counters are to be cut out and mounted on a suitable material (such as cardstock).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If player are willing to share control of the two factions, then more than 3 players can play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
