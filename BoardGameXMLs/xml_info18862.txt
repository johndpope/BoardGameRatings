			<description>From the directions: A lightning fast game for 2 or 3 players.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to move all three of a player's marbles around the board from base position to &amp;quot;home safe&amp;quot;. Each player rolls his dice once to determine who plays first. Player rolling the highest number is first and chooses his color, placing the three marbles in &amp;quot;base&amp;quot; position. Play will proceed to the left, each player choosing his color and placing his three marbles in his &amp;quot;base&amp;quot; position. With all marbles now in &amp;quot;base&amp;quot; position, first player rolls his die. Either a one or a six must be rolled to take a marble from base to &amp;quot;start&amp;quot; location marked by single hole of the player's color. Players roll their die in turn, moving marbles which have been started the exact number of places permitted by number rolled. When a one or a six is rolled, player has choice of moving a &amp;quot;started&amp;quot; marble that number of spaces or starting a new marble. Also, the rolling of a six entitles that player to an additional turn IF he was able to use the six he just rolled. As play proceeds, a player may not pass or land on a marble of his own color. However, when a player's move lands his marble on a space occupied by another's marble, he may JOLT by replacing that marble with his own. The JOLTED player must then re-start the marble from his &amp;quot;base&amp;quot; position. Marbles are ALWAYS subject to JOLTING until in &amp;quot;safe home&amp;quot;. First player with all three marbles &amp;quot;safe home&amp;quot; is winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With that being said (or rather written), sounds like Parchesi revisited...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
