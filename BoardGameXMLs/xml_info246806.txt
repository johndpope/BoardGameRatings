			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;his list is of 100 different items that could be found by players in a school chemistry lab. Although there are 100 items on the list, many of these can then be split into further items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the items that can be found are potentially dangerous, and could be used to create possibly useful things. These could be useful in a post-apocalyptic setting, whether this be a typical end of the world situation, zombie apocalypse or alien invasion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;38.
