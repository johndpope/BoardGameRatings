			<description>The zepuin on your shoulder flaps nervously as the giant tusks of a palgus wroth surface in the distance. It doesn't seem pleased with all the exchange of cannon fire. Neptune rises on the iceberg riddled coast. Someone put your loot on that ship, and the time to retaliate is running thin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview: Plundering Pluto is a dexterity, dice and deduction game pitting two seafaring K9 pirates against one another. The first player to destroy the three sectors of their opponents ship with their p.a.w.s. canon fire is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has three levels of play for various types of gamers. The introductory dexterity game simply builds the strength of ships by rolling the die, then taking turns firing cannon cards to subtract their values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next levels of gameplay introduce ship customization with weapons and icebergs. Finally, a bluffing, deduction card game may be used to add a strategic twist. The choice method to plunder Pluto is yours!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
