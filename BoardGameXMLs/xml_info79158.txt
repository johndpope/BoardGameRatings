			<description>Grab your musket and backpack and join Napoleon's legions as they march into Swabia to encircle the unfortunate General Mack. Continue on down the valley of the Danube as you pursue General Kutusov and his Russian hordes as they attempt to evade your mighty army. Capture Vienna and press on to meet up with destiny on the fields of Austerlitz where Napoleon won his greatest victory. The Sun of Austerlitz has never shone brighter than now as you embark on your conquest of the forces of the Third Coalition.&lt;br/&gt;    Campaign Austerlitz continues the fine tradition of excellence found in all of the titles in the Napoleonic Campaign series. The solo gamer will delight to find over fifty scenarios specifically designed to give them a tough battle.&lt;br/&gt;    In development for over three years there is a depth of design not found in any other game on this topic.

From Wertingen in October to each portion of the battle of Austerlitz the historical gamer will be in his glory as he attempts to defeat his foe on the same fields that saw the French rise to dominance in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ride with Murat as he advances boldly against Kutusov at Sch&amp;ouml;ngrabern or join up with Davout as he marches to destiny at Austerlitz.&lt;br/&gt;    Included are over 60 maps allowing the players to fight over the famous battlefields of 1805 as well as many in England.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Campaign Austerlitz contains many new features.
