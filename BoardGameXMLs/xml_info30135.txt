			<description>Junior Geni is a children's edition of the very popular Norwegian trivia game Geni, with simplified rules and different question categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this game is to answer one question correctly from each of the four categories, and then answer questions from two given categories, moving to the center of the board. The first player to reach the center is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally released in 1988, the game has been re-released with new questions and categories in 1995, 1998, 2000, 2003 and 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game typically contains 250 cards, all with questions from all four categories, including 'Books and music', 'Our world', 'Nature', 'Entertainment', 'Science', varying from the different editions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
