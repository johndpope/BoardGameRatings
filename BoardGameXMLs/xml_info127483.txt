			<description>Welcome to Tycoon 2. Happy Industrializing!&lt;br/&gt;This is the classic reiteration of the Monopoly so that it adds depth and fun to the game.. Happy Industrializing! Though it is a lot different than monopoly, but it is simple and elegant enough to understand the rules soon enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to hold the maximum asset values at the end of specific rounds of the game. (a round is actually a month in the game, and so usually 6 - 12 rounds/ half -yearly or annual game)&lt;br/&gt; Players will take the role of tycoons trying to maximize their growth potential by acquiring membership of cities of the world, purchasing ownership of industries, advanced industries and various services, playing the casino and making black money to aid their fundings, and finally, dominating the board to become the greatest tycoon of all times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been named Tycoon 2 since this is the reinvention of the beta one named: Tycoon - The game, which had fewer elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This board game is not publicly available, it is hand made at home, using paper money and other stuffs from other board games. The cards were printed and pasted on standard playing cards, and everything else was printed and published manually. =&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
