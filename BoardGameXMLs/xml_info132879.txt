			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hope Preparatory School is a privately funded institution dedicated to preparing tomorrow's metahumans for whatever paths might lie ahead. With a tradition that stretches back over 60 years,  a world-renowned faculty, and affiliations with all of the best universities, HPS is the place to send your child to prepare him or her for life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Members of the Artists Clique aren't necessarily focused on becoming traditional crime fighting vigilantes. Instead, these metahumans often want to do more with their abilities. Some, believe they may be able to serve humanity as scientists, politicians, or philosophers. Others pursue dreams of a career as a professional athlete or a performer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The HPS Artists Character Pack includes six fully statted members of the Artist clique for the Hope Preparatory School setting. The pack includes two Sophomores, two Juniors, and two Seniors. The characters may be used as PCs in scenarios, NPC class rivals, or a field trip group for a more traditional supers campaign. These characters are all PL8, PL9, and PL10, for use with the M&amp;amp;M3E rules. Printable character standups are also included as a substitute for tabletop gaming miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
