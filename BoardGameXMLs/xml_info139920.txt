							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sound Memory</name>
									
			<description>A modern twist on the traditional game of Memory. THere are 24 tiles featuring 12 pairs. The pairs are represented by appropriate sounds on the electric gadget (who is called Marvin the Mouse).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tiles are placed face down on the table and shuffled around. In a turn, a player presses the Green Arrow button on Marvin and a random sound will be heard. Now the player must look for the pair related to that sound. If successful, the player keeps the pair and presses the blue button on Marvin so that the same sound will not feature any more in the current game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 12 sounds are:&lt;br/&gt;Cat, Thunderstorm, Road-Drill, Church Bell, Dog, Children, Wind, Birds singing, Rain, Car-Horn, Barrel Organ and Footsteps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the most tiles after all the tiles have been matched.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
