			<description>&amp;quot;Many millions of years ago, on the planet Cybertron, life existed, but not life as we know it today. Intelligent robots that could think and feel inhabited the cities. They were called Autobots and Decepticons. But the brutal Decepticons were driven by a single goal: total domination. They set out to destroy the peace-loving Autobots, and a war between the forces of good and evil raged across Cybertron, devastating all in its path, draining the planet's once rich sources of energy. The Autobots, on the verge of extinction, battled valiantly to survive.&amp;quot; - The Opening Narration from &amp;quot;More Than Meets the Eye, Part I&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When an elite team of Autobots left Cybertron in search of energon, they were pursued by Megatron and his Decepticons. They crashed on Earth four million years ago and fell into a state of involuntary hibernation. Then, in 1984 they awakened, making Earth into a battlefield, with energon as the prize. Now the heroic Optimus Prime and his valiant Autobots must stop Megatron and the cruel Decepticons from plundering the Earth and fueling a war of galactic conquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transformers: Heavy Metal War is a card game that allows players to command their favorite Transformers from the first two seasons of the classic 1984 cartoon show. Each player must manage their hand and deploy Transformers with a variety of powers in order to complete missions, each giving the victor a unique reward. You will not only have the likes of Wheeljack, Jazz, Starscream, and Soundwave at your command, but also a host of lesser known Transformers, including Tracks and Reflector, as well as cards for human allies and unforeseen events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what are you waiting for? &amp;quot;Transform and roll out!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
