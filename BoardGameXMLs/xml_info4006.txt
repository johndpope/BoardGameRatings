							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">P.O.W. Rescue</name>
									
			<description>This is a pretty esoteric game. The object of the game is to rescue POW's from Viet Nam's infamous Hanoi Hilton. The first player to rescue and escape with a POW from the camp cell and reach the end of the rescue/escape route wins the game. The designer believed that POW's were still being held in North Viet Nam and apparently created this game to keep people aware of that fact. He comments &amp;quot; POW Rescue is an action game of rescue dedicated to those still held as POW with the hope that Americans will never forget those we left behind&amp;quot;. The rules for this very simplistic game are 3 very short pages in length.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
