							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game of Funny Conversation Cards</name>
									
			<description>While this 1906 question-and-answer game from Milton Bradley might seem to be a response to Parker Brothers' 1893 Komikal Konversation Kards, it actually owes more to the much earlier 1784 Comic Conversation Cards (unknown publisher).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the former provided questions and answers to be distributed randomly amongst a mixed group, the 18th century game specified that answers must be given by someone of the opposite sex from the questioner. Comic Conversation Cards is even more specific: the Gentleman asks the questions and the Lady provides the answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 24 Question cards in black and 24 Answer cards in red. Here is one example. One question: &amp;quot;Has mamma bought you a rubber dollie yet?&amp;quot; One answer: &amp;quot;I'll ask mamma, and let you know next Sunday afternoon&amp;quot;. A bit forward for a first date, wot?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
