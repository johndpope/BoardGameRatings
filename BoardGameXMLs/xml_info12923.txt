							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Three on a Match</name>
									
			<description>Based on the game show's original (1971-73) format, the emcee chooses four prizes and places three sets of three cards in the board; the last prize only has two cards put in, along with a &amp;quot;No Match&amp;quot; card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three categories are shown, and the players bid on how many true/false questions (1-4) they can answer. High bid plays the questions, while ties cancel out. The total number from the bids is multiplied by $10 and becomes the prize for the round (for example, 4-3-2 would be worth $90), although choosing a Double Pot category doubles the amount available (maximum of $220). Once a player answers a set of questions correctly and has at least $140 (the show required just $90), s/he may try to go to the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board contains four colored rows (Red-Green-Yellow-Blue) and three amounts ($20-$30-$40); the player in control calls out the money and color (i.e., &amp;quot;Forty on the Red&amp;quot;) and can buy as many boxes as possible until either matching or not having enough to buy appropriately, with one catch: a column is closed when three of its boxes are picked. Matching awards that prize's value to the player's score, and the first to $5,000 ($4,000 if only two people are playing the questions with an emcee) wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the first three picks of a game match, that player wins the prize and a jackpot which starts at $100 and increases by $100 each time it is not won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From April 1973 until the show's end in June 1974, the format changed to matching pictures; the first player to get three matches won the game and $5,000 in prizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
