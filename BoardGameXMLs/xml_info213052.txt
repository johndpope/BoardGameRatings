							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">PM GALAXY: A Project Management Board Game</name>
									
			<description>PM Galaxy is a collaborative and competitive board game for 3 to 5 players, where each player, alias &amp;bdquo;project manager&amp;rdquo;, takes control of a distinctive project. Although each project manager fights to be the first one to complete his or her project, these projects are interdependent and share, as it always happens, limited resources. The task of each project manager is to guide their projects through its phases, gathering resources by answering quizzes and investing those resources to overcome challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board game has been developed as a tool to facilitate the learning of project management concepts in a fun and engaging way. It is intended for project management trainers and consultants, project managers, project team leaders and team members. Basically, for all those involved in projects who want to improve their project management knowledge while having a great time together with their team!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
