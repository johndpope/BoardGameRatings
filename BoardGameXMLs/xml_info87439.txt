							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Harry &amp; Harry: La Bo√Æte de Rajmahal</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Los Angeles, 1930. George was just coming back home with the newspaper he just bought when two thugs jumped out of a car and kidnapped him, yelling &amp;quot;We've got da professor!&amp;quot;. George wakes up in a damp basement. He's tied to a chair and from the conversation he overhears, he'd better find a way out quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harry &amp;amp; Harry is a graphical text adventure game inspired by the film noir genre. Graphics are in black and white and the text uses a lot of slang words. Like a lot of other adventure games of the era, Harr &amp;amp; Harry uses a text parser for player input (there is a list of all the recognized words in the game manual). While george's first goal is to escape his prison, he soon finds out this is more than a random kidnapping; it has something to do with the Box of Rajmahal, a 2000 years object rumored to hold the secrets of Existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game in progress can't be saved, but once the player finishes a chapter (there are three in this game), he's given a code to unlock the next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
