			<description>Shako which means Chess in Esperanto, is a chess variant played on a 10X10 board. This variant uses all the rules of orthodox chess, and the way the pieces are placed in the opening setup, again in the familiar pattern, allow players to follow practical all the openings used for orthodox chess. The new pieces are taken from Xiangqi (Chinese Chess).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elephants are added on the outside of the rooks. Elephants move one or two squares diagonally. When an elephant moves two squares, it is allowed to jump.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;the two ranks of pieces are moved up, so sit as they would on an 8X8 board. the rank closest to the player is empty except for two cannons on the outer most squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cannons move without taking like rooks, and they move with taking by going in a straight horizontal and vertical line and jumping over exactly one piece: when a cannon takes a piece, there must be exactly one piece between the original and final square of the cannons move - this piece may be of either color. (This is identical to the move of the cannon in Xiangqi.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other pieces move as normal. Win is by checkmate&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
