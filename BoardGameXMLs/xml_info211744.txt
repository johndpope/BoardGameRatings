			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The merc team are transporting a large stash of a variety of military goods to a remote outpost in the middle of a warzone. Some of those goods aren't quite kosher, as well. But it's all in a day's work for a mercenary company. To carry all those goods at once, the mercs have stripped their copter of a lot of their usual equipment. But they're well behind the battle lines, so it's not really a worry. Only, a hired hit squad has been dogging the mercs from a distance for a while now, waiting for a good chance to strike. Which just got handed to them on a silver platter...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
