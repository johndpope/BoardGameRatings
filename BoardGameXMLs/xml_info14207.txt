							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Murderless Mysteries: Master Sleuth Convention</name>
									
			<description>This is a mystery party game, but NOT a murder mystery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Latest in a series called &amp;quot;Murderless Mysteries&amp;quot;, that claim the following difference from other mystery party games:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;There is no murder, the crime to be solved is non-violent.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;An unlimited number of party guests can participate.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;The same game can be played again with a different solution.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;No one, including the host and even the culprit, can ever be sure of who dunnit, until it is revealed at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 6 main characters who are encouraged to dress in costume, plus a game leader. But other guests at the party can ask questions and vote on who they think did it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six main characters in this story are famous fictional sleuths hoping to win the Master Sleuth award.  But the award has been stolen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who took it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sherlock Chan: This odd fellow is a combination of Sherlock Holmes and Charlie Chan. Has an air of intelligence, superiority, preferably someone who can do a Chinese accent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspector Hercules Klutzeau: This Frenchman (Belgian!) is a combination of Hercules Poirot and Inspector Clouseau. A silly, life-of-the-party type person, clumsy and has a funny French accent, mispronouncing words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nancy Trew: This woman is a combination of Nancy Drew and Wonder Woman. A young woman who uses teenager jargon and giggles, but comes on strong when she switches to her alter-ego.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hata Mari: This vamp is a combination of Mata Hari and women spies in James Bond movies. Outgoing, sexy and flirtatious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Miss Marbles: This old lady is a combination of Jessica Fletcher (Murder She Wrote) and Miss Marples. A very old, senile lady.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Squintzy: This fellow is a combination of TV characters Quincy and Mark Sloan (Diagnosis Murder). Wild and crazy, with a good loud dirty laugh. Has a German or Russian accent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents of the game include:&lt;br/&gt; Host guidelines, preparations, prop suggestions&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; Host script (1)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; Host (MC) facts sheets (2)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; Anonymous tip note (20 copies)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; Audience ballots (20)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; Nominee instructions (6)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; Clue sheets (2 sets of 6)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; Sleuth certificates (5)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; Master Sleuth Award certificate (1)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; Fortune (as from cookie) (1)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; Bubble gum wrapper (1)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; Gold rope (1)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
