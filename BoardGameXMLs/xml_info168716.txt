							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Famous Moral Dilemmas of History</name>
									
			<description>An expansion or booster pack for Moral Dilemma which includes 25 additional moral dilemma cards that can be mixed into the full game or played separately. So you and your friends can debate such historical factoids, like:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Did you know that the Nazis were the first to realize that smoking led to lung cancer and started the first anti-smoking campaign? True story.&lt;br/&gt;Do you:&lt;br/&gt;a) feel like a bit of a Nazi if you are against smoking?&lt;br/&gt;b) feel cool for copying the Nazis?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
