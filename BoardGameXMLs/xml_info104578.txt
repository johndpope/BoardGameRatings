			<description>Russian bluffing game using standard deck of cards, similar to Cheat; the main difference is that the called rank stays the same during a round, rather than changing from player to player, forcing people to start bluffing almost immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play with a full deck for 4+ players, thin the deck to 36 cards (remove 2s through 5s) for fewer players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is for a player to get rid of all cards they have. Start by removing one random card from the deck (so that there is one rank that cannot form four-of-a-kind) and deal the remaining deck out between the players. On their turn, a player must discard 1-3 cards face down and announce those cards' rank (the same rank being called for the entire round, and players may lie about what they are discarding), or call the bluff of the previous player.  When a bluff is called, the played cards are revealed and the loser of the challenge draws the entire discard pile without showing the cards to anyone. After drawing the discard pile, a player may choose to discard sets of four-of-a-kind from their hand (in some versions of the game all must be discarded; in others, only a single set). The player to the left of the challenge loser starts the next round, naming a rank of their choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
