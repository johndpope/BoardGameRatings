			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Derelict, 3-8 players are exploring an abandoned space ship. What is the purpose of the ship, and the rooms that the crew discover along the way? That is yet to be discovered. But with a bit of knowledge and some luck, you may be able to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Derelict is a tile exploration, worker placement board game for 3-8 players. Players work together to explore the derelict ship and gain resources along the way. At some point in the game, the purpose of the ship becomes clear. At that point, it is everyone for themselves as they try to escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With dozens of scenarios, Derelict can be played again and again, and each time will be different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
