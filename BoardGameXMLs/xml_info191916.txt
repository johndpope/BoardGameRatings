			<description>A fast-paced abstract dice game for two players where no die is thrown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this game is referred as board game, no board is needed. Just a bit of flat surface and set of distinguishable 6-sided dice, six for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of both players is to put dice on the surface, create a single formation from them and either block an enemy to be unable to perform any of valid actions, or be the first player available to merge the dice whose value is more than 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning, both players put one die with one dot upwards on the playing surface in a way that both dice touch each other by a side. Then during each turn a player can perform one of the following actions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Add a die into game - newly added die cannot touch any of the opponents' dice,&lt;br/&gt;2. Move the die around the existing formation - die moves around the perimeter of the remaining dice on surface,&lt;br/&gt;3. Merge the dice - player removes one die of his own and promotes an adjacent dice by value of the removed one. &lt;br/&gt;   a) There must be at least 3 dice of yours in play to do this!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player must keep in mind that every die on surface has to be adjacent to at least one another die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a situation occurs that player on turn can merge dice whose value is larger than 6, he becomes a winner.&lt;br/&gt;A player also wins, if his opponent on turn cannot perform any of the actions mentioned above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
