			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PC&amp;rsquo;s, on the whole, can be an unpredictable lot, suddenly going off in completely the opposite direction to that which you (the DM) had planned, or insisting on visiting a possible adventure area that appears on their campaign map - but which you have not designed yet. This is where a &amp;lsquo;side-track&amp;rsquo; adventure may be able to help. The basic idea behind these &amp;lsquo;mini-adventure&amp;rsquo; supplements is that, while they can be used a small adventures on their own, they can also be &amp;lsquo;inserted&amp;rsquo; into an existing adventure or campaign as an extra area for your players to explore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each &amp;lsquo;side-track&amp;rsquo; adventure therefore concentrates solely on the &amp;lsquo;dungeon&amp;rsquo; aspect of the encounter(s), and contains full colour floor-plans for use with your 25-30mm miniatures (if you so desire). Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t use miniatures, using the floorplans to show the layout of the dungeon is a great time saver (rather than having to quote the exact room dimensions for the party&amp;rsquo;s mapper all the time).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With any luck, these &amp;lsquo;side-track&amp;rsquo; adventures may help you create a more believable world for your players to explore - after all, it&amp;rsquo;s always a good idea to have a back-up dungeon or two up your sleeve for those times when your players seem to ignore every hint you throw at them and go off at a complete tangent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
