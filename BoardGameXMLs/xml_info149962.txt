							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Steppenwolf</name>
									
			<description>designer's comment:&lt;br/&gt;This was sort of a whim I cooked up a few years ago, loosely inspired by Hermann Hesse's novel of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Steppenwolf is a game about one man. This man will be portrayed by two players &amp;ndash; one called the Traveler, and the other the Road. The Traveler will generally be responsible for the man&amp;rsquo;s actions and interests, while the Road will help determine the man&amp;rsquo;s adversity and environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Together, they will craft a story that concerns a pivotal moment in the man&amp;rsquo;s life. This could involve accomplishing a great feat, finding an answer to a difficult question, some form of self-discovery, etc. It is certain that the man will succeed in his quest; what is uncertain is how he will arrive, and what it will cost him along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
