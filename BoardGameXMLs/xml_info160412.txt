			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following is an extract from The Report of The 25th Bi-Annual Symposium on Dental Hygiene: THE DK MENACE. It has long been known that our teeth are under constant attack form a form of oral bacteria known as Dentorium Kamikazium: The DK. Little has been known about the life cycle of the DK but the recent research has revealed a startling fact. Bacteriologists believe that the DK's life span was limited because the mechanism by which it attacked teeth led to its own destruction (see 'The Kamikazi Effect', Shimoto 1973.) What Shimoto did not realise however was that the DK's destruction was not permanent. It is able to rejuvenate after each attack upon a small tooth and this, far from having a short life is in fact immortal! This discovery has led inevitably to a radical change in our attitudes to tooth decay. No longer are we able to believe that decay can be eradicated completely. The indestructability of the DK means that we can only hope to reduce it by constant use of the toothbrush and toothpaste. On a happier note, the research has led to the development of DKX 11. This chemical has the effect of interrupting the normal DK cycle, thereby forcing it to rejuvenate early. When introduced into toothpaste, DKX 11 can extend the life of a tooth by as much as 90%. Those are the facts. This is the challenge. You have an limitless supply of Magico toothpaste (containing DKX 11) and three toothbrushes with which to prevent the DK's from destroying your teeth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Molar Maul is a bizarre game, where the player controls a toothbrush charged with keeping a mouth clean in the face of an onslaught of bacteria. The player must man&amp;oelig;uvre the toothbrush to a tube, which will deposit some toothpaste. The teeth are initially yellow (presumably indicating normal dirt), but when attacked by the bacteria, they change colour through light and dark blue, to finally black when the tooth has completely decayed. An undecayed tooth can be brought back to white by brushing the tooth. Using ten squirts of toothpaste completes the level and the player moves on to a more dangerous set of bacteria. The player's toothbrush is not vulnerable to the bacteria, but losing 4 teeth to decay means that one of the three toothbrushes is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By John Gibson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
