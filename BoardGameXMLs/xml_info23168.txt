							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rara kruiswoordspel</name>
									
			<description>The Rara Kruiswoordspel is a close relative of Scrabble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box contains a gameboard and a set of plastic tiles.&lt;br/&gt;Each tile shows one letter of the alphabet. There are also a few joker tiles. The number of tiles showing a letter is related to the frequency of that letter in Dutch text.&lt;br/&gt;The board has a grid of 15 by 19 squares. A square can hold one letter tile. Some squares are black. These are like black squares in a crossword puzzle: you can't put a letter there. Other squares carry the number 10 or 20. Those are bonus squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have a hand of 10 randomly drawn letter tiles. On their turn they can lay down up to 7 of those on the board. The rules for playing the tiles are the same as in Scrabble. The score is one point per letter in each word created or altered, plus the value of any bonus squares covered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
