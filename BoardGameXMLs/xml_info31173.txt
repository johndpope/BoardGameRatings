							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Teachers Game</name>
									
			<description>The teachers game consists of four different, all slightly silly, but entertaining games, based around school room subjects.  The aim of the game is to score more points on your School Report Card than any other pupil.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;English questions involve completing a phrase using an adjective beginning with a particular letter without repeating a word already used or hesitating for more than 10 seconds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geography questions involve naming a country, town, river, or state that begins with the last letter of the name of the country on the question card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maths questions involve arriving at a given number using four other numbers also given and multiplying, adding, subtracting, or dividing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Art questions involve choosing a word from a card and communicating the word by drawing on a pad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
