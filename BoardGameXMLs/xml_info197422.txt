							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Serpent in the Staglands</name>
									
			<description>Serpent in the Staglands is a campaign within the world of Vol, a fully realized setting inspired by the late bronze age in a Transylvanian landscape, with unique politics, races and gods steeped in history. Featuring a chosen party of five, you take the role of Necholai, a minor god of a celestial body, who descends to the Staglands for a moonlit festival only to find his way home blocked and immortality slipping out of his grasp. Seeking answers and aid, he takes on a mortal body and the guise of a traveling Spicer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game rolls the dice for you, you'll traverse the Staglands on a path narrated by your own wits and choices. A true role-playing experience, Serpent in the Staglands doesn't hinder your adventure with auto-populating map markers, checklist quest grinding or rigid story exposition. You'll put the pieces of the puzzle together, and with different ending scenarios and closed off areas of the game based off actions, you'll want to play it more than once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use your own wits to examine maps, decipher languages, decode runes and figure out how to kill the unkillable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
