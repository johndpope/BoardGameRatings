			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Mortiston, USA is a zombie apocalypse campaign setting book licensed for use with Outbreak: Undead, Savage Worlds and OGL Modern.  The book details the events of a mysterious apocalypse that suddenly arises in a medium-sized American town.  Cut off from the outside world in a mountain valley town 50 miles in any direction from other civilization, the surviving citizens of Mortiston barricade themselves into their homes.  Some of them even make it through the night.  Factions form as survivors come together, escape from the valley becomes impossible and survival becomes critical as resources begin to dwindle in the world after Z-Day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Mortiston, USA is an 76 page campaign setting and resource guidebook for use with nearly any modern apocalypse role-playing game.  The guidebook contains 20 detailed npc survivors with their motivations, desires, equipment and stats in all three systems (Outbreak: Undead, Savage Worlds and Rotworld).  It also contains 30 detailed locations with backgrounds, descriptions and equipment.  Additionally it contains a timeline and other materials covering the events of Z-Day and roughly the first 200 days after Z-Day.  The book takes into account dwindling resources and dying survivors over the time period so that the GM could, for example, know how much gasoline is likely to remain in a given gas station on Z-Day+75.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Mortiston, USA is being published in both softcover book and pdf by Scrying Eye Games for release at Origins 2012 (May/June).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
