							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Maestro Base Class</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll Over, Beethoven!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prototype of the modern day rockstar, the maestro is a musical genius whose works entertain the masses and make the dull drudgery that is the life of the peasant a little more livable. While usually a man of the people, some maestros are patronized by established power, such as nobles and certain religions seeking new compositions. Still others look to the adventuring profession for the inspiration they need to produce that next great masterpiece. Regardless of their source of income, maestros are often eccentric and almost always possessed of an incredible ego, making their kind an excellent topic for gossip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The latest in Interjection Games' growing library of base classes, The Maestro Base Class offers up a fairly simple gameplay concept, which is this: what would happen if a bard could compose and perform his own custom performances? Featuring nearly 70 compositions that can be mixed and matched in a number of musical scores, the maestro plays less like a jack-of-all-trades and more like a mystic theurge that just so happens to have music as one of its two sources of power. Wagner, Beethoven, Mozart, Strauss, and more are represented in various Opuses, canned compositions of enormous power that can cause cannonballs to rain down on the battlefield, make an ally a juggernaut temporarily, and even raise the dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those looking to make music and the creative process the defining concepts for their character, this is the class for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product includes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Maestro Base Class&lt;br/&gt;     A spell list that combines the luck-fixing powers of the oracle and the musical mastery of the bard&lt;br/&gt;     The Composition Book, containing 28 intros and outros and 40 melodies&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for scribing folios of compositions for use by others&lt;br/&gt;     6 Feats&lt;br/&gt;     13 Opuses&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
