			<description>A One-Round Living City Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of you received a vague note from a gypsy singer regarding a meeting this evening at the Silk Shop of Madam Coth. The shop is in the middle of the merchant square and was very well known before the start of the war. Many of the city&amp;rsquo;s finest dressed swore by the remarkable wares sold by Madam Coth. Tonight the area is in disarray, and the wails of the hungry seem to be surrounding you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Madam Coth is known to be a gypsy from a far off land. She has never before requested the assistance of the adventuring community but her note came at an opportune moment, as there has been a lull in the fighting for almost two rides. Arriving at her shop you find she has requested many of your fellow adventurers to meet with her this clear evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
