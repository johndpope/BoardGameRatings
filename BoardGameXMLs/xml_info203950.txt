							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Net Book of Poisons</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The document originally was published as Poisons of the Realm.  Under that title, two versions were made available - a two-part ASCII version and a (later) combined DOC version.  The book was then substantively revised with roughly twice as much content.  This revised version was published as The Net Book of Poisons in DOC format, and was a &amp;quot;correction, expansion, and overall revamping&amp;quot; of the initial version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initial version had obvious ties to The Forgotten Realms - these ties were carried over into the revised version but were not emphasized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
