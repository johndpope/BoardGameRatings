			<description>12th and final of 12 games in the Epoch Wargame Electronics series. Each of the games features easy to learn rules (in Japanese), quick games that average about 30 minutes (not including setup), magnetic pieces on a set board, and an electronic dice-roller with 6 LED dots to work out the effects of combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As long as one player knows the rules, the other player does not need to know any Japanese in order to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular entry in the series centers around infantry and tank combat in the desert during World War 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
