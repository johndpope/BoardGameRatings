			<description>An abstract strategy game played on an octagonal board (10x10 squares with corners removed). The object of the game is to capture the opponent's four Vital Element pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with four different Vital Element pieces (circle, triangle, rectangle, square) on their back rank and six identical Warrior pieces on their second rank. On their turn each player moves one of their Warriors one square, or one of their Vital Elements up to two squares. They can capture an opposing piece by landing on its square, although a Vital Element cannot capture an opposing Vital Element unless it is the same shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player captures a Vital Element they may make a special bonus move, such as teleporting a piece across the board or resurrecting a captured Warrior, according to what shape of Element was captured. If a player captures all four opposing Vital Elements they win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
