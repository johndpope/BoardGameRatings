			<description>Automotive Annihilation is a car racing and combat game; the core mechanics are rolling five custom dice, moving around a board, and playing weapon cards. It has several unique features that separate it from similar themed games including a lane changing mechanic where you cannot pass cars that are in your lane. The dice rolling is similar to King of Tokyo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Automotive Annihilation will appeal greatly to hardcore gamers while being accessible and easy to learn and play for almost anybody&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
