			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many villains are always in the news; many are always on our minds. Some however, have not been seen for years and to some this means that they are retired, in jail or dead. Only if this was in fact the truth of the matter, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many villains have gone into hiding while others are simply enjoying the fruits of their labor. Some are sitting on a secluded beach getting a tan or perhaps amusing themselves in a casino or nightclub in a friendly country. Still others are upgrading their tech or learning some new ricks to use on heroes and law enforcement. The truth is that all villains aren&amp;rsquo;t created or driven in the same way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here you will find villains of old back from their self induced hiatus and ready to pounce on the world again. Villains from some of Hero Games older material that have yet to be upgraded to 6th edition. Some of your favorite or perhaps &amp;ldquo;lightly&amp;rdquo; use villains perfect to inject into a new Champions campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this installment 6th edition stats for Griffin, Halfjack and Hideous will be given including Hero Designer files &amp;amp; printable cardboard miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
