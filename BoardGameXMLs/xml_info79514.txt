			<description>Players take turns rolling 1-6 dice. Beginning with a 1, all consecutive dice (i.e. 1,2,3 etc) are stacked up in the middle. After 6, the 1 is stacked on top. Dice which can't be used have to be taken back. If the stack topples, the guilty player has to take all the dice. The first player to run out of dice is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was sold in a dice bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
