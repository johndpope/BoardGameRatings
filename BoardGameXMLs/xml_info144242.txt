			<description>A jig-saw puzzle game which can be played in four different ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic play: Each player gets a one of four different color/picture puzzle frames and a box of 36 numbered puzzle pieces of the same color. Then there is a die/dice/chit pull and the players take/loose pieces depending on version played. This continues till a player completes a puzzle and yells Eureko!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four ways to play are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Color Eureko! - roll color die (d6 yellow, brown, green, blue, yellow/blue, green/brown) and number die (d6 1, 2, 3, 4, -1, -2), get/loose that many pieces of the color(s) rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  Number Eureko! - Put your color puzzle pieces number side up (pieces are numbered from 1-72, not all numbers are in each puzzle), a number disc is drawn and any one with that number gets that piece, if the number was red players with that number also get a credit chit, chit may be turned in for more pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.  Picture Eureko! - each player rolls the number die and gets/looses that many pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.  Solitaire Eureko! - play however you want or just put the puzzles together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
