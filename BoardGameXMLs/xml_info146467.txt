							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Swordquest (Revised Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will command a force of Leaders, Guards and Magic-Users in his search for the Lost Sword of Lumina. As players maneuver over the full color map, they will encounter monsters, enemies, spells and a Dragon that can be controlled; but will often turn on the controller! A unique tactical combat system will allow players to take on a much larger force with a good chance of winning. It is not difficult for a player to discover a sword, but once found it must be taken to a citadel, and even then it may be counterfeit!&lt;br/&gt;     In this new revised edition, each character is given his own individual abilities. Also included in the edition is a Random Events Table, which can drastically change a players strategy. Also included is a new map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
