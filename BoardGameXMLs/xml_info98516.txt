							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Combat Lynx</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, the player operates a Westland Lynx helicopter. Although the Lynx is primarily used as troop transporter and Anti-Submarine Warfare, there are battlefield editions. In this game however, the Combat Lynx uses an enormous array of modern weapons, ranging from several types of guided and unguided rockets, to minefield laying capability and Sidewinder A-A rockets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the player flies for an unnamed country with a few helicopter bases. This land is invaded. Tanks and other enemy units slowly make their way towards the bases and when adjacent long enough, will inflict casualties on the personnel ann eventually overrun the base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can prevent this. At start, by laying minefields around the bases. Then, by actively engaging the enemy, using the modern weaponry. And lastly, new personnel can be flown to relieved bases and injured servicemen evacuated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the bases are pretty far out and there are numerous enemies, it is hard to keep all the bases fully staffed and in own possession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time the helicopter touches down on the principle airbase, the player gets the option to load out his chopper, with air to ground weapons, air to air weapons, mines and personnel. The lifting/ loading capacity limits what can be taken. After the loadout screen, the view switches to 3rd person, and the player can take off and perform the actions he deems most necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although one would be hard pressed to call this game a realistic simulator, it has far too many options, buttons and possibilities to be called arcade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
