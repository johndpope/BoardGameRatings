							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Piat Gin</name>
									
			<description>Piat Gin is a card drafting game with Rummy-like scoring at the end. Players are dealt 6 cards. They keep one, placing face-down in front of them, and then pass two from their hand face-up to the player on their left. This is repeated, keeping one passing two, until they only have three cards left in their hand. During this last hand (you'll have three cards) you'll keep one and only pass one. Once finished players will keep both of these cards to finish their set of cards. All players reveal their hands and begin scoring. The highest scoring hand wins and receives bonus points. Play to a set score, usually 100 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Piat Gin is the next game in the series of &amp;quot;alien card games&amp;quot;, Konog being the first. Games designed around the premise of a fictional alien race and how they might go about making a game that reflects their culture, biology, ideologies and other aspects of the species. These games are imported and introduced to those of us living in the Core Systems by the explorers and pioneers returning from the frontiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Camenni are a long-lived species, known for extreme patience and sudden bursts of well-coordinated action. Piat Gin is a simple past time, different from the more complex time-consuming games that the elders might take part in (games similar to Chess or Go in which single turns can take years or decades to accomplish). This is not a game that possesses lavish details or ornate components. Piat Gin is carried by Camenni adventurers due to its small size or used to teach children patience and to practice the observation of subtle interactions of others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card faces and their features are intentionally kept simple, possessing no complex Camenni script, only differing amounts of circles, triangles, or rhombus (3 suits, numbered 1-6). This is so the game can be taught to most any species that might be encountered (please note that this deck is not resistant to mucus, salivation, persperation, or extremely high body temperatures like standard &amp;quot;outrider&amp;quot; decks). Camenni will drag a game of Piat Gin on for hours and even days when playing with each other. Of course, we don't have that luxury and play a round in a few minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
