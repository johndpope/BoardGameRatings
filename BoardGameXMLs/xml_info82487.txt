			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Run Baby Run was a maze chase game released for the ZX Spectrum in 1983. It was programmed by Tony Rainbird of Micro Gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes the role of a getaway driver who is trying to shake the cops on his tail... The cops follow exactly the route that the player takes, and the aim is to get them to collide with each other. Once all the chasing cops have been eliminated, the player must avoid a final gun car and make his getaway off the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a number of different levels, which then repeat with the action getting faster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
