			<description>- Blurb from Goodman Games website -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a spaceship 50 miles long with more than a million colonists, Epsilon City was the single largest habitation. It was filled with entertainment centers, apartments, and offices for all the people moving about the ship during the long voyage. The city was designed to be maintained by its own artificial intelligence (A.I.) and a special series of robots able to maintain areas of the city when breakdowns happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Epsilon City wasn&amp;rsquo;t even half full when the interstellar radiation cloud destroyed the people of the ship and turned 99% of them into piles of white ash. The city was wiped out. Now, three hundred years later, things are vastly different in the city. The A.I. is insane and has an aggressive personality. The special robots have had to change or be destroyed, and have mutated much like the rest of the life on the ship. Wolfoid packs now inhabit many sections of the city and consider this metropolis their lair. And many more dangers lurk, hidden and waiting to be explored&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2016 marks the 40th anniversary of Metamorphosis Alpha! In honor of this milestone, creator James M. Ward has authorized Goodman Games to publish Metamorphosis Alpha: Epsilon City. This huge expansion for the starship Warden is the biggest expansion for the original 1976 edition ever published!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This box contains: The 272-page spiral-bound hardcover Epsilon City setting book, three 11&amp;rdquo;x17&amp;rdquo; maps, a 20-page cyborg supplement, and a 56-page adventure supplement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by James M. Ward, and Jobe Bittman, Michael Curtis, Jon Hook, and Jim Wampler&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rear Cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Derelict City on a Colony Ship Hurtling Through Space!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a spaceship 50 miles long with more than a million colonists, Epsilon City was the single largest habitation.
