			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RPG - Rage Precognition Grace is a one-page RPG.  Characters have three Aspects (Rage, Precognition, and Grace), with values between 0 and 3.  Characters also have a number of derived Attributes including Wounds (e.g., hit points) which start at 8; unconsciousness occurs at 0 Wounds and death occurs at -10 Wounds).  Characters can use Black Magic (damaging magic) and White Magic (healing magic) once they have found and read a Magic Tome that teaches them how to do it.  Characters begin play with an Equipment Package based on Class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action checks, known as Tests, use 2d6 plus the appropriate Aspect, with values of eight or higher indicating success (&amp;quot;snake eyes&amp;quot; always fail).  Combat supports initiative and characters may perform an attack, move/attack, or move/move action.  Melee attacks are based on Rage and missile attacks are based on Grace; spell casting is based on Precognition.  Several magic Elixers raise character Aspects when imbibed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
