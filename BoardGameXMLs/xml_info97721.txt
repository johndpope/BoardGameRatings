			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free Falcon is a community build freeware simulation of primarily the F-16 Fighting Falcon, though a number of other jets can be flown. It's one of the most realistic flight sims available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dec'99 Hasbro Interactive ceased Microprose and thus the development of Falcon 4.0 (patch 1.08) and a year later Hasbro also took down the official Falcon 4 website. In April 2000 the source code of Falcon was leaked to the general public and the community picked up where Microprose stopped. Several patches, flyable planes and new campaigns were added. Eventually this led to the release of FreeFalcon 1 on April 25th, 2003.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;April 2011 version Free Falcon 5.5.5 was released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FreeFalcon now runs under WinXP, Vista and Win7 and there still is an active support through the community forum. Bugs are noted and patches still released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the freeware install some 26 different planes, mostly jets, are flyable. 24 of them with a 3D cockpit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also includes a dynamic campain set in Korea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the free DownLoadable Content, there are also small companies selling additional 3D cockpits, jet skins and other DLC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
