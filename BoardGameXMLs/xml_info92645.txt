			<description>Agatha Christie's The A.B.C. Murders has players control Captain Hastings and must solve the mystery by inspecting crime scenes and questioning suspects. In order to appeal to players familiar with the original story, the game also offers the option to play with a different murderer, which results in different clues and testimony throughout the entire game. The game received mediocre reviews, but was commended for its faithful recreation of the source material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The A.B.C. Murders&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this DS game, the player searches for a murderer, asking questions of eyewitnesses and answering riddles.  Word answers are written using the DS touchscreen which appears as an old fashioned notepad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
