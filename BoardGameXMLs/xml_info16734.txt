In a small, isolated village inside a forest in deepest, darkest Transylvania stands a small medieval tavern where our story begins. It&amp;rsquo;s through an encounter here that you and other like-minded travelers of fortune manage to get jobs at the castle on the hill belonging to Count Dracenstein. But soon, things start to get a little strange and you and your fellow workers are exposed to a host of horrifying situations. You realize, perhaps too late, the true intentions of the Count and soon discover the real secret of..THE BLOOD OF DRACENSTEINS&amp;rsquo; CASTLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are the Workers. They will act out SEVEN SCENES, working from instructions given by the DIRECTOR (on the audio CD). They arrive on set 'in character', each with their own secret identity (sealed instructions sent out by the host(s) with the invitations). The evening culminates in THE SCREEN PLAY AWARD CEREMONY a magnificent affair where players are judged in three categories; On their abilities to ACT, to IDENTIFY CHARACTER TRAITS IN OTHERS and to DISCOVER THE SECRET.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner will keep the prestigious SCREEN PLAY AWARD STATUE.  &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brief Notes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of a series of &amp;quot;Movie Mystery&amp;quot; games, which work well at parties with people who enjoy mysteries and a little bit of play-acting.  Role-playing gamers can easily take to this as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
