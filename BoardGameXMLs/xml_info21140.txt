			<description>This game consists of a deck of 36 square cards representing star systems and constellations. It is not only a game, but it may constitute an help for the realization of theatrical or narrative structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take three cards each an try to form a particular configuration before the other players. When such a configuration is done, the player says &amp;quot;TRIS&amp;quot; and puts the cards in his score stack. Another hand is dealt and so on, until the cards are over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scoring differs in the three version of the game (Base, Medium and Difficult). In the base games it is simply the number of cards captured, while in the other versions also the numbers on the cards are taken into account.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
