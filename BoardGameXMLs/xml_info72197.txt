							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Schleichfahrt: Sneaking Behind Enemy Lines</name>
									
			<description>In the not so distant future, mankind has managed to lay waste to earth's surface. Even though forced to find a new home on the ocean ground, nothing stopped humans to continue battling each other.&lt;br/&gt;You are a mercenary trying to make his living by serving those that pay most.&lt;br/&gt;Your mission sounds easy at first glance:&lt;br/&gt;Scout the ocean ground for three different resources and bring them back to the hangar, so the technicans can build a bomb you are to drop over the enemy base.&lt;br/&gt;Here comes the downside: You are all on your own between the beasts of the deep sea as well as the very well armed hostile submarines.&lt;br/&gt;And the resources to equip your sub are limited!&lt;br/&gt;Good luck, mercenary - we count on you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Schleichfahrt - sneaking behind enemy lines has been created during the Sneaky Sci Fi Game Contest in May/June 2010 held by Rudolf Aligierski. &lt;br/&gt;It is a solitaire ocean crawl in which you are playing a mercenary in his sub on his mission to gather resources and - upon having done so - to deploy a bomb on the hostile base.&lt;br/&gt;While you will encounter monsters of the deep sea as well as loads of hostile subs, fighting is not always an option. Most of the time you will be better off relying on your engines to maneuver you out of sight of the enemy subs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
