							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sorcerer of Siva</name>
									
			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amulets, rings, necklaces, scepters,--oh, yes, and a pair of old boots--await you in the magical mines of Siva. Magic and riches abound. But wealth is not all you seek.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only entrance seals behind you as you enter the dark stillness of the mine. Armed with only a dagger and your magical abilities, you have but a few short hours to seek out the secret exit (hidden somewhere on the fifth level) before you are sealed in for all time. But beware the wandering soulless creatures that dwell in the more than 300 chambers of the magical mine, guarding every treasure and lurking beneath every trap door.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wizard you are, yes, who can hurl a fireball or lightning bolt to slay the blood-thirsty banshee; put an end to the deadly demon, or goad the goblin waiting to waylay you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your spells can create openings in solid walls and sealed entrances, heal your wounds, restore your strength, or give you the gift of weightlessness which lets you move effortlessly from room to room. Your own bravery will decide how many spells you shall bring into the mines. But beware the evil Sorcerer, who is waiting to cast his favorite spell--forgetfulness--to deprive you of your most valuable magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But all is not lost... You may regain a spell or two or, perhaps, if you can discover the wondrous touchstones no archaeologist has yet found--stones with powers to increase your magical abilities. Though, expect not that these, or others, always lie still, for the Sorcerer and his minions are afoot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be warned, too, that not all treasures you might find are true. Mysterious items might drain your life's blood and leave you in blackness. Will a ring bring you only wealth? Can a pair of old boots do more than protect your soleful feet? In experience lies wisdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Graphics! Computer generated map. (Apple and Atari use color and sound.)&lt;br/&gt;     Real time.&lt;br/&gt;     You play the role of a spell-wielding wizard in magical combat.&lt;br/&gt;     For ages 10 through adult.&lt;br/&gt;     Complexity: Intermediate.&lt;br/&gt;     Playing time: 30 minutes to hours of fun.&lt;br/&gt;     For one player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
