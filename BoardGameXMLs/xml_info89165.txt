							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Clay &#039;n&#039; Rain</name>
									
			<description>In a world made of clay, only one person stands between the sky, the flowers and total mayhem. The plants and flowers of Clay World need rain to survive, and only you can bring it to them. Using the power of your iPhone&amp;rsquo;s tilt mechanism, guide thousands of clay raindrops onto hundreds of clay flowers over dozens of clay levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The innovate gameplay of Clay n&amp;rsquo; Rain makes full use of your iPhone&amp;rsquo;s tilt mechanism to deliver relaxing gameplay into the palm of your hand. Raindrops, even clay ones, are simple little things and can&amp;rsquo;t always find their way to the ground when there are lots of obstacles in the way. So it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to help guide them on their way from sky to flower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Original graphics and a colourful cuteness that will put a smile on the faces of players of all ages, and all exclusively for your iPhone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Game assets completely made of clay,&lt;br/&gt;     100 kg of clay used to create the game!,&lt;br/&gt;     44 unique levels, 4 unique worlds (Village, Forest, Castle, Royal gardens),&lt;br/&gt;     Innovative gameplay,&lt;br/&gt;     Two gameplay modes (Casual, Hardcore)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
