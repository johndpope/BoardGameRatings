							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Feystone Shards</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Feystone Shards is an adventure for characters from levels 5-8, optimized for 4-6 player characters. This moderate length campaign should have 20+ hours of gaming, all focused around the Forgotten realms area of Red Larch. The Heroes are tasked to find five fragments of a shattered Orb, once worshipped by a faction of Elves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The search will take the party to a haunted Citadel, as they seek the scattered remnants of the Feystone. From a city of Stone Golems, to an alchemist's underground lair - the players will face obstacles and enemies that will challenge their very resolve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Heroes will need to discover the secrets of the bauble's fey magic, finding the lost Elvin city where the Orb was once worshipped as a God. Join in the hunt for the Feystone Shards, and see if your characters are ready to transcend common Heroes...and become Legends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
