			<description>World War 1 Australian war game for 2 players from the National Game Company. The object of the game is for each player to strategically place 9 howitzers playing pieces in a position along a World war 1 trench line to capture their opponents howitzers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When 3 howitzers are in aligned along the trench line the player calls out &amp;quot;Trio&amp;quot; and may remove any opponents howitzers. Failure to make this call forfeits the opportunity of a capture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns in moving howitzers around the trenches to align their howitzer guns. If a player places a howitzer in a position where trenches meet thus completing a trio in two directions he may call &amp;quot;Terror&amp;quot; and either captures an opponents piece or replace a gun previously lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over when a player does not have enough howitzers to form a trio and he has lost the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
