			<description>You are John, a private in the service of the Federation who doesn&amp;rsquo;t fight to rack up kills or for honour and pride, he just fights to survive and get the whole thing over with. His ship is controlled by Ellie, an Artificial Intelligence which is programmed to help pilots stay mentally strong throughout the war and which can not kill human beings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Inter Galactic Corporation (also known as the Federation) which controls almost the entire galaxy is fighting the Rebels, who try to free themselves from its influence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Federation is about to turn the tide of the war but then things start to go wrong. Mothership is destroyed and Ellie puts John into hibernation for 1000 years. Now he will have to discover what really happened and maybe, but just maybe, save the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
