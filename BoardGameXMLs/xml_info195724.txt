							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War of the Races</name>
									
			<description>War of the Races is a fast-paced card game that is fun, easy to learn and extremely strategic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5 armies - Orcs, Humans, Elves, Dwarves and Demons - fight for supremacy in the ancient kingdom of Erathmor. Command your armies, send out troops, utilize heroes, sorcerers and more to eliminate opposing armies and leave your mark in history with the War of the Races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each race is sold as a separate deck of cards, each with unique abilities and advantages. Players send out infantry to attack opposing armies or the King, who start with 50 and 5 health, respectively. The infantry consist of soldiers, archers, rogues, guards and fighters. These cards can be enhanced with special spells. In addition, a guard can be used to prevent that card from being easily defended against. Next, players send out their sorcerers, who utilize water, earth and fire spells to attack the opposing armies. Other players must counter with other sorcerers, creating a simple but effective 'rock, paper, scissors' effect! Lastly, heroes are sent the field, each with unique abilities, such as healing the army, reflecting any opposing attack back to the dealer, calling for reinforcements and more. Strategy cards are also used to take opposing soldiers as enemies, revive your King, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last army to remain wins the War of the Races!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
