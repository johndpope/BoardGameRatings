			<description>Daylight seeped in through the slitlike opening. The pale ray shone right into her left eye. Irritating, goading her attention. In these surroundings, singular. It shouldn't be here... A surge of adrenaline amplified by combat drugs pumped in by the medical module finally got its way. Her coming to was like a dip into a pot of boiling water. A wave of pain washed over her, lingering a mere second before the system identified the threat and provided another dose of painkillers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The haze of unconsciousness finally dispersed, leaving her in a world where the sound of alarm and red flashes of damage icons mingled into one.&lt;br/&gt;She was out for some 7 seconds. An eternity, considering the situation.&lt;br/&gt;It was a miracle she was still breathing.&lt;br/&gt;The light of day, the beam irking her pupil...&lt;br/&gt;A singular thing, an impossibility in the hermetic shell of a heavy exoskeleton.&lt;br/&gt;The realization came with a sullen smile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perforation of primary armor, bursting of the anti-shrapnel padding, directly opposite of her face at that. There was a taste of blood in her mouth, but nothing else. The biomonitor showed no major injuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She lucked out.&lt;br/&gt;15 seconds after the hit.&lt;br/&gt;Systems on-line, weapons on-line...&lt;br/&gt;Time to get back in the fight.&lt;br/&gt;The battle is far from over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lt. Bonnie &amp;quot;Ginger&amp;quot; Barlett, Heavy Exos Pilot,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Stone Commandos&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
