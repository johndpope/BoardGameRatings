			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Voidsparrow player race is a radial rethinking of what was originally a self titled D20 Modern/D20 Future Advanced Class, published by Skortched Urf Studios in late 2008. While playing with some other projects, I realized I could easily re-skin this fun, old class as a standalone, high-tech race, suitable for use with my Otherverse America, Psi-Watch and Heavy Future campaign settings. The Voidsparrows are a fine ally race for the Battlechangers or the Mantids. Like these two other player races, the Voidsparrows are a homage to one of the great action cartoons of the mid 1980s, in this case, the high flying cyborg heroes of The Silverhawks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just a warning to players and game-masters alike: with their phenomenal speed, limited FTL flight capability, and plethora of cybernetic advantages, the Voidsparrows are a powerful race. The races right at home in high power settings like Otherverse America, or fighting alongside the equally over-powered Battlechangers, but might not be at home in low powered or medieval fantasy worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
