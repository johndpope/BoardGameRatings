			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This highly idiosyncratic and unusual game utilizes character pairs that are in some ways the &amp;quot;same&amp;quot; person and in other ways two distinct people.  Each character sheet has an Agent and a Thief - the two people - and they intersect in the middle third of the sheet in a zone called the &amp;quot;mnemonic overlap&amp;quot;.  Each character in the pair has three Attributes (Intimacy, Violence, and Knowledge) with numeric ratings distributed from a standard array.  The Attribute ratings vary between the members of the character pair.  Each character in the pair also has various distinct Traits, or narrative tags.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in phases and utilizes a complicated combination of specialized cards and fairly large dice pools.  Much of the action (but certainly not all) involves the character pairs attempting to manage their shared &amp;quot;mnemonic overlap&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
