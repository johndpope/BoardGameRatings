			<description>U.S. President is Easy-Fast-Fun game with pyramids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 3 sets of pyramids you will go through last 9 weeks of presidential election campaign. With more sets you can experience more weeks and longer game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    At the beginning every player has a lead in some of swing states. (Deal cards)&lt;br/&gt;    Than players invest their funds to ads and try to convince voters in swing states. (Place one pyramid per round.)&lt;br/&gt;    Last 3 weeks of campaing are really hectic. Mood of voters changies quickly. Candidates have no time to monitor and respond to all attacks. (All players place their pyramids simultaneously.)&lt;br/&gt;    On Election Day all votes are counted, and the winner becomes the new president. (Players count electors of swing states they secured.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elementary, my dear Watson, just secure absolute majority of electors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To be a president or not to be, that is the question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modified map and State cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eleven key or swing states are marked on the modified map to send the total of 145 electors.&lt;br/&gt;Each of the eleven key states has its State card, which indicates the number of electors in the State.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Montana - 3&lt;br/&gt;    Nevada - 6&lt;br/&gt;    Iowa - 6&lt;br/&gt;    Colorado - 9&lt;br/&gt;    Wisconsin - 10&lt;br/&gt;    Virginia - 13&lt;br/&gt;    North Carolina - 15&lt;br/&gt;    Michigan - 16&lt;br/&gt;    Ohio - 18&lt;br/&gt;    Pennsylvania - 20&lt;br/&gt;    Florida - 29 (but be sure you have sufficient lead according to the rules)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Did you know that even winning in three biggest states does not mean a victory?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;US President is the winner of the Game of the year 2013 Competition (Czech fan-organized competition open for all games with pyramids).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The game is a simulation of the U.S. presidential election. &lt;br/&gt;    The object of the game is to gain an absolute majority of the electors in key or swing states.&lt;br/&gt;    There is a modified map of USA to play on and eleven State cards to play with. &lt;br/&gt;    You need at least three sets of pyramids to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was first published as a gift for all fans of pyramids in 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
