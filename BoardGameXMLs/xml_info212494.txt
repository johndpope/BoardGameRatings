			<description>When you hear the word frozen do you think of the color blue, white or grey? Is Christmas red, white, or green? How does the color you think of change if words are combined, such as frozen Christmas?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a turn as the COLORologist and draws a word card and chooses the color that they think best describes the word. How many of the other players will choose the same color for the word? Any player that matches the same color as the COLORologist moves forward one space. The first player to reach the finish space wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
