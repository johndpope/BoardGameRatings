			<description>Baby GOUGGY is unhappy for different reasons. He may want; a dressing, a toy, pacifier, milk, his ball or take a bath. Determine why his sad and give to him what he desires. Take care to your babies GOUGGY not happy!  Opponents can put down different disadvantage cards on them; booger, dirty bib, pee and even ... a big poop!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME PLAY&lt;br/&gt;Each player performs this steps in order :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Draw from the draw pile and/or the discard pile for a total of 6 cards in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;2. Place a Gouggy not happy face up in front of you to start a baby pile. Each player may have no more than 3 baby piles underway at a time.&lt;br/&gt;3. Use a subject (dressing, toy, pacifier, milk, ball or  bath) to continue your baby pile.&lt;br/&gt;4. Once you have placed the appropriate subject card on your baby pile, you can place a Gouggy happy on that pile.&lt;br/&gt;5. Place that baby pile face down in your points pile to make room for a new baby pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Slow down an opponent by placing a disadvantage (booger, dirty bib, pee or poop) over a Gouggy not happy. If another player places one of this card on one of your baby piles, you must first remove the card before you can continue building that baby pile. On your next turn, place the appropriate subject (handkerchief bib clean, powder, nose clip) to remove disadvantage. Once you have done this, place the disadvantage and the subject in your points pile.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends once the player who draws the last card from the draw pile has taken his/her turn. When the game is over, count your Gouggy happy you have in your point pile. The winner is the player with the most Gouggy happy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
