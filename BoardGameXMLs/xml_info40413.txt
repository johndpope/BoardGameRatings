							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Au Pont de Lodi</name>
									
			<description>Game description: The First Italy Campaign (1796-1797) was actually the most brilliant military expedition of the French Revolutionary Wars.The Lodi manoeuver was also, strategically thinking, a large flanking operation against Beaulieu&amp;rsquo;s army.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Au pont de Lodi&amp;rdquo; is a simulation of the May 10, 1796 battle, which opened the way to general Bonaparte&amp;rsquo;s triumph over the Austrian Lombardische Arm&amp;eacute;e, leading his Italy&amp;rsquo;s army towards the seize of Milan. The Battle of Lodi was not a decisive engagement, since the Austrian army had successfully escaped. But it became a central element in the Napoleonic myth and, according to Napoleon himself, contributed to convincing him that he was superior to other generals, and that his destiny would lead him to achieve great things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses the 'La Bataille series' rules from Clash of Arms. The Rulebook is intended to be a rough guide to tactical warfare in the last Eighteenth Century and in the beginning of the &amp;ldquo;age of Napoleon&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: The series rules are not included in the game. Rules from any La Bataille game can be used or they must be downloaded. Both the full rules and the simple Marie Louise rules can be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
