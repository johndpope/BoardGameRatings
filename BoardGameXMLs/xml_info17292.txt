			<description>Limbo - How Low Can You Go?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;5 Limbo Blocks (wooden blocks (5cm x 5cm x 13cm)&lt;br/&gt;1 Limbo Bar (wooden block (0.5cm x 5cm x 13cm) with Velcro pad&lt;br/&gt;1 Limbo-low-nose (with Velcro pad)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The five limbo blocks are stacked on top of each other on the floor with the limbo bar on the top.  Players take it in turns to wear the &amp;quot;Limbo-low-nose&amp;quot; and bend over an pick up the limbo bar with their nose.  This must be achieved with only the feet in contact with the floor.  Each player has three attempts - players who cannot do this, or touch the floor with any part of their body other than their feet are eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once everyone has succeeded or been eliminated the bar is lowered by removing one of the limbo blocks so that the limbo bar is now resting on four blocks.  Players now attempt at this height.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues in this way, gradually reducing the height of the bar until either only one player is left or until at least two players have successfully picked up the bar from the floor.  If this happens all five blocks are placed under the limbo bar again, and the exercise repeated, but this time players are only allowed to stand on one foot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
