							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cake or Death</name>
									
			<description>Baking in the afterlife is a dangerous business! Bake the best cakes, and everything will be fine: anything less, and you'll be punished. Of course, Death is always around, trying to sneak a taste.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cake or Death is a quick, light game where players collect various types of cake while trying to avoid Death. Slices of cake count against a player in the final scoring, unless a player has the most of a specific type. Collect the most slices of any particular cake, and it won't count against you. Unfortunately, Death is never welcome, and it's worth two slices of cake each time it shows up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player draws a hand of cards, depicting various types of cake or Death. A player may secretly discard one and then must display one remaining card face up. The remaining cards remain hidden. The other players then name a type of cake and take all cards depicting the named type (possibly the one displayed face up), adding them to their permanent collection. However, if the player has no cake of the named type, then Death may show up instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the players run through the entire deck. The player with the most slices of any particular type of cake discards all cards of that type. Death always sticks around. Every remaining slice of cake adds one to your final score, while each Death counts as two. The player with the lowest score wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
