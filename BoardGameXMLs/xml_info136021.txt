			<description>The advent of 2mm scale figures represents a major step forward for those who wish to wargame the large-scale engagements of the past with miniatures. These rules use a groundscale of 22cm to the mile which makes it possible to model the very large areas occupied by big American Civil War battles on tables of conventional size.&lt;br/&gt; The rules use a 'Variable Length Bound' system developed by George Jeffrey. This diffres considerably from the 'fixed turn' systems but it is logical, easy to use, and gives a game a more realistic feel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;American Civil War Rules for an Army-level Wargame with 2mm or 6mm Miniatures system hinges upon one rule. Once the first set of orders have been written (called the initial battle orders). commanders may not write further orders except in response to a change in their command situation (Change of Situation). There are a total of thirteen general Changes of Situation including enemy forces appearing/changing direction, enemy opens or ceases fire on you forces, a unit underv your command rallies, falls back, or is broken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2mm Groundscale: 1mm = 8 yards&lt;br/&gt;2mm Figure Scale: 1 infantry block = 150 men, 1 skirmisher strip = 30 men, 1 cavalry block = 100 men (2 cavalry blocks dismount to form 1 infantry block leaving one horse-holder per 4 horses). 1 gun = Battery of 6 guns. Light arillery needs 1 limber, heavier batteries need a wagon as well to represent their extra caissons. Confererate artillery should be re-organised into 6 gun batteries or retained at 4 guns with 2/3 effect. A battery is assumed to have 100 men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players wishing to use these rules with 6mm (1/300 scale) figures should use a groundscale of 1mm = 4 yards and a 'block' frontage of 20 men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
