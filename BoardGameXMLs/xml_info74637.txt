			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1996, a little-known scientist named Doctor Julian Bergfischer Licht began to experiment in genetics. At the time, the science of genetics was far from perfect, so many mistakes were made along the way. Although his intentions of curing genetic diseases were admirable, the suffering caused was sometimes horrendous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the year 2003, the Doctor was prosecuted by a family who had lost a son to Licht's attempts at saving the boy from a genetic disorder. Licht lost the case, and received a heavy fine and long jail sentence. He died while imprisoned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, he left behind a frightening legacy: not all of his 'mistakes' had died. Many were sterile, but others married and had children normally - and the Risen were the result. The Risen are the children of Dr. Licht's failures, the enduring proof that men in fact can play God.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But what were the risks? The powers of Risen children started manifesting around the age of puberty, an age of raging hormones and strong emotions. Most Risen could control themselves, and others had nondestructive powers, but some were not so mild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the first Risen were spotted in 2025, they were wonders. By 2026, they were freaks. And in the year 2027, they became animals fit for nothing but hunting. The most dangerous beast has always made the most valuable prize.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
