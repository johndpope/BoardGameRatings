			<description>User Summary: A Kickstarter project for Reign available for free on the web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NAIN is a complete, fully laid out miniature setting for the REIGN roleplaying game ( &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.gregstolze.com/reign/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.gregstolze.com/reign/&lt;/a&gt; ). If the ransom is met, I'll release the PDFs onto the internet, for free, in perpetuity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by JK Rowling, Fritz Leiber and Gormenghast, Nain is a kingdom dominated by wizards. Any family could have an enchanter born into it, waiting to be swept into one of the three great schools to harness his power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The supplement contains...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A description of the nation, its tragic history, and its uncertain future.&lt;br/&gt;     Descriptions of enchantment's peculiar monsters, with an easy One-Roll system for generating more.&lt;br/&gt;     Company stats for the great families of wizardry, their hidden rivals, and the secretive cabals that pursue magical enlightenment... or the darkest of blasphemies.&lt;br/&gt;     A redesigned magic system, built from the ground up to provide flexibility, uncertainty, and character focus. Knowledge is the spark of sorcery, but passion is the fuel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're a long-time REIGN fan, NAIN presents an entirely new setting. If you're just getting started with Enchiridion there's no better way to see the system at work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
