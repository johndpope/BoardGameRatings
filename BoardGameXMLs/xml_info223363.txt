							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Not My President: The Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is Not My President?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I bet you&amp;rsquo;re asking yourself, what is this? Let me start off &amp;ndash; I love games. I do. I do. Don&amp;rsquo;t let anyone tell you otherwise: nobody loves games more than me, and when it comes to games, I love them. I do. I&amp;rsquo;ve made plenty of games &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;ve provided more games to the American people than Obama ever will, ever has been, will go, games. And this one &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s the greatest game of all time, mark my words. The best. Anyone that says different &amp;ndash; we&amp;rsquo;re fighting a war here, ladies and gentlemen, a war, against fake news. If this game doesn&amp;rsquo;t get funded, we&amp;rsquo;ll know &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s phony, America. This game is going to be huge. *Small loans of a million dollars are accepted and encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How It Works?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based off the popular game Mafia, Not My President is a high-energy, 3-12 player game of deception that lasts 5-10 minutes per round. Using your best poker face, diversionary tactics, and a lot of finger pointing, the goal of Not My President is to either find the Trump Supporters amongst you, or, if you are one, to keep yourself hidden through any means necessary. Lying, spreading chaos, and blaming others are highly encouraged tactics. The game begins when players randomly select and privately view a &amp;ldquo;role card,&amp;rdquo; dividing the party into two groups: Trump Supporters and Reasonable People. Players then close their eyes for the election night. During this phase, the free app guides you through the special abilities of your assigned roles. Players secretly swap cards, change identities, and cause more mayhem than a private email server. When everyone has taken their turn, players open their eyes, and the accusations begin. After 5-10 minutes, players vote for who they believe to be the most likely Trump Supporter. If they&amp;rsquo;re wrong, the Trump Supporters win. If they&amp;rsquo;re right, it&amp;rsquo;s probably fake news, and the Reasonable People win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Narration:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because this game is so great and since we don't want anyone to feel left out of the party we have made a free downloadable app to narrate the game! Trust me its not Skynet, an extremely credible source told me so. Includes adjustable settings and soundtracks for those of you who like to spice things up a little.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
