			<description>From the box cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After months of training and preparation, the Great Crusade begins, with the landing of eight Allied infantry and parachute divisions in Normandy. Facing them on the beaches and in the hedgerows are some of the finest, and worst, formations in the German Army. Except for the near disaster on Omaha Beach, the landings go well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both sides begin the race to build up, and the Allies, with total command of the seas and skies, begin to pull ahead of the Germans as the month of June wears on. The Allies are under intense pressure to advance quickly, and not just for purely military reasons. Progress, however, is painfully slow. The British Second Army, scheduled to take Caen on D-Day, is held up short of that objective with heavy losses for the entire month by fanatical and skillful German resistance. The Americans face weaker opposition, and despite taking the port of Cherbourg, they become bogged down in the endless maze of hedgerows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can the Germans buy enough time to form more reserves and stave off disaster? Can the Allies break the stalemate earlier than they actually did and perhaps win the war sooner? Play June 6th and find out for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
