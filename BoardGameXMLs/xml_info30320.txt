			<description>The game is designed to cover land warfare in Europe 1618-1660.  The emphasis is on continental warfare rather than the English Civil War.  Scale in one inch = 40 yards for 15mm figures, one figure = 50 men and each turn represents 30-45 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic unit is a regiment or brigade sized unit depending on the national force being represented.  These are then organized into Division which are in turn organized into Wings.  Two or more wings is an army.  During play each unit receives a number of actions called Operations depending on a variety of situation factors.  These are then used to execute movement and other tactical operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules provide diagrams of historical formations, army lists, and scenarios for the battles of Lutzen (1632), Jankow (1645 -- erroneously listed as 1635 in the contents page) and Anfangsthal (1644).  A separate expansion, called for God, King, Pulk and Orta provides additional optional rules as well as additional army lists for Eastern Europe and the English Civil War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
