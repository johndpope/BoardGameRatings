			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the file's introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the influx of Shadow into our world, musty tomes and relics imbued with mystic powers are beginning to surface everywhere. Many who desire power above all else go to great pains to find and use such items, regardless of the cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One self-taught Mage employed such a relic&amp;mdash;a book of dark and arcane lore&amp;mdash;to learn the secret of creating constructs from dead human flesh. Though he was able to meet most of his needs with the bounty of dead flesh stored at the local morgue, he discovered that certain body parts had to meet particular specifications, and murder was the best way to obtain those. So he launched a killing spree that lasted until one of his would-be victims turned the tables and slew him. Now that his creations are free, they will continue to act on his last commands until they too are stopped once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TEAM BRAVO: Touch of Death is an adventure set in the modern era, but it includes fantastic elements such as dark magic and blasphemous creations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Short Adventure for Four 6th-Level Heroes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
