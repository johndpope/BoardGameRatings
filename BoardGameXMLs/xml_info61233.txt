			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blood Runs Cold is a bloody cool D20 system adventure for four to six characters of 10th-12th level. The setting for the module is in and around the generic town of Rivenwater. A good Referee can easily adapt it to any setting or plunk Rivenwater into an area in their campaign. Blood Runs Cold is a classic adventure featuring five new monsters, players handouts, a battlemap and gorgeous maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Many generations ago the land that is now the Blackened Fen was actually the thriving and warlike city-state of Shyyth. Populated by a race of evil humans knows as Annelids, Shyyth was a religious center of dark renown where the Annelids held sacrifice to their vile god Hirudinea. The Annelids worshipped the Drinker of Life, Lord of Slime and Leeches. They tattooed their bodies in leech-like patterns of mud brown and deep ochre and drank the blood of their enemies. As penance their priests would attach leeches to the exposed parts of their bodies, always feeding their essence to the Drinker in return for His granted powers.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
