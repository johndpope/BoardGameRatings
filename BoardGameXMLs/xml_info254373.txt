			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trucker is a program which simulates the problems facing a long-haul truck driver.  Ideally, you can make a good living hauling freight coast-to-coast without exceeding the legal load limit.  If all goes well, you can obey the speed limits and stop each night for eight hours sleep and still make the time schedule.  On a good trip you will be able to earn well over $1,000.  however, even the best drivers run into occasional streaks of bad luck and may barely break even.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trucker was written by Richard R. Glabraith and published as type-in source code in Creative Computing Vol 7, No 3, March 1981.  The simulation was created in response to a previous challenge, and was selected as the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
