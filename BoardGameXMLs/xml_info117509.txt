			<description>Horse-themed dexterity/action game for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: one metal tin, one cardboard chit, 40 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect 6 cards wins the game. The cards are shuffled and placed face down on the table. The active player puts the metal tin on or next to the cards, compresses its lid and places the chit on the lid. Then the lid is compressed at the sides, which catapults the chit into the air. If the chit doesn't land on one of the cards, the active player selects a card to be returned to the box and it's the next player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;If the chit does land on a card, the active player turns that card over and does what the card requires: text-based cards are read aloud and the player tries to complete the task (e.g. pretending to be an excited horse, making a few steps on all fours with a book on one's back). If he/she is successful, he/she earns that card. Other cards are earned by being the fastest to grab the tin or the chit. If the chit lands on the tin, the active player gets to steal a card from another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player has collected 6 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
