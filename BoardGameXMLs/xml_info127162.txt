			<description>A novel target game. The target ,so-to-speak,is a clown holding up 5 hoops. Each hoop is worth points, the amount of points depends on the size of the hoops. The two smallest are worth 50 points each, the middle-sized hoop is worth 25 points and the two largest hoops are worth 10 points each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To score these points you must launch the paper hat pieces one at a time. You place a hat on one end of a springboard in the shape of a clown. Hold down the end where the hat is and let go. The hat will be sprung forward, hopefully at the target. If it goes through a hoop you score the appropriate points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points when the game has to be finished, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Klee made this game for the export market because they used their Clover logo on the rules (but the traditional Klee logo on the box. Klee is the German word for Clover).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
