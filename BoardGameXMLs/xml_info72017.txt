							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sneak Attack</name>
									
			<description>From the description of the game:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;When war comes, humans no longer man the battlefield. Wars are fought by mechs, giant robots, remotely controlled from far-away bases, with the riders of these giant mechs completely out of harms way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nonetheless, your commanding officers have a job for you. A job putting you in the line of real danger. Intel suggests that the enemy has amassed a large force, and put them ashore outside your capital in the midst of night. Their mission? To launch nuclear missiles at your nations leader, and every monument in your capital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our engineers have sent out a signal that interrupts the mech's connection with their home base, causing them to wander meanlessly around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, you must sneak out to destroy each of the enemies' mechs, before they are powered up and ready to launch.But be careful.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sneak Attack is a free, print-to-play game designed for the &amp;quot;sneaky sci-fi game contest&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;During play, you will move around a hexagonal board depicting a battlefield. The player will attempt to sneak up on enemy mechs, destroying them with EMP charges, in order to save their home, and the pride of their country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
