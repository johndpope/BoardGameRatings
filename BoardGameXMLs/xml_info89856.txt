							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Hour Between Dog and Wolf (1km1kt)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the years between 1764 and 1767, something killed over a hundred people in the Gevaudan region of southern France. Popular opinion was that it was a wolf, but survivors&amp;rsquo; accounts suggest otherwise. Under considerable scrutiny from outside, King Louis XV mounted no fewer than three offensives aimed at delivering to him The Beast of Gevaudan. In his name, hundreds of wolves were slaughtered, but he never caught the real Beast. Perhaps he should have consulted with the wolves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
