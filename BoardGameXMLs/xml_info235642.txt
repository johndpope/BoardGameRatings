			<description>The players start at &amp;quot;Start&amp;quot;. The first to reach the parking lot wins the game. Movement is determined by a die. At certain spaces, traffic related events hinder or help the players, as described in the game rules. The game is designed to teach children about traffic signs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Older editions show the traffic signs from 1927. In 1934 the game was updated to the new traffic signs. Some of these are pictured with the old arrows sill around them, being a combination of old and new.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
