			<description>This map is an unofficial fan made expansion. Symbols &amp;amp; Graphics Copyright &amp;copy; 2004-2015 Days of Wonder, Inc. Produced with permission of Days of Wonder, for non-commercial use only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This follows the principles of the Ticket to Ride Rails and Sails game on a special board with special cards and rules. The object of the game is to gain the most points by travelling various routes and outwitting other players. You will need the pieces and the cards from the base game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an extra set of Tourist cards for the cities, each with a value to be earned by visiting that city. These cards are dealt/picked up alongwith tickets in the same quantity and with the same 'keep/dispose' rules. There are also choice cards which may help or hinder you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are bonuses to give you extra points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are new options in the rules: exchange all your cards at the start but keep all the new ones: discard 5 cards and pick up 5 new ones, as your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
