							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flimbo&#039;s Quest</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A colourful scrolling platform game developped late for the Commodore 64 in 1990, when the hardware was slowly phasing out. The player controls Flimbo, a cartoonish character who wanders back and forth on the stages, avoiding and shooting enemies and collecting various power-ups to be able to clear the stage. The C64 original featured next to unbelievably colourful and well-made graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was ported to Amiga, Atari ST and Amstrad CPC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trivia: Flimbo's Quest (C64 original) is credited to Laurens Van Der Donk, a Dutch programmer, and was rumoured to run on the exact same code as Thalamus' game Hawkeye from 1988, programmed by the Dutch group Boys without Brains. Indeed the games are identical in gameplay, while Hawkeye has a grittier graphics style. The music in both games was also done by the same group of Dutch musicians, Maniacs of Noise, of which Jeoren Tel, who made the music for Hawkeye, was a member.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other trivia: According to Wikipedia, the C64 version was released on a cartridge with 4-games-in-one. Whether the game was ever released on floppy or cassette for the C64 is unknown; but the game was nonetheless spread on pirate floppy disk versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits:&lt;br/&gt;Johannes Bjerregaard: Title &amp;amp; Level music (C64)&lt;br/&gt;Reyn Ouwehand: Intro music (C64)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
