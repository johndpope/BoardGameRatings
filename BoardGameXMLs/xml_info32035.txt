			<description>Be the first player to populate the central goal line with your pawns.  How you accomplish this can differ depending on the rule variant used.  Examples include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;King of the Hill:  Roll the dice and move one pawn either the number of spaces shown on one die, or the total of the two dice.  Keep rolling and moving until a six is showing on either die, or doubles other than ones are rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;King of Battle:  Roll the dice.  Not only are you attempting to get your men to the goal line, but you are also shooting at them in an attempt to hinder their progress.  Wounded pawns are removed from the board, but can be re-introduced later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virtually Golfing:  Each track is a hole, and are played sequentially.  Roll the dice, and move your pawn the lower of the two numbers towards the goal.  Roll double ones and you hole out.  Any other doubles mean a swing and a miss.  Par is 5 for each hole, and the lowest score after all holes are played wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game includes 12 pawns (6 of each color), two dice, rules, and a game board.  The rules and game board can also be downloaded and printed from the &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://game.peopling.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://game.peopling.net/&lt;/a&gt; website, and played using your own pawns and dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
