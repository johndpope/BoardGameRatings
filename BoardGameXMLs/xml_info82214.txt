							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cleric Token Set</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sets contain many tokens and tiles as well as an invisibility stand-in for your Player Character&amp;rsquo;s miniature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in each set is a Character Status Tile. This durable plastic tile is a handy reference for all the variable stats that can change during combat. The tile is designed to work with wet erase markers so you can quickly modify your status as it changes in battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Action Point Tile is a handy reminder for players to make an extraordinary move to turn the tide of combat. The Light Source token can be slipped onto the base of your model when your character is carrying one of the party&amp;rsquo;s torches or lanterns. The Bloodied token conveniently marks your model when the battle begins to take its toll, while the Dying token reminds your companions that your ranger is grasping onto the last threads of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The set also includes personalized Dragonscale-shaped tokens for your character. Scale tokens fit neatly around the base of your model, or can be placed on the Status Tile or your character sheet. The Marked token can be placed on the miniature you&amp;rsquo;ve designated as your Hunter&amp;rsquo;s Quarry. The Total Defense token shows when your character is focusing on staying alive rather than attacking. A Concealment token indicates that your ranger is laying in wait for her prey. The remaining scale tokens have iconic ranger imagery that the player can define for use for a wide range of effects and reminders during combat (For example, the arrow tokens are perfect for marking the corners of an area of effect attack on the Battle Grid).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally the Mount Token is used to increase the base size of your miniature to a large model when your character is riding a horse or vehicle. This Large size token can also represent your riderless mount on the Battle Grid. The Invisibility Stand-Up replaces your miniature when your character is rendered invisible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
