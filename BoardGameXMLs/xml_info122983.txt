			<description>The objective of the game is to hunt various animals, such as deer, elk, and bighorn. Falling off ledges or logs, stepping on noisy terrain, shooting female animals, and attacking aggressive animals can all lead to a game over. There is also a minigame mode to the game. It allows up to four players to shoot at the best score. There is an arcade mode for one player also. This game does not have wi-fi connectivity.&lt;br/&gt;Some animals in the game will try to attack you. Sometimes you have to throw or shove your gun at them to keep from getting hurt. If you are hurt, the screen will turn red. If this happens too many times you will have a Game Over. Animals can also sense the danger. At the top of the screen it will show an alert notice when the animals know you are there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2010&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
