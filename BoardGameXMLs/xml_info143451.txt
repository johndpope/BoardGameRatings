							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">AT-43 Unit Box: Hekat Golgoth</name>
									
			<description>The Hekat is a light combat strider based on an ancient design, whose function is long forgotten. Terribly efficient in contact (it can even threaten even the mighty support golgoths), It moves at lightening speed and can carried out simple handling tasks such as moving low walls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paradoxically, this golgoth intended for close combat, is the dreaded enemy of any armored fighting vehicle! At first, the concept was met by the extremely fierce opposition of the most traditionalist overseers until it proved its efficiency on the battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speed is the Hekat&amp;rsquo;s main asset. No other golgoth serving at the moment can challenge it in that field. Its powerful grim scythes allow it to tear through the thickest of armor. As for the infantry, it hardly needs any chewing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combination of its maneuverability and the simplicity in the use of its armament make it a remarkable armored fighting vehicle unit, whose deployment and use are exceptionally straightforward: Full throttle ahead, hit anything standing in the way, trample the infantry and slash through as many enemy striders as you can find until the unavoidable surrender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This unit box contains a unit of 1 miniature, 3 low walls and 2 reference cards for AT-43.The Hekat is a light combat strider based on an ancient design, whose function is long forgotten.
