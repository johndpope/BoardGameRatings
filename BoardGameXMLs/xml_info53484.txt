							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sea Elves</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Complete Culture for Elfquest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Descended from a band of High Ones who were cut off from their fellows soon after the palace landed, the Sea Elves developed a unique culture. Their isolation has caused them, like the Wolfriders, to adapt to a lifestyle different from that to which most elves are accustomed. The Sea Elves inhabit hundreds of islands which arc across the Vastdeep water to form a great archipelago. Some of the islands are barren, some are lush and fertile, nearly all are actively volcanic. The elves live a life that is, like their island homes, at once harsh and beautiful. Life is often short; very old elves are uncommon on the islands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
