			<description>How many of you remember the old videogames of the '80s &amp;ndash; '90s where you had to be extremely skilled in cabinet to strip completely super-pixelled girls?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oppai Go has been created from this idea, a &amp;ldquo;strategic&amp;rdquo; game in which each player has a sexy female alter ego taken on a desert island as a sort of &amp;ldquo;Battle Royale&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;The Hunger Games&amp;rdquo;, with the exception of only wearing underwear. Unfortunately the fate is not by your side (or maybe yes?), because you will be &amp;ldquo;forced&amp;rdquo; to use every means at your disposal to fully undress your opponents and try to earn your way back home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to have the most victory points at the end. Players get VP by stripping their opponents of their clothes (or accessories).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The accessory token moves from one space to another to denote the state of dress of each character. The possible states are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;1. Naked: The accessory token is off the character sheet and the character is flipped to the naked side&lt;br/&gt;2. Pants: The character is only wearing pants (token on pants space)&lt;br/&gt;3. Bra: The character is wearing bra and pants (token on bra space)&lt;br/&gt;4. Armor: The character is wearing bra and pants, and also armor (token on armor space)&lt;br/&gt;5. Weapon: The character has a weapon, armor, bra and panties (token on weapon space)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided into rounds, each round is split into phases. Note that some phases are played in clockwise order and some others in anticlockwise order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player faces a round always with 3 cards in hand, drawing them from the central common deck. Cards could have some effects like removing accessories to an opponent (or to everyone), gain 1 accessory, defend from opposing actions, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards can be played by the hand, can be held (covered) on the table (to be played during the next rounds) or can be discarded. All played cards form a sort of pile in order to activate their effects from the last played card to the first one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The held cards go always on the top of the pile, so their effects start first. There's only one problem: the card on the top of the discard pile determines the Seed, that is the color of cards that cannot be played among the held ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game full of funny surprises, bluff, ruthless combos and embarrassing situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
