			<description>A poker style card game for 2 players.  The premise of the game is that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer and that the gap between the rich and the poor has been increasing for decades. Each hand represents 10 years starting with the 1950s. One player is the Rich. The other player is the Poor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck of 7 card types of 8 cards each.  Three of these (Rent Seeking, Tax Evasion and Extraction) can be used by the Rich player; three others (Enlightened, Investment and Reaction) can be used by the Poor player.  The 7th suit (Neutral) can be used by both players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a turn 5 cards are dealt to each player. Each player may discard up to 3 cards and draw replacements. Players then reveal their hands and score them.  Each player will have cards they can and cannot use and score points as follows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hand:         Notes:                Points:&lt;br/&gt;1 Pair        2 of the same suit        2&lt;br/&gt;3 of a Kind    3 of the same suit        4&lt;br/&gt;4 of a Kind    4 of the same suit        6&lt;br/&gt;5 of a Kind    5 of the same suit        8&lt;br/&gt;2 Pairs        2 pairs from different suits    5&lt;br/&gt;Full House    1 pair and 1 3 of a kind    7&lt;br/&gt;Flush        4 from 4 different suits    5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of 7 hands, the player with the most points wins. If the rich player wins, it is business as usual. If the poor player wins, then the world is a better place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
