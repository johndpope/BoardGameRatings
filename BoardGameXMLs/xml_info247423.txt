							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Die Hitman</name>
									
			<description>Die Hitman is a tactical solitaire assassination game, where you play as a hitman trying to take down the Target, an evil man of many underhanded deeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Target moves about the town, while crooks and cops lurk about. Hiding in the crowds, the hitman must work to find the opportune time to hit the Target. The hitman has an arsenal of guns, bombs, and poison to attempt to get the target, but one false move and it is game over!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is setup by laying out 25 cards in a 5x5 grid that makes the town. The Target starts at a random location, but he moves throughout the night. With proper intel and planning, the hitman looks to get the upper hand and strike the Target at the right moment. But even with the Target right under his nose, if the hitman strikes at the wrong time the heat can be on him in an instant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hitman only gets so many turns, until the Target will escape to the Helipad. During that time period, the Alert Level gets higher causing the cops and crooks to move further attempting to find and corner the hitman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Die Hitman plays in less than 30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Die Hitman contains:&lt;br/&gt;25 Location cards&lt;br/&gt;20 Target cards&lt;br/&gt;5 Tool cards&lt;br/&gt;2 Player Aides&lt;br/&gt;Dice and counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
