			<description>&amp;quot;Similar to its predecessor, Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Rogue Leader is a fast-paced, flight action game. Each of the game's ten levels introduces mission objectives such as search and destroy or protection that must be completed to progress to the next level. Enemy aircraft are primarily composed of TIE fighters, Imperial shuttles and Star Destroyers. Ground defenses are more varied and include three different walkers, various laser turrets, probe droids and stormtroopers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heads-up display features a health meter, a radar, an ammunition count for secondary weapons and the &amp;quot;command cross&amp;quot; that allows the player to give limited instructions to their wingmen. The player can control six craft: X-wing, A-wing, Y-wing, B-wing, Snowspeeder and the T-16 Skyhopper. Each vehicle offers a unique armament arrangement, as well as varying degrees of speed and maneuverability. The game initially restricts the player to a particular craft for each level; however, after a level is completed, it can be replayed with any available craft. Some levels offer the player the option to change craft mid-level. Eleven bonus power-ups are hidden in different levels throughout the game. These bonuses improve a craft's weapons, durability and targeting computer and are applied to each eligible craft for the remainder of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player's performance is measured throughout the game, and performance statistics are checked after each level against three medal benchmarks. Each benchmark contains six categories: completion time, number of enemies destroyed, shot accuracy, number of friendly craft and structures saved, number of lives lost and targeting computer efficiency. If a player's performance meets or exceeds one of the level's three benchmarks in all six categories, a medal&amp;mdash;bronze, silver or gold&amp;mdash;is awarded on completion. Acquiring these medals promotes the player's rank and helps unlock hidden content. Once the player completes all of the training missions and achieves gold medals on all 15 levels, the opportunity to activate &amp;quot;Ace Mode&amp;quot; is awarded. The player may then achieve one more medal per level by completing them with this mode activated.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Star_Wars_Rogue_Squadron_II:_Rogue_Leader,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
