			<description>In this game, you play as Derin Hawk, a dedicated soldier trying desperately to stop the enemy known as Them. They emerged long ago and have quickly destroyed the once peaceful nation. Now, you must enter the mountain from which they came, in hopes of finding a way to stop them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After picking a mission, you will use the appropriate enemy cards and weapons. By taking cover (and you must take cover, or you WILL die) and laying strategic fire, you will be able to advance through the map. Do you use an action to move spaces, or do you cover fire? Do you take cover after you move, or stand in the open? And what weapons do you pick up or save for later?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat uses many dice, as you roll die equal to your power, scoring a hit for each dice equal to your accuracy. You deal the weapons damage for each hit. Enemies follow the same rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not one of those games where the enemies are weaker but more numerous. It is where the enemies are both the same as you and more numerous. Ha! Ha!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you save humanity?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
