			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An octet of awfulness - eight richly detailed deviant and demoniac villains for your campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For every great hero, you need a great villain, and this product contains monsters. Complete monsters. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean just the fact that they are not human, although certainly many of them are the fiendish spawn of the deepest pits of the lower planes. I mean ALL of them are completely rotten, vile, awful, vicious, conniving, underhanded, perverse, depraved, double-dealing, backstabbing, lying, cheating rat-bastard scum. These villains want to destroy every noble thought and impulse your heroes ever had, to pollute the springs of righteousness that bring hope and joy, leaving nothing but desolate wells of wickedness in their wake. They are the stuff of nightmares, borne from the fervid imaginings of Todd Stewart, Nicolas Logue, Clinton J. Boomer, and Alistair Rigg, and rendered in disturbing detail by our amazing artists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this product you will find villains are borne out of perverted passion and odious obsession like Ser Meridrand Pallisard, a paladin fallen far below the pale for sake of shame, despair, gluttony, and lust, to the quiet whisperings of Malcaedix the shadow demon, clinging to the shadow of innocents and their innocence. Some are capricious, like Lilevyrrin the gun-fighting succubus seductress and Koyo-Shojaxus, a faux-ascetic babau wanderer-cum-master of the martial arts. Still others are devious and calculating, including the glabrezu summoner Mons'Verix calling down false angels that mock the heavens, The Bound Horror plotting its return to greater power, or the tragic possession of the mythic coloxus Dasnikynlin turning individual lives or entire families into its private playgrounds, like the corrupted inquisitor Count Ulus VonKaval. As fodder for simple encounters, they offer challenges from CR 9 to 16, but more importantly each provides a story and motivation that provides a foundation for entire adventures and arcs that can span a campaign. Every one presents a different face of chaos and evil, but each offers a wealth of possibilities to enrich a game where the corrupting draw of the nether realms threatens to pull every hero into the figurative (if not literal) abyss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ideally suited as a supplement for the &amp;quot;Righteous Crusade&amp;quot; Adventure Path, Unrighteous Villains is a terrific resource for any campaign where demons and their influence goes beyond simple violence and descends into true horror and vileness. Pick up this 32-page supplement today and Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
