			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crazy Comets is a 1985 Commodore 64 game written by Simon Nicol and published by Martech. The game is a still-screen shoot'em-up, where the player controls a space craft and must shoot down all enemies that enter the screen, stage after stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the gameplay is 2D, the screen simulates a three-dimensional view, and the spaceship is actually pointing into the screen. Enemies often first appear as small dots, slowly growing larger, and cannot hurt the ship until they have come close enough. They can, however, be shot down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Typical to Crazy Comets are the obstacles with a &amp;quot;homing missile&amp;quot; movement, and much of the game play consists of dodging these homing dangers all the while shooting them down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits:&lt;br/&gt;Simon Nicol: Design, program&lt;br/&gt;Rob Hubbard: Music (C64)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
