							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Next Big Thing: The Game of Entrepreneurship</name>
									
			<description>A board game for people who are interested in being startup superheroes, changing the world, and becoming billionaires. Players take on the role of startup founders to create &amp;quot;the next big thing&amp;quot;, bootstrapping using their initial cash savings and superpower skills (i.e. programming, design, sales, marketing, etc.) to create a minimal viable product, gain initial traction, and then go on to raise multiple rounds of capital from investors, increasing the value of their company, but while also having their founder's ownership get diluted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game players will experience many of the ups and downs of the entrepreneurial journey including: increasing revenues while balancing against expenses to grow the company, various significant events (good and bad), and creating an impact that changes the world. There are also multiple paths such as an accelerator path, pivot paths, and in the end (if you haven't gone bankrupt) players decide to either take the acquisition path or IPO path. Along the way players also collect impact points, as it's not just about the money, from sustainability, ethics &amp;amp; diversity, social impact, and health &amp;amp; wellness. The winner is the player who exits (&amp;quot;cashes out&amp;quot;) with the most money by creating the company with the largest valuation while still maintaining the most founder's ownership and generating the most positive impact on the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
