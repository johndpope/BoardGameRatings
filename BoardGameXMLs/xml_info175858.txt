							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Skylanders Skystones</name>
									
			<description>The origins of Skystones go way back to the days of the Benevolent Ancients. While experimenting with early Portal technology and magic, they discovered a form of enchanted stone that would allow anything painted on it to become real. The Ancients worried that this power might fall into the wrong hands so they turned it into a strategy game purely for fun and leisure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect all 4 SKYSTONE sets. 40 cards in all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four different skystone packs could be found inside marked boxes of General Mills cereal during the month of March 2015, and are used to play Skystones using the game board found on the back of the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is identical to the mini-game within the Skylanders series of video games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 3x3 grid with skystone that are red on one side and blue on the other. The object is to have more of your color skystones on the grid than your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 5 skystone cards dealt from a shuffled deck, and players take turns placing one of their cards with their color face up into any open space on the board. When a player places their skystone next to one or more of an opponent's skystones a battle takes place. If the attacking player wins, the defending player must flip their skystone so that it now shows the attacking player's color. Play continues until all 9 spaces are filled. The player with the most skystones of their color is the victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
