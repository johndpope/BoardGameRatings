			<description>Pieces is a 1994 puzzle game for the SNES made by Atlus. In the game, the player has to solve jigsaw puzzles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can either face a computer, or up to five human players. The computer players come at three levels (easy, normal, or hard) and feature a wide array of opponents, such as a crab made out of a rice bowl and a beautiful, laughing mermaid. A few puzzles must be solved before the opponent solves his or her puzzles. If the player is quick enough, items will appear. These can do anything from guiding the puzzle pieces to freezing the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pieces (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
