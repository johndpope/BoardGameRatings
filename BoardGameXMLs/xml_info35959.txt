			<description>&amp;quot;Feed me!&amp;quot; the little yellow seal begs the zoo keeper.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;No, feed me first &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m much more hungry!&amp;quot; the green seal whines.&lt;br/&gt;And at once all four seals open their mouth and start howling. Desperately the zoo keeper looks from one seal to the other &amp;ndash; which one should he feed first? A smart idea occurs to him; &amp;quot;Lets play a game together.Whoever wins, gets a fish!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Hurray, playing games is fun!&amp;quot; the seals cheer and flap their flippers. Impatiently they wait for the game to start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 1. Feeding the Seals&lt;br/&gt;Roll the die. If a colored seal appears either open or close it's mouth (on the game board). If a fish appears, and the corresponding seal's mouth is open, feed it. The game ends as soon as a player has fed a seal with their last fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 2. No, no &amp;ndash; I Don&amp;rsquo;t Like Fish!&lt;br/&gt;This is a variant of Go Fish, but with the fish tiles and the open mouthed seals on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 3. I want fish!&lt;br/&gt;As in Game #1 but each players has a secret seal (color) identity. When feeding a seal, if your color's mouth is closed, you must feed someone else's seal. The player whose seal has eaten the most fish wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
