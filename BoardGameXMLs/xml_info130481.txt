			<description>Another British/Ireland map for Ticket to Ride game made by Wiebke L&amp;uuml;demann (Illustration) and Stefan Grunhold (Strategy).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board which is 70 x 80 cm in size, connects United Kingdom with the rest of Europe (e.g. Amsterdam in The Netherlands as well as Bergen and Stavanger in Norway, Helgoland in Germany, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. In addition to the original Ticket to Ride Europe this map contains routes which are 7 waggons in length - scoring 18 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. The design and illustration is truly unique and awesome. The ferry routes are multi-colored (instead of having the original's grey color / locomotive symbol on it). Due to the integration of some &amp;quot;overseas&amp;quot;-destinations, a lot of ferries are available. The same is true for tunnels, which are indicated by rounded boxes. Here, I was missing the clearer tunnel borders from the original, but it is not a big disadvantage. The tickets look wonderful - long and short routes are clearly distinguishable. A lot of love, energy and enthusiam has been put into the illustration. Congratulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. The scoring track is a great novelty as it uses railroad tracks in the background which looks really nice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
