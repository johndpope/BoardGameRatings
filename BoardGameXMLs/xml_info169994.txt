							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Global Diversity Game for International Relief and Development Organizations</name>
									
			<description>From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;The Global Diversity Game for International Relief and Development Organizations is a highly interactive training tool using a multiple-choice quiz format to explore facts about global diversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to be the first to reach the center square of the board, and answer a question correctly to win.  Players start on the &amp;quot;Go&amp;quot; square and roll dice to move around the track. On each space where they land, they must answer a question from one of six decks, all of which focus on some aspect of global diversity. A correct answer earns the player a colored chip.  Tow chips of any one color may be traded for a single chip of any other color. When they have all outer track chips, players may move into the inner track. The first player to reach the center space and answer a question chosen by the team to their left wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
