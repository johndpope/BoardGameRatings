			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Times have always been tough in the Walk of Man. Being a hearty breed, those who live there generally like it that way. Why else would anyone live in one of the most rugged settled area of the planet? But as of late, times have been a little too tough for comfort for the average man of the Walk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Political dissidents called the Rusty Stars have been staging a protest rally every time someone turns around, sabotaging legitimate efforts of the government, and all in favor of allowing every man to have a voice, and free elections. Not necessarily a bad idea, but they sure have an awful way of selling the idea. A lot of their chaos has slowed production, causing layoffs for people, so public sympathy for the cause isn&amp;rsquo;t what it could be, despite their turn for the worse having started with a shootout instigated by the entrenched government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the unemployed have been forced to find money through banditry, turning many young men and women away from their honest lives to banditry just to put food in their bellies, and the bellies of their families. This has torn many families apart of late, and almost everyone knows at least one person who&amp;rsquo;s had to turn away from an otherwise honest life to keep themselves above water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To top it all off, animal attacks in the northern reaches are reaching record highs, with at least one small town completely wiped off the map by a rare Grim Stalker attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the sake of bringing stability back to the region without calling in the military from Warhead, the Voice of the West, the no longer quite so esteemed leadership of Trapper Town and her dependents, has declared The Season of Gunshots open.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All able bodied men and women who need work and don&amp;rsquo;t have too much of a history of theft, rape or murder are invited to pick up a badge, and be deputized as members of the newly formed Allied Regional Militia. Once deputized, basic room and board will be provided, as well as work helping to clean up their troubled home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But not all are here just for the money. Some see it as a stepping stone to law enforcement, and yet others see it as a patriotic duty. There are even a few people from abroad who see it as a civic duty to help their cousins in the Walk of Man. Regardless, you find yourself here today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note: It appears this is from the forthcoming New Horizon Game Master's Guide, 2nd Edition, but is also available as a separate download on the New Horizon Studios website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
