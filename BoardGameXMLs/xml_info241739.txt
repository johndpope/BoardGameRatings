			<description>Lost My Mummy is a two player, set collection game. You are racing your opponent to find your mummies by collecting information about them. This could be the canopic jar, the embalming material, the amulet, or even a death wish. This information is depicted on the cards and these are what you collect over the course of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the main dynamic of the game are the dice. These are all bespoke dice that slow up an opponent or speed you up in your race to collect the cards that you need. They have low, medium or high numbers on them and this determines the range of choice that you have to select cards on your turn. Once found, you can then collect the reward for your found Mummy. The player with the most reward money, wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This family-friendly game plays at a number of levels, from simple enjoyable gameplay to more complex strategies to win! Over time, players develop a better understanding about how to find their mummies in the quickest time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The artwork is very detailed and allows for children to really explore the area of Egyptian mummification. They are actively learning about a period of history, without actually realising the information is going in! This is the power of this little card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
