			<description>Also nowen as Klassrooms &amp;amp; Matrons, the roll-playing game of british educashun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Preface (with Correct Spelling):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the second &amp;ldquo;edition&amp;rdquo; of this game, with some minor changes and clarifications since the (unnumbered) first version that circulated in British gaming circles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As these rules, as written, include a number of references to copyright material, and as, when I wrote them, I didn&amp;rsquo;t believe that any then-existing role-playing games magazine had the right combination of cultural grasp, sense of humour, and technical quality to both wish and be able to present them properly, I decided to circulate them privately as the games equivalent of &amp;ldquo;charityware.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
