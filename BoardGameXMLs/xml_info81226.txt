			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We answer to the beat of the drum, and the people of our tribe gather in a circle around the fire. The tribal elder is seated at one side, his wizened face glowing in the firelight. Dancers rise from the circle and move toward its center, loping close about the flames. The dancers don the masks of the great heroes. They are transformed, we are transported with them to a land of myth, and the tale begins, the Legend of Cold Mountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cold Mountain is a story game set in prehistoric times.  Player characters are early Cro-Magnons questing both in the real world and in the dreamtime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
