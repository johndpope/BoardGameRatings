							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NBA Jam</name>
									
			<description>This new version of the classic game, NBA Jam, is split up into two modes, a classic mode which plays like a traditional NBA Jam  experience, and a Remix Tour which features all new camera angles, power-ups, and boss battles. Players are able to choose between Wii Remote, Wii Remote and Nunchuck, Classic Controller, and Classic Controller Pro control styles. Online play is not supported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game players will have to battle NBA legends Larry Bird and Earvin &amp;quot;Magic&amp;quot; Johnson. The game also features more than 30 other legends including: Manute Bol, Clyde Drexler, Kevin McHale, Hakeem Olajuwon, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Detlef Schrempf, Spud Webb, James Worthy and Julius Erving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the bodies take on a 3D look, while their heads take on a 2D look, which gave out real digitized  likenesses. The game retains its usual exaggerated nature of play - players jumped many times above their own height, making slam dunks that defied both human capabilities and the laws of physics. There were no fouls, free throws, or violations except goaltending and 24 second violations. This meant the player was able to freely shove or elbow his opponent out of the way. Additionally, the game had an &amp;quot;on fire&amp;quot; feature, where if one player made three baskets in a row, he would become &amp;quot;on fire&amp;quot; and have unlimited turbo, no goaltending, and increased shooting ability, until the other team scored (or the player had scored four consecutive baskets while &amp;quot;on fire&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some new features are in NBA Jam include campaign, which has 1-on-1 boss battles, elimination, which includes up to four different players where the player with the lowest amount of points being the loser, 21, which is a 1-on-1 match in where the first one to get 21 points is the winner, and HORSE, where up to four players shoot where the leader shot from, and if they miss, they get a letter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is filled with easter eggs, special features and players activated by initials or button/joystick combinations. For example, players can enter special codes to unlock hidden players. Some characters could only be unlocked by requiring certain challenges to unlock hidden players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;NBA Jam (2010 video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
