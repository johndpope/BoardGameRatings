							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Peninsular Campaign</name>
									
			<description>(from Deer Valley Game Company website:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Peninsular Campaign is an operational level game using the block unit system to re-create the limited intelligance of the actual campaign. Players maneuver their forces without adequate knowledge of their opponents strengths or even location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board covers the actual and potentional topography of McClellan's offensive operations in the Spring of 1862; from the rugged hills covering Richmond's southern approach and the swamplands covering its northeast approach to the protective confines of the C.S.S. Virginia's base port of Norfolk. A point to point movement system is employed on a 20 x 24 playing map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Limited command abilities and critical supply wagons are key to managing your armies and achieving victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
