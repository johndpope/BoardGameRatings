			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the Lost Lands?&lt;br/&gt;The Lost Lands is the home campaign world of Necromancer Game's and Frog God Game's own Bill Webb. This campaign has been continuously running since 1977. Many of the adventures published by Necromancer Games and Frog God Games are directly inspired by this campaign. They have evolved over the decades, and more material continues to flow from it as the dice keep rolling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sages and wizards of legend speak of the Lost Lands&amp;mdash;many of the players who have lived and died in Bill's campaign over the years now have a place in history (in the books).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frac Cher the dwarf, Flail the Great, Bannor the Paladin, Speigle the Mage, and Helman the Halfling are well known to the fans of Bill's work. This is the game world, and these are the adventures in which the players of these famous characters lived and died. Hundreds of players over the past 35 years have experienced the thrills and terrors of this world. The Sword of Air is the centerpiece of the Lost Lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently, this epic tome consists of several parts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Hel&amp;rsquo;s Temple Dungeon&amp;mdash;kind of like Tomb of Horrors on crack. This six-level, trap-and-puzzle infested dungeon formed the basis of Bill's game through his high school and college years. Clark Peterson&amp;rsquo;s very own Bannor the Paladin spent several real life months in the place, and, sadly, finished the objective. This is where the fragments of the fabled Sword of Air can be found&amp;hellip;perhaps.&lt;br/&gt;     The Wilderness of the Lost Lands extending to the humanoid-infested Deepfells Mountains and providing detail about the nearby Wizard&amp;rsquo;s Wall. This so-called &amp;ldquo;wall&amp;rdquo; was raised by the archmages Margon and Alycthron harnessing the Spirit of the Stoneheart Mountains to raise the land itself, creating a massive escarpment to block invaders from the Haunted Steppes. These archmages are actual player characters from the early 1980s who live on in the legends of the Lost Lands. Over 70 unique encounter areas are detailed, and each one is a mini-adventure in itself. New wilderness areas may be added based on bonus goals described below!&lt;br/&gt;     The Ruined City of Tsen. Legend has it the city was destroyed by a falling meteor. This place forms an aboveground dungeon area the size of a city, with over 100 detailed encounter areas. It&amp;rsquo;s a very dark place&amp;hellip;even at noon.&lt;br/&gt;     The Wizard&amp;rsquo;s Feud&amp;mdash;This campaign-style adventure pits the players in a long-running series of intrigues and battles between two archmages. Which side will they take? Their actions all play into the overall quest, and could well determine which side wins. Law and Chaos are not always what they seem, and if the wrong decisions are made, the entire ordeal could fail. Remember, one of the wizards WANTS Tsathogga to win.&lt;br/&gt;     New monsters, new demons, new spells, and new rules for various aspects of play.&lt;br/&gt;     The Tower of Bells. This dungeon is the result of the workshop Bill ran at PaizoCon 2013, where the participants assisted him in building an old-school dungeon. Visit the tower and discover the secrets of the &amp;ldquo;artist&amp;rdquo; within. Beware: those entering may never come out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
