			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impiltur is a nation besieged by demon cults as well as aquatic raiders from the Sea of Fallen Stars in the service of the Aboleth Souvereignty. Besides the members of the High Council, it is the many priests and clerics of the numerous temples that help to keep the threat at bay. Now, the aberrations of the sea have come up with a new plan to weaken the human defenders &amp;ndash; send a raiding party deep into enemy territory and kill as many divine spellcasters as possible!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Riding a giant flood wave, the marauders have crushed an important temple of Torm and now an important religious idol as well as the daughter of the high priest are missing. However, not all is as it seems in a country of multiple conspiracies and threats and it is up to be player characters to prevent a further escalation of the situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 9th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
