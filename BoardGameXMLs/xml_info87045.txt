			<description>User Summary: Submission for the Game Chef 2010 Competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;At the crossroads, a pile of broken water-rich rock marked the road west; the north road bore a sign marked &amp;lsquo;To New Askja.&amp;rsquo; Those who could read went north. You journeyed west. West across the volcanic desert, past other greners who already marked their claims with names like Lamia, Usha&amp;rsquo;s Hole and Lunar Landing. Your claim, illegally named after your lost love, proved barren. Without money, without food, without friends, without love, taking a job meant a chance at another claim and wealth and maybe love.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The job: Deliver a skinner to Oasis, the city of exile. An exile&amp;rsquo;s fresh start means your fresh start. To help you along your journey, someone in exile hired a mercenary, a scientist, a gambler, a frontiersman, a forgotten marshal and a native. Each of you have something to gain and something to lose. You&amp;rsquo;ll journey to Oasis together, apart or alone, and deliver the skinner or be consumed by the desert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
