			<description>A variant of Tiddlywinks. Three games are described.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 1: Normal Tiddlywinks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 2. Place the board flat across the empty box. Each player has six small counters and one big one. A counter is flipped towards the target board which is mostly green but also a slaller white area and a hole in the centre. Each counter can only be flipped once. If you miss the target you score nothing with that counter. If you can get a counter on to the board, score as follows:&lt;br/&gt;Green = 25 points&lt;br/&gt;White = 50 points&lt;br/&gt;In the hole = 100 points.&lt;br/&gt;Play 6 turns each and the one with the best score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 3: Use the Goal board. Stand it up on two supports so that it is vertical. Now take turns to flick a counter through the hole. Each goal scored is recorded. After an agreed time or number of turns, the player with the most goals wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
