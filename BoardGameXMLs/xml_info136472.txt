			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A very simple indie multiplayer simultaneous turn-based base shooting game, if that description makes any sense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a space-version of the age-old &amp;quot;shoot the other player's cannon&amp;quot; game where players took turns choosing fire velocity and angle, trying to fire a cannon ball that, when affected by gravity and wind, would hit the other player's cannon. (This game eventually evolved into &amp;quot;Worms&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Gravitas, players are a small ship in a randomized cluster of planets and fire shots trying to hit the other ships. The shots are naturally affected by the planet's gravities, which sometimes created hilarious shots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
