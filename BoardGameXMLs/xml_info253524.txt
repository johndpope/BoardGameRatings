			<description>In IndieDev, players are independent video game developers who are trying to earn prestige in the game industry by creating and releasing critically acclaimed game projects.  Players will juggle the many aspects of running an independent video game company, including completing side jobs to gain extra income; taking courses to  improve abilities; figuring out how to afford marketing;  investing in marketing in order to increase market visibility. Did the game bomb on release?  Players should make the most of the situation, never giving up.  Did the game earn critical success and sell? Players must take that hard-earned cash and use it productively; otherwise players will end up struggling once again.&lt;br/&gt;Players that work through the multiple challenges effectively will triumph within one of the most challenging but rewarding industries.  The player that earned the most prestige will win this game and of course win at life (Mostly win, they still will devote most of their waking life to their next project).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
