			<description>Mystique Energy is a card game for 2 to 6 players that can be played with a Mystique deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set-up, shuffle the deck and place it face down on the table. Each player then draws a card without showing it to the other players, looks at it, then places it face down before them. This is their &amp;quot;energy card&amp;quot; and can be looked at during play. Each player then draws another card; this is their &amp;quot;playing card&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first two players lay their cards on the table adjacent to one another. Players take turns in counterclockwise order placing their card on the table adjacent to at least two placed cards so that the cards fit into an imaginary hexagonal grid, as shown in the image below:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; _   _   _   _&lt;br/&gt;| |_| |_| |_| | &lt;br/&gt;|_| |_| |_| |_|&lt;br/&gt;| |_| |_| |_| |&lt;br/&gt;|_| |_| |_| |_|&lt;br/&gt;| |_| |_| |_| |&lt;br/&gt;|_| |_| |_| |_|&lt;br/&gt;| |_| |_| |_| |&lt;br/&gt;|_| |_| |_| |_|&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After placing the card, the player draws another card from the deck (if possible) which becomes their new &amp;quot;playing card&amp;quot;. The game ends when the last card has been placed on the table, and players then score as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Each player counts the number of cards of the largest connected group of the color of his &amp;quot;energy card&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Each player counts the number of cards of the largest connected group of the suit of his &amp;quot;energy card&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Each player counts the number of cards of the largest connected group of the number of his &amp;quot;energy card&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, each player multiplies these three values. The player with the lowest value wins. In case of a tie, the player among those tied who played his final card first wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
