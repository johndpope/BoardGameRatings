			<description>Publisher Blurb:  &lt;br/&gt;Strength In Numbers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From street gangs to armies, through political and religious groups, to businesses all the way up to multinational corporations, organizations feature prominently in many adventures. They can be tough to get a handle on, though. Juggling lots of people and resources can leave you feeling like &amp;quot;GM&amp;quot; stands for &amp;quot;General Manager,&amp;quot; not &amp;quot;Game Master&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Boardroom and Curia comes to the rescue with a simple-but-effective framework for defining organizations for use in adventures. Its stats block offers a way to write up a group in much the same way you would a city (compare GURPS City Stats), an army (see GURPS Mass Combat), or a spaceship (as in GURPS Spaceships). At a glance, you'll know just how powerful they are and how quickly they can respond, and have a concrete idea of what that means in terms of skill levels, point values, or dollars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boardroom and Curia also includes a full chapter on how to use these stats when the PCs work for or against an organization &amp;ndash; or decide to found one! Rounding it out are seven detailed examples suited to a variety of tech levels and genres: three real-world groups (the Medici bank, the Provisional IRA, and M&amp;eacute;decins Sans Fronti&amp;egrave;res), two that support existing GURPS settings (Biotech Euphrates for Transhuman Space and the Raiders of the Black Void for GURPS Cabal), the sinister Cold War conspiracy of Dr. Zynfami, and a superhero alliance (the Mid-City Defenders).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stop being confused. Start getting organized!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
