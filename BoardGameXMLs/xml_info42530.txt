			<description>Gold Rausch is a card game, using some game mechanic known from the game &amp;quot;Memory&amp;quot;. It's played with 2 to 4 players and each player incarnates a gold seeker. This gold seeker is represented by a gold seeker card laid-out in front of each player. The players get a tool card and a whiskey card as well. These card are placed left and right besides the gold seeker card with the backside up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the middle of the table you can find the river, where to search the gold. This is shown by river cards, which are laid-out in 2 rows with 5 cards each. You can see the river, but not the gold printed on the other side of the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If it is your turn, you have to turn a around a river card. If it shows gold nuggets you have to find the tools printed on the card. For that you turn around the cards which are next to the gold seekers. If you turn around the right tools you get the river card with the nuggets. If you do wrong your turn ends. After that a new river card is placed in the middle. If you turn around a river card showing gold teeth you don't have to find tools, but whiskey bottles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is getting harder, because every time a player shows a wrong tool, all players with a open tool card change this card with another player, so that the tools are now located somewhere else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If all river cards with gold are used the game ends and the player with the most gold nuggets and gold teeth win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
