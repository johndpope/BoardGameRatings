			<description>A One-Round Adventure Packet for 9th Level Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the rise of the Captain&amp;rsquo;s Alliance and the attack lead upon Stormreach by one of their leaders, the Ebon Siren, the fortunes of the city have turned decided sour. The foul weather continues to lash the city walls and churn the sea. Piracy prevents nearly all shipments from Khorvaire from reaching Stormreach. Supplies are in short supply and already food grows scarce. The citizens are nearly prisoners within the city; trapped with the twin specters of plague and starvation beginning to loom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If Stormreach is to survive that the factions might use it as a base from which to explore Xen&amp;rsquo;drik and control the prophecy, decisive action is needed. The factions have exercised the tenuous ties forged during the night of Shargon&amp;rsquo;s Strike (EXP-05: Shargon's Rage) and decided is time to act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
