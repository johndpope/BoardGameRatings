							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Kane &amp;amp; Lynch: Dead Men is a cooperative third-person shooter developed by IO Interactive and published by Eidos Interactive for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC. The mobile phone version is developed by Kiloo and published by Eidos Mobile. While the game itself wasn't received with critical acclaim, a film adaptation is currently in pre-production.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In campaign mode the player takes the role of Kane. The player is able to play through 16 stages with Lynch by his side, at times accompanied by other hired mercenaries. Co-op mode is available in which the second player will assume the role of Lynch. Though almost identical to Kane's style of gameplay, Lynch has short bursts of aggression in which nearly all AI characters are police, some sporting an animal's head. Lynch carries a shotgun and a revolver as side arm, while Kane carries an assault rifle and standard pistol, though it is possible to swap weapons. Additional weapons such as grenades, sniper rifles and carbines can be picked up which can also be swapped between allies. The player can take cover by standing next to a wall, and can blindfire. While having hired mercenaries, the player can issue orders such as follow, move to a specific position, or attack&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Kane &amp;amp; Lynch&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
