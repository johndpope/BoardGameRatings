			<description>A History of the Roleplaying Game Industry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Mongoose Publishing website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compiled over many years from hundreds of interviews and research projects, this book is a history of the roleplaying game industry, and forms the most complete record of all the games, companies and talented individuals that have propelled roleplaying games to where they are today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than being a simple, linear history, this book takes a unique perspective on the roleplaying industry. Reflecting that it is the creation of thousands of talented individuals and scores of talented companies, this book instead devotes individual sections to describing the histories and products of almost 60 different companies that have published roleplaying games from 1974 to the present day. The companies are laid out in a chronology based on when each began publishing in the roleplaying field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designers &amp;amp; Dragons comes in a quality black leather finish, ensuring its collectibility for years to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
