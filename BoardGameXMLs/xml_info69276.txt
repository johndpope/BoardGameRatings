			<description>The game where you win if you tag along the longest, but do the least amount of work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Vem vill bli byr&amp;aring;krat?&amp;quot; (Who wants to be a bureaucrat?) is a fairly simple card game. Your goal is to get rid of cards by collecting sets. The game itself is quite humorous, since all cards are actual excuses (as to why a certain case seems to have stranded, for example) from real bureaucrats (and others) in Sweden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will also co&amp;ouml;perate slightly; a player can &amp;quot;join in&amp;quot; when someone else gets rid of a case. But the goal in the game - as well as in real life bureaucracy - is to get rid of all the cases, without actually doing any amount of work towards them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
