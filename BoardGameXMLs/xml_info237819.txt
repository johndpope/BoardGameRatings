			<description>XOXO Droplets A massive dating sim about a humorously jerky young lady and her mission to woo one of six obnoxious guys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story begins when our nameable protagonist finally transfers into the boarding school of her dreams at the start of her junior year in high school. It would be perfect if it wasn't for that little catch attached to her enrollment: her parents will only let her keep attending the school if she doesn't make everyone there hate her, like she always does.&lt;br/&gt;Do your best to show just enough interest in the other losers around to appease the folks while still having time to chase after all the attractive guys in the MC's afterschool group, which just so happens to be a group for chronically unfriendable people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;XOXO Droplets is aiming to have a free-to-play version and a commercial version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free Version Features:&lt;br/&gt; - 3 extremely distinct jerk main boyfriend options: Everett Gray, Nate Lawson, and Shiloh Fields&lt;br/&gt; - 6 minor clique boyfriend options, each with a bonus effect that makes the game easier&lt;br/&gt; - 6 side characters who'll be your buddies&lt;br/&gt; - An in-game phone to call a guy up and arrange a date at one of several different locations&lt;br/&gt; - The option to break up with your bf and start dating someone else, if you feel like it&lt;br/&gt; - A variety of methods to manage your Reputation with the unimportant students&lt;br/&gt; - Part-time jobs, stores to visit, useful items, optional mini-games&lt;br/&gt; - Over 120,00 words.
