			<description>Propaganda Pamphlet adventure for Weird War Two dual statted for D20 levels 3rd-4th.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A military strike on a factory. A non-supernatural adventure with weird tech. Deep in the Bavarian mountains, Nazi scientists have developed a top-secret serum designed to help them in their quest to create a pure Aryan race. Code-named Uberunter, the serum is lethal to all but those whose genetic structure is suitably Aryan. Is this serum designed only for an SS rite of passage, or do the Nazis have darker designs for Uberunter? The Allies need a sample of this deadly drug. The spy network on the continent has learned that doses of Uberunter have been sent to a Danish syringe manufacturer in Denmark named Tor Anders. This represents the Allies' best chance for obtaining a sample. All that is now needed are volunteers to go behind enemy lines and find a way to get it. Something is rotten in Denmark and it isn't just fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for the Weird War Two: Crusade for Europe RPG system  but also contains conversions for the d20 SRD system. They can also be used for any WWII-themed game system. Each is 16-page pamphlet containing everything a GM needs to run a single-session adventure. They also include a variety of new equipment, monsters, and technology for the WW2:CFE game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
