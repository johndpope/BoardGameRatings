							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Treasure (in the Canadian Rockies)</name>
									
			<description>Each player has a team of three figures, two adventurers and one guide. The guide is used to collect &amp;quot;Grub Stake&amp;quot; cards which allow you to climb the mountain and get the treasure. Your adventurers are used to climb for the gold and to delay other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is interesting in that it has a molded plastic wall which must be climbed. The square 'Grub Stake' cards are placed into slots on the wall to allow a players figure to ascend the mountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is by roll of two dice which may be split amongst any of your three figures. The pieces move in a straight line only... no turns are allowed during a move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a &amp;quot;Bear&amp;quot; card is discovered while exploring, it can be used to send an opponent back to start or delay him while he's climbing for treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is entirely dependent on the roll of the dice and the cards gained through random draw. Nevertheless, it's a fun little race game with a 3D board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
