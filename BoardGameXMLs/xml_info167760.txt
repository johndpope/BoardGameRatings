			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silhouette is an atmospheric two player local browser game. One player is the victim trying to escape from the mansion, the other player is the killer, trying to hack to death the first player. The game is dark and has haunting music. The game ramps up the tension by reducing the amount of play time each player has to play when the two players get close and introducing the sound of a heart beat that quickens as they approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
