			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Alpha Apollo Cluster. In this system of planets and moons the Apollo Confederation rules as a utopia of civilization and technology. The Grand Council, made up of 12 people, reign supreme as the overlords of the Confederation and all Apolloites who live under their control. Through the Council the confederation has engulfed and terraformed twelve diffrent planets and twenty four diffrent moons. New and improved Star Drives allow space craft to travel to these planet systems in mere hour instead of weeks. The Confederation is at its Peak in both Technology and Public Happiness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, times are beginning to change. With several Grand Generals abandoning their oaths the Apollo Confederation Troopers, Fleet, and Military in general has split apart. Fifty percent of the once proud military strength has been severed in a suprise attack leaving the remaining military wounded. Planets are at war to be reclaimed by the Confederation as Rebel forces seet to &amp;quot;liberate&amp;quot; them. Gangs now begin to rise to power as they seek both profits and power from the wars of the others. Pirates seek to control the whole of space. And Mercenary Corporations sell their survices to the highest bidders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Alpha Apollo Confederation. Home to the dystopia that is the Apollo Confederation. Steel yourself, times are tough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Core Rulebook has everything needed to learn and begin playing Mecropoverse (Meh-crop-o-verse): The Futuristic Role-Playing Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
