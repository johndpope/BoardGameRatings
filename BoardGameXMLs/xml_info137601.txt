			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crusher Castle II is the sequel to Crusher.  It features similar gameplay to the original, except that it has been re-themed to that of a haunted castle that is filled with ghosts and requires candles in place of the square monsters and the oxygen requirement of the previous game.  There are no unmovable boxes and the rooms are larger, though the 5x5 grid still exists.&lt;br/&gt;The player must accumulate 10,000 points before pursuing the objectives, which include finding characters and items spread throughout the castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
