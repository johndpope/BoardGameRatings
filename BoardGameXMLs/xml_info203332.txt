			<description>This 1941 game published by Clover Games Inc. consists of 48 triangular tiles bearing different combinations of six colors on each of their three sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules say to place all the tiles face down in the center of the table. Each player initially draws six. Players then in turn draw from one to three triangles each turn until one player can form a hexagon in which all six triangles match colors on each adjoining side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These triangles are set aside. The player who created the hexagon must then place twice the number of tiles he drew above his initial six back into the center and set aside the remainder as out of the game. Each other player returns all tiles to the center, and all players draw new hands of six and start again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until not enough tiles are left in the center for any player to complete a hexagon, at which point the player with the most hexagons wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
