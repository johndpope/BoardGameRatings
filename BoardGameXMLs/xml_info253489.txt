			<description>Something has gone very wrong with the world!  Animals have been separated from the places they belong - can you help put them back?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the card game Face to Face, players work to match animal halves and return them to their respective habitats.  The game contains 4 different habitats (arctic, jungle, savannah, and pasture); each habitat has 4 different animals available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with two shuffled decks of cards - &amp;quot;Place&amp;quot; cards and &amp;quot;Face&amp;quot; cards.  These are placed where all players can reach them.  The player who has had the most exotic pet goes first.  On his/her turn, each player can select a maximum of 2 of the following actions:  (1) take a card from either deck; (2) put a card down; (3) trade a card with another player; (4) discard a card; or (5) pass.  Players' hands may not exceed 7 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players get points for the matched pairs they place down on the animals' correct habitats.  First player to 10 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
