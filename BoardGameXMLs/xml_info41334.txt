							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scary Tales: Snow White vs. The Giant</name>
									
			<description>Snow White vs. The Giant is the second game in the Scary Tales series of two-player games pitting common fairy tale characters against each other. Here's more about the two characters in this game from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Fee, Fi, Fo, Fum...you don't want to mess with this chum. The Giant can crush his foes with his enormous strength, and he has his Magic Hen on his side, as well. But sly Snow White is no longer her sweet self, and she has some tricks up her sleeve, including the assistance of her Seven Dwarfs. Will the kingdom thrive under the rule of either of these challengers? A battle of enormous proportions awaits!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting for Scary Tales is a kingdom, where a battle awaits as the king has died, leaving no heir. While the enchanted forest is feared and the castle is covered in dark clouds, corruption has affected the town and only those with the utmost abilities in Strength, Wisdom, Magic and Luck will be able to collect enough relics from the stories of long ago to prove themselves worthy of being the new leader. The challengers are sharp, indomitable, and devious - and with each match-up, it is uncertain who will win the crown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character comes with its own unique ability which may be used once per game and a color coded set of dice. A set of power cards and fortune cards, a fairy card and a die associated with said fairy comprise the contents of the game. To win, a player needs to obtain seven points worth of relics, and hold on to them until the beginning of their next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
