							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pima Indian Stick Game</name>
									
			<description>This stick game is a traditional game of the Pima Indians of the southwestern part of the US. The 4 sticks each have a pattern indicating a movement option around the track, which is a square with 4 &amp;quot;spaces&amp;quot; on each side. The sticks are cast in the air, and the way they fall determines which movement options the player has for that turn. Basic general rules about movement add some strategy to the order in which these movement options are taken. The first player to go around the track 3 times is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
