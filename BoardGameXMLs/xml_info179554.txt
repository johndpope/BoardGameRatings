			<description>Cloud Knows is a shape-recognizing puzzle game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each game, one plays the role of Cloud while others play the role of Wind. Cloud has to express the answer to the Winds, but can give hints only through the outline silhouette by gathering the parts of cloud. On the other side, all the Winds can do is take turns providing cloud cards to the Cloud player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So this game is a big quiz consisting of many little sequential quizzes: Winds first guessing which card Cloud needs to piece together the answer, then trying to figure out what the answer actually is. The Wind who finds out the answer receives the same points as Cloud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let's challenge your imaginations!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
