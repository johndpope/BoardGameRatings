							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle Nations Outpost</name>
									
			<description>A deck building card game based on the Battle Nations Video Game. Each player controls their own outpost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets his own small Imperial Basic Deck.  All cards in this deck have 2 basic Traits: Build and Fight. Build is used to recruit units, characters, and buildings. Fight is used to defeat threats. Besides the Build and Fight Traits, cards also have additional abilities including:  Draw, Store, Replace, Heal or Repair, Gain VP, and modifiers that increase their traits or the traits of other cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players also share three Common Decks:&lt;br/&gt;Threat Deck (Missions and Invasions)&lt;br/&gt;Building Deck&lt;br/&gt;Unit Deck (Units and Characters)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-   Each player shuffles their Basic Deck and draws 5 cards. &lt;br/&gt;-   Shuffle the 3 common decks. All decks are face-down. &lt;br/&gt;-   Place the top 4 cards of the Threat Deck face-up in a line in the middle of the table.  These 4 cards are known as the Threat Spread. There must always be 4 cards in the Threat Spread. &lt;br/&gt;-   Similarly make spreads for the Building and Unit Decks.  &lt;br/&gt;-   As play proceeds each player will have a modified Basic Deck, a hand of 5 cards, their discard pile, a victory pile (defeated Threats), and a storage pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns with each turn comprising two phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Action Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Play cards from your hand (played cards are put in your discard).&lt;br/&gt;-   Use Build points to recruit buildings, units, and characters from the Building and Unit Spreads.  The cost of a card in build points is its Recruitment Cost (RC).  When a card is recruited, place it in your discard pile. &lt;br/&gt;-   Use Fight points to defeat threats from the Threat Spread. The cost to defeat a threat in fight points is its Threat Value (TV).  Place defeated Threats into your victory pile.  &lt;br/&gt;-   At the end of the phase discard all un-played cards from your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  Draw Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Draw 6 cards from your deck to form your hand for next turn. &lt;br/&gt;-   If you have no cards left in your deck, shuffle your discard and draw from it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory tokens are earned by playing certain cards. Place VT into your Victory Pile along with defeated Threat cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends at the end of the turn any common deck is used up. &lt;br/&gt;Add up your VT (Victory Tokens) plus the TV (Threat Value) of all Threat cards in your victory pile, deck, hand, and discards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most victory points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
