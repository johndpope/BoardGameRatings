			<description>Shien's Revenge is an action game released for the Super Famicom (SNES) in 1994. It is also known in Japan as -Shien- the Blade Chaser 紫炎～ザ・ブレイドチェイサー (Shien ze Bureido Cheeisaa). It was the first video game designed by the famous manga and anime artist Go Nagai.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shien and Aska are a pair of highly-skilled ninja fighting in a bloody war. After defeating hundreds of enemies, monsters suddenly appear from the Time Gate and kidnap Aska. The mastermind is a mysterious force known only as the Undertaker. Shien must now travel through the Time Gate to defeat this unknown evil and rescue his girlfriend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shien's Revenge is played from a first-person viewpoint as the player aims a cursor at enemies to either throw shurikens or slash with a kunai dagger. There are six long levels, each with scaling bosses that nearly fill the screen. A set of candles indicates the Shien's life meter. Power-ups such as rapid fire and magic scrolls can be picked up by defeating enemies; the use of scrolls produces a powerful attack that damages everything on the screen. The game uses the SNES Mouse or a light gun as optional controllers and includes a password save option which allows players to continue their journey at a later time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Shien's Revenge&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
