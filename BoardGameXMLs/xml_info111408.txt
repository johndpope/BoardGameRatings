							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Call Me Capable</name>
									
			<description>Call Me Capable is an educational board game that helps students understand disabilities, as well as to help them learn to respect and empathize with persons with disabilities. It stimulates players to focus on the capabilities of people living with disabilities. The game is designed primarily for educating students who are not disabled, although disabled students enjoy playing immensely. The game has two sets of cards, one for elementary students, and one for middle and high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move around the board picking cards and discussing the questions posed on the cards. Emotion cards ask players how they would feel if they interacted with people with disabilities or had to live with a specific disability. Experience cards ask players to discuss the practical aspects of living with various disabilities. Imagination cards ask players to imagine situations in which the player has a disability or wants to help a person with a disability. Challenge cards are multiple choice questions that add to the players&amp;rsquo; knowledge about specific disabilities, ways for disabled people to improve their lives, and famous people with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Call Me Capable was originally developed by Carol Leish, who sustained disabilities from an auto accident when she was a young child. The game gives a unique insight into both the limitations and possibilities of living with disabilities. Most of all, the game reflects Carol&amp;rsquo;s philosophy of focusing on the capabilities of herself and other disabled people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
