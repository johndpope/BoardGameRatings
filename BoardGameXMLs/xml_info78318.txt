							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Actua Ice Hockey 2</name>
									
			<description>In 1999, Gremlin reworked the engine for better gameplay, graphics, Direct3D support and club teams, and Actua Ice Hockey 2 was released. Actua Ice Hockey 2 was originally intended to be Fox Sports Hockey and was being developed by Gremlin for Fox Interactive, who had obtained an NHL license. Just over half way through development, Fox pulled out taking the NHL license with it. Above the objections of some of the developers, development of the game continued. All references to NHL were changed to GHL ( Gremlin Hockey League ), all player names were modified by substituting vowels (Svoboda became Svaboda, for instance), player faces were randomized and a whole new front-end was developed. The game flopped, and as Gremlin was acquired by then Infogrames (now Atari), no further titles were developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actua_Ice_Hockey_2,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actua_Ice_Hockey_2,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
