							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">WWII TANKS</name>
									
			<description>WWII TANKS is a fun, fast-paced card game where players try to match WWII AFVs presented to look like wargame counters to make pairs. Make your pairs the quickest and win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players choose to draw cards from the deck or take the discard pile, make pairs, discard and pass the turn. Each vehicle  appears on three different cards. Each card has two different AFVs. Easy enough for children to play and elegant enough for adults to enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Able to stand on its own as a simple game, WWII TANKS is also a perfect vehicle [pun intended] presented in a simple format to introduce and expose others to the wonderful world of wargaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The artwork is gorgeous. Makes a great introductory game for your non-gamer friends as well!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the rules fit on one card. A game takes about 15-30 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
