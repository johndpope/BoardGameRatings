			<description>Entourer is played on a hexagonal board divided into 217 smaller circles or hexagons, nine on each side of the board.  A kind of spinner is used to determine how many pieces a player may use in a given turn, zero through four.  The game can be played with two to ten players, each with thirty-six pieces of his own color, whether playing individually or in partnership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For every turn, a player spins, then places that many of his pieces on the board, with the goal of surrounding an opponent&amp;rsquo;s pieces completely.  This is called an &amp;ldquo;entourer&amp;rdquo; and the surrounding player must then remove all of his opponent&amp;rsquo;s pieces and replace them with his own.  If an entourer is caused by more than one player, they then take turns removing and replacing their opponent&amp;rsquo;s captured pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At any time during the game, players may barter with each other to regain their lost pieces.  The first player to have all of his pieces on the board wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
