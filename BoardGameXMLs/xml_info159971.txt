			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;ビバニク (Viva Niku) in English means &amp;quot;Viva Meat&amp;quot;. Viva Niku is a card game with a theme of an eating race in a grilled-meat party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a grilled-meat party in Japan, they sometimes have a yakiniku bugyou (grilled-meat governor) who annoys everyone else by intervening in everything about grilling meat, such as when this meat should be turned over or lifted from the plate, who should eat that meat. Sometimes the Governor gets furious at you if you have slightly overgrilled meat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To reflect the situation, this game favors the Governor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card has a big effect and a small effect such as &amp;quot;Gain 400 kcal/Gain 100 kcal&amp;quot;. Each round, the opening player plays a card, saying &amp;quot;big&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;small&amp;quot;. Then in clockwise, the other players must play the same card and declare &amp;quot;big&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;small&amp;quot; if they have, or pass if they don't. Small effects are granted to all players who declared &amp;quot;small&amp;quot;, but the big effect only goes to one of the players who declared &amp;quot;big&amp;quot;, and if the Governor is involved, it's the Governor that grabs the big effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone else tends to be worried about the Governor's hand. Be cautious until you manage to take over the Goverment's position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player gains total of 2500 kcal, and the player with the most calories wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first edition of Viva Niku is labeled for 3-5 players, while the second edition is for 4-7 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's summary&lt;br/&gt;Tonight, it's &amp;quot;The Day of Meat&amp;quot; for a family. Now, it is good to eat meat! Steal! The desire to follow! &lt;br/&gt;However, I must suggesting a happy &amp;quot;mother of grilled meat magistrate&amp;quot; because noisy when lust for ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of all the people who eat a lot of meat, the player who took the most calories is the winner. Not just lucky, the aim of the game is to win by psychological methods. It is more pleasant with more players in many cases. And ending within 30 minutes with many players, please enjoy the chance to play again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on irregular trick-taking systems such as Witch's Brew. The designer added card-drafting and stronger elements of competition between players. However, the rules are still simple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's summary&lt;br/&gt;焼肉をします。一番たくさん食べたプレイヤーが勝ちます。&lt;br/&gt;焼肉奉行に振り回されながらもトング片手に肉を食べる、癖のあるバッティング・ドラフトゲームです。&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
