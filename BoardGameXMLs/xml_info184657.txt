			<description>Discernment - A Role-Playing Game of Grasping After the Truth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discernment is a role-playing game in which a Subject faces numerous challenges in diverse settings while a panel of Scholars attempt to discern the Subject&amp;rsquo;s true nature. It must be kept in mind that there are three layers of reality and fiction operating in this game. The three levels are noted throughout the game by the following icons: The First Level is the reality: a group of people who have come together to play a game of Discernment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Second Level encompasses the fictional roles of Scholars who seek to discern a Subject&amp;rsquo;s Soul Quality, and a Subject who is held in such a manner that his perceptions and memories are completely at the whim of the Scholars.  The Third Level is the fictional roles and Scenarios that the Scholars impose upon the Subject in order to test his reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
