			<description>This here is the story of the most famous leprechaun of all, Roy G. McBiv. McBiv lives in the rocky hills of Vibgyor and is infatuated with beautiful rainbows. In fact, he dreams of owning his own one day, and is in constant search for all the rainbow colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;McBiv is growing old though... he no longer has that snap to his stature or that whistle in his stride. His cane is wobbly and his vest is tattered. This being so, he has enlisted the help of young leprechauns, like yourself, to collect these colors and complete his dream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can make use of McBiv's magical items along your quest, like his trusty hat or his durable buckets, but don't be irresponsible when it comes to finding those rare colors. In the end, only the first lucky leprechaun to collect these colors will win McBiv&amp;rsquo;s favor and a portion of his gold!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shenanigans is a leprechaun themed card game where players try to collect sets of colored cards.  Each card is assigned a specific color and action.  Using a rainbow color range, the number of cards available for each color diminishes as you go from red to violet (red being the most common and violet being the rarest).  Players must play the action of one card on their turn, balancing the need to keep rare colored cards with the need to use the abilities those cards possess when played.  The rarer a color is, the more powerful its action will typically be.  When a player collects a set of cards, they call &amp;ldquo;Shenanigans&amp;rdquo; and score a point.  The first player to call &amp;ldquo;Shenanigans&amp;rdquo; three times wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
