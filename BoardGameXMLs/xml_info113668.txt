							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War 3010: The Revolution</name>
									
			<description>After winning the war in the year 2410, humanity was dominated by an intergalactic menace known as the Kyllen since the year 2610. In order to save humanity, the player must command a battle fleet - which was seized from the Kyllens by a group of human slaves. A space armada can be built between levels upgrading the vessels with the newest weapons and gears. The game uses the same strategy game feel as its prequel; War 2410. Passwords allow players to play various mini-games (i.e., chess and checkers) in addition to restoring their progress in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;War 3010: The Revolution&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
