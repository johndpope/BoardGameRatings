							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Unstable Crane Game</name>
									
			<description>Crane...Claw...Rip-Off...Thief...it is known by many names throughout history, but the infamous game is still the same in concept: insert cash, use a joystick/buttons to move a metal hand or claw mechanism, then press another button to drop it to see if you snag a prize! Sadly, more times than not, that shiny new toy slips out of the fingers, or misses completely, leading the victim to try insert more cash and repeat these steps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Unstable Crane Game is an up to 4-player, simultaneous rendition of this traditional arcade game, where the players each place their &amp;quot;claw tokens&amp;quot; over the various prizes on the table and wait to see if they snag it. Each round, the players flip the top cards of their Player decks, and either get to move their claw, drop their target, or claim their prize according to their card. The first player to achieve a Prize collection worth at least 10 points will be declared the winner! Good luck...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Notes*&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. There are 3 kinds of cards in each player's deck for simulating their claw's behavior: &amp;quot;Not Yet&amp;quot; (they still have time and may move their claw over another prize.), &amp;quot;Oops! Unlucky!&amp;quot; (their claw snagged a prize, but dropped it while attempting to lift or carry it.), or &amp;quot;You Got It!&amp;quot;(the player's claw successfully claimed a Prize.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Multiple players can try for the same prize. However, since the actions determined by each player flipping the card of their Player Deck occur at roughly the same time, should multiple players draw their &amp;quot;You got it&amp;quot; card in the same round and be over the same prize, their claws instead interfere with each other and play resumes as if they'd dropped the prize instead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. &amp;quot;Set collection&amp;quot; is also used lightly in this game. Should a player claim at each 3 prizes that share a type, that player is considered an &amp;quot;enthusiast&amp;quot; and each prize of that type in their collection is worth an additional point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
