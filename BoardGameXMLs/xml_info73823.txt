			<description>&amp;quot; with user comments&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Donkey Kong (ドンキーコング)  is a platform game developed in 1994 by Nintendo  for the Game Boy handheld video game system, which also contains puzzle elements. Donkey Kong is loosely based on the 1981 arcade game of the same name and its sequel Donkey Kong Jr. The game is also known as Game Boy Donkey Kong (as seen in the title screen) and also Donkey Kong '94 (the working title before release) to differentiate it from the 1981 arcade game. Like in the original arcade and NES version, the player takes control of Mario  and must rescue Pauline from Donkey Kong (who are both given updated character designs for this game). Donkey Kong Jr. also makes a guest appearance in the game on some levels, helping his father hinder Mario's progress. This was the first Game Boy title designed with enhanced features when played on the Super Game Boy. These enhanced features prominently feature barrels.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Donkey_Kong_(Game_Boy),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
