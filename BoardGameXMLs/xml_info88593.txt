			<description>Author Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Otherkind: a fantasy roleplaying game by Vincent Baker, players are dwarves, elves, orcs, and trolls who are charged with gathering and guarding &amp;quot;Numina&amp;quot;, ancient and sacred places and objects that are infused with the spirit of life, from the destructive iron-wielding humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is rules-light and uses a &amp;quot;Fortune in the Middle&amp;quot; mechanic. When resolving conflicts players have to choose which dice to assign to narration (whether the player or GM describes what happened), motion (success at achieving goals), life (whether the PC hurt anyone), and safety (whether the PC is hurt).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
