							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">There Might Be No Christmas</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Santa's presents are gone! We need them back tonight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your guests will play the roles of various inhabitants of the North Pole, including elves, reindeer, snowmen, and other creatures from Christmas folklore. Santa Claus has summoned everyone to his workshop. The normally jolly old man has a stern look on his bearded face as he solemnly tells us that his workshop has been broken into and his magic sack of Christmas presents has been stolen! Without the sack, there can be no Christmas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
