			<description>This game's box is an incredible German box-set that looks like a modernist piece of furniture.&lt;br/&gt;The main game is a cycling board game but the box also contains a rowing and horse racing game.&lt;br/&gt;The components / pieces that you play with (cyclists, horses and row boats) are made from metal.&lt;br/&gt;Up to 6 players can take part and they can bet on the outcome of the race(s).&lt;br/&gt;The board measures 40 x 20 cms (it is not that small after all) and it is just a 50-square-long track without any particular indication on it, except for the arrow that tells us that the riders will move clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both the cyclists depicted on the board and the tin figurines included in the game have an unmistakable XIXth century look.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, while the riders on the board look like racing cyclists, the tin figurines rather look like tourists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are very simple. This is a betting game in which any number of players can take part. Players do not manage a particular rider but just bet on the outcome of the race. Players must agree upon the numbers of laps, and cyclists move according to the throw of dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During their turn every player can move any cyclists since it is unknown who placed bets on which rider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a way this has similar mechanics like games as like Heimlich &amp;amp; Co. (hidden identity) and Reiner Knizia's classic horse racing game Winner's Circle (published by Alea) which also featured players making hidden bets during a race. &lt;br/&gt;This is remarkable for an antique game from the early 20th century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the race is over and the riders have finished the races the players reveal their bets and he who placed the most accurate bets wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
