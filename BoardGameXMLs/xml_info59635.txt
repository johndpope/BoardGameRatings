			<description>Cha-Du-Ke is a card game of skill and luck, using a specialized deck of cards.  The cards in the deck include tens, jacks, queens, kings, and aces, as well as &amp;quot;Cha-Du-Ke&amp;quot; cards that function as a kind of &amp;quot;wild card&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Cha-Du-Ke, players place bets, with the highest hand winning.  A hand containing 2 Cha-Du-Ke cards is an automatic win, with any 3 of a kind and any straight being the second and third highest hands, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues over multiple hands until a previously agreed upon point total or number of hands has been played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
