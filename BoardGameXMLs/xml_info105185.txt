			<description>In the popular Japanese TV show Run for Money Tousouchuu (逃走中) contestants take the roles of Runners as they try to avoid capture by the Hunters.  Confined to a predesignated area of play, the Runners earn more money for every second that they avoid the Hunters until the game time expires.  Should a Runner choose to surrender before time is up, they can use a pay phone to exit the game and they will receive money equal to the time until they quit.  However, if a Runner is tagged by a Hunter not only are they eliminated from the competition but they also receive ZERO cash.  To make matters more interesting, the Runners are given missions via their cell phones.  Successfully completing a mission may give the Runners more cash or it may prevent more Hunters from entering play.  From start to finish, Tousouchuu is a game of risk vs reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Tousouchuu THE Board Game, 2-5 players assume the role of Runners as they try to earn the most money possible without being caught by a Hunter.  As Missions come up, the Runners have to decide whether or not they will risk participation or if they'd rather hide to avoid being discovered and eliminated.  But unlike the TV show, Missions have an added bonus: Runners who successfully complete a Mission earn powerful Items that will help them avoid capture by the Hunters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the time ticks away and the money adds up, the Hunters continue their patrol.  Once a Runner is spotted by a Hunter, the chase is on!  Escaping the inhumanly fast Hunters will require both luck and endurance.  Run out of either and you will be caught and sent off to Detention.  But even while eliminated, you may find that sometimes even the Hunters are in need of Informants...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, the winner is the Runner with the most earned cash. Will you last until the time line hits zero?  Will you Surrender and walk away with only a portion of the cash?  Or will you get caught by the Hunters and receive absolutely nothing?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tousouchuu THE Board Game features a double-sided game board and time-line for either a Short Game (for beginners) or Exciting Game (for those wanting a challenge).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
