							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Modern: 101 Urban Legends</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern: 101 Urban Legends presents exactly what its title says: 101 snippets of odd, implausible, and sometimes ridiculous modern folklore. The legends presented here are a mix of real world tall tales and inventions of the author, James Maliszewski.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 10-page PDF is intended as a spur to the GM's imagination. It can be used in a variety of different ways. One of the most straightforward is as the basis for an adventure or series of adventures. A d% roll enables the random selection of all but the last of the urban legends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF can also be used to flesh out GM characters in a D20 Modern Roleplaying Game campaign. Randomly rolling a legend gives the GM a strange belief or quirk for his characters. Knowing that, for example, the local bookie thinks bimetallic coins contain tracking devices breathes a little life into him beyond his abilities and physical description. It?s a strange bit of life, to be sure, but then memorable characters are often a bit strange. Likewise, players might use the list of legends to create strange beliefs for their own characters. Even players sometimes need a bit of help in adding flesh to the bones of their characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
