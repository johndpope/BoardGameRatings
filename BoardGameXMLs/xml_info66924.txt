							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shellendrak Manor</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dust swirls across the ornate floor in billowing clouds as the doors to Shellendrak Manor creak open. Musty air fills the cavernous grand gallery, its great staircase beckoning. Grim statues of ancient warriors and empty suits of armour offer impassive greetings. The eyes of fading portraits seem to follow you wherever you go and the sound of shuffling seems both impossibly distant and eerily close. Wasn't that door closed a minute ago? Weren't there three statues along that wall before? Maybe this wasn't such a good idea...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take your players into the dark reaches of horror and insanity with Shellendrak Manor! This multi-genre model set fits happily in many time periods from medieval to modern and everywhere in between! Fully compatible with 1&amp;quot;, 1.5&amp;quot; and gridless game formats, Shellendrak features multiple floor textures, wall textures, hallway textures, multipart chimney, marble columns and a massive grand gallery entrance hall!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complete structure! No more leftover half-inches for 1.5&amp;quot; players, Shelledrak's &amp;quot;footprint&amp;quot; approach to terrain building allows you to construct anything from a small house to a massive mansion with an adaptable, made-to-order rooftop system!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Did someone say &amp;quot;props&amp;quot;? Shellendrak Manor contains over two dozen original props and features unique set dressings to further customize your Manor, including everything from curtains to an iron maiden to an antique roadster! Almost every prop has a variant version as well, over 50 props in all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BRAAAAAAAAINS! In a WorldWorks first Shellendrak also includes the free game, &amp;quot;Zombie Manor&amp;quot;! Not only do you get to build one kick-butt model set but you can throw down our exclusive mini-game for a night of fun with friends and family!
