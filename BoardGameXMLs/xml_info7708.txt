			<description>The players try to form snakes, which are as long as possible. A snake always consists of a head-section, at least one middle-section and a tail-section. The player who has formed the most and longest snakes wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are shuffled and placed face down fan-like on the table. One card is drawn from the &amp;quot;fan&amp;quot; and is placed face-up in the middle of the table. In turn, each player draws a card from the &amp;quot;fan&amp;quot; and tries to match the color with a card in the middle of the table. The card can be turned around to match. If the colors of the two cards match, a snake is started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player draws a card which cannot be placed next to a card or a snake in the middle of the table, this card is then placed on its own in the middle of the table. A card which is drawn from the &amp;quot;fan&amp;quot; can be placed next to a snake to lengthen the snake. A snake can be made longer on both sides. If a head or a tail was already added to the snake, the snake cannot be made longer on that side where the head or tail was placed. A snake without a head or a tail is an incomplete snake. Incomplete snakes remain in the middle of the table until they can be made complete and claimed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complete snake consists of a head-section, a tail-section and at least one middle-section. A complete snake does not need to have all colors. The player who is able to complete a snake by laying down a head or a tail with the matching color next to the &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; side of the snake may pick up the snake from the center of the table and place it directly in front of him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The head and the tail with the rainbow colours are jokers. They may be placed next to every middle-section of a snake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If several incomplete snakes exist in the middle of the table, a player who draws a matching card from the &amp;quot;fan&amp;quot; can combine two incomplete snakes. The player picks up the combined snake and places it directly in front of him. The player is only allowed to combine two incomplete snakes if he uses the card which he just drew from the &amp;quot;fan.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the last card is drawn from the &amp;quot;fan.&amp;quot; If the player with the last card is able to complete a snake, he is allowed to pick up the snake and place it directly in front of him. Now the cards in front of every player are counted. The player who has the most cards wins. If two or more players have the same number of cards the player with the longest snake wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
