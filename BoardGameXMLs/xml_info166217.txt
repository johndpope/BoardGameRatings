			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cogs, Cakes and Swordsticks is a game of steampunk pulp adventure, designed to be played in the comfort of your favourite tea shop with your friends, and requiring nothing more than your imagination, a pen, napkins and a sugar cube (should a six-sided die not be readily forthcoming)*.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This brand spanking new edition combines both the core rulebook and the game's first supplement, Atlantis: City In The Clouds, plus a little something extra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A nice, simple introductory guide to get you playing as quickly as possible (including a short adventure with its own pregenerated characters)&lt;br/&gt;     More details on the setting and rules, including how to create characters of your own and how to run a full game of Cogs, Cakes and Swordsticks (with another, bigger adventure set against the backdrop of the British Museum)&lt;br/&gt;     A closer look at Her Majesty's fantastical flying city HMFSC Atlantis, a marvel of the modern age and the new jewel of the British Empire, which hovers above the Atlantic Ocean like a proud, floating galleon. Well, a gigantic, metal galleon that doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually go anywhere, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure you get the general idea&lt;br/&gt;     A feature-length mystery set aboard The Cog (as Atlantis is known to her inhabitants)&lt;br/&gt;     And, for the first time, a selection of historical trailblazers ready for use in your own adventures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So grab the cake of your choice and a piping hot cup of tea, settle down and allow us to welcome you to the Empire of Steam - an age of marvellous gizmos and mad inventors, Babbage Engines and flying steamships, dashing heroes and femme fatales, and the odd fiendish villain for good measure. In short: a time of exploration, intrigue and high adventure! We&amp;rsquo;re glad you could join us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[*]Although sugar cubes aren't actually cube shaped these days. What ever is the world coming to?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
