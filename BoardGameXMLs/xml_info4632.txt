							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Die Monstermacher</name>
									
			<description>The players must try to stitch together a monster and revive it. You collect body parts from graves, the gallows and from other players warehouses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a nice rule controlling when you can steal from other players. You have a die that moves up or down one number when you perform certain actions. Others can steal from you when the amount of body parts in your warehouse exceeds or is equal to your die number. This balances things out and keeps the players stitching their monster together (using their cards) to keep their warehouses (card supply) from being raided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Art may be too gruesome for the youngest players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
