			<description>Aadu Puli Attam (goat and tiger game) is a strategic, two-player board game. It is a traditional game that has been popular for ages in the southern states of India. In the state of Karnataka it's called Huli gatta and in Andhra Pradesh it is known as Puli Joodam or Puli-Meka.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is asymmetric - one player controls three tigers and the other player controls up to 15 goats. The tigers try to capture all goats, while the goats attempt to encircle the tigers and win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with the goats off the board, and the tigers positioned at the apex and the two inner intersections closest to the apex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns and move along the lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controlling the goats makes the first move by placing a goat in a free intersection. (Goats cannot move until all 15 have been placed on the board.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tiger can either move to an adjacent intersection along a line, or capture a goat by jumping over it just as in Checkers/Draughts. (Unlike goats, tigers can move right from the first turn.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all goats have been captured, or when none of the tigers can move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE:&lt;br/&gt;Only one goat can be captured at a time. The captured goat leaves the board.&lt;br/&gt;A tiger cannot be captured.&lt;br/&gt;Turns alternate between players, with the goats starting off the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment:&lt;br/&gt;Goat: 15 small pieces. &lt;br/&gt;Tiger: 3 big pieces. &lt;br/&gt;Board with lines and 23 Spots for moving Aadu and Pulis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
