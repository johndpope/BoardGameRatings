			<description>Each player commands a small army of units consisting of a knight, two archers, two pikemen, three infantry and four militia. The players choose one of ten maps on which to play. Each map uses a square grid to regulate movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players adjust the counters on each unit to ten strength points. The players then place the units on the map. In turn, each player will move any and all units. When the units are within range of the enemy, they may engage in combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Damage done to the defending unit is determined by the lining up the strength points of the units involved on the Combat Wheel and reading the results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
