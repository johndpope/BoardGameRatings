			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A budget shoot'em up. The action takes place on a single screen (no scrolling, if your plane leaves through a side of the screen it will come back through the other side). The game manual says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You have just seven days to prevent Dr. Destructo from carrying out his evil plans and launching a massive global attack.&lt;br/&gt;   Your mission is to destroy the Dr. Destructo and his island stronghold in just seven days. The buildings and fleet of the Destructo Empire are destroyed from the impact of shot down air and space craft, or by the bomb which is allocated to each player per screen. Each impact will remove a small section of the ship, island or building. When the missing sections amount to a gap through to the base, a leak is created and a water spout is formed. Most objects need three leaks in order to be successfully destroyed.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
