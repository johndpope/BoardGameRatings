							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cleric Reforged</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Classes Reforged line explores each class in depth, amping up the fun and playability of each class. We have attempted to address some of the major criticisms of the class with an effort not to make them simply more powerful, but rather more fun to play in a manner that feels more in line with their concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cleric Reforged&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why is it that clerics are the butt of so many jokes in gaming? No one wants to play the heal-bot, right? But clerics should be so much more than just a support class that exists only to refill other players hit points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our cleric is a true divine conduit! They are the voice, the arm and the will of their gods! Clerics should be able to work miracles in the name of their gods, and their play style should reflect that.  The Cleric Reforged is all that and more. We&amp;rsquo;ve slaughtered some sacred cows and made some significant changes, granting more options to the style of clerics in play. We&amp;rsquo;ve also added a host of new options to how you can channel divine energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New class abilities such as Divine Insight grant flashes of inspiration to your abilities.  Clerics will rely on their domains much more and their domain choices will color their play style to an even greater degree.  New options for channeling give clerics some fun new ways to heal and harm, along with 28 new cleric feats that further expand channeling and the core cleric abilities.  We&amp;rsquo;ve also included favored class bonuses for all the expanded races and give some example cleric builds to illustrate the flexibility of The Cleric Reforged.  This product is 17 pages, and extensively hyperlinked to the d20pfsrd for ease of use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be more than just a heal-bot.  Get reforged!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
