							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Busy World of Richard Scarry: Busiest Shopping Day Ever Game</name>
									
			<description>Match the colors and be the first busy shopper to collect everything on your shopping list!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player selects a shopping list and a shopper playing piece.  24 cardboard grocery item tokens are placed on their matching spaces on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, the player spins the spinner and moves his shopper to the next matching colored space on the gameboard path.  If the player lands on a space next to an item on his shopping list, he takes that item from the gameboard and puts it on his shopping list card.  Bonus moves include a Free Coupon space and spinning on Bananas Gorilla or Sergeant Murphy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get to the checkout space with all the items on his list is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
