							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Facsimile of Death</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Facsimile of Death is meant as an introduction to the world of Interface Zero, as well as to the Fate Core version of the game. There are some firefights, but most of the adventure involves investigation, planning, social navigation, and trying hard not to be betrayed. It&amp;rsquo;s the story of Avery Price, a murder victim with nobody to look into her death &amp;hellip; until the PCs come along.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Facsimile of Death uses a set of extra rules called the Whodunit System. In this adventure, there are four potential murderers, and any one of them could have done the deed. You, the GM, will figure out who the killer is along with the PCs, and the adventure will adapt to their choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the end, though, nothing is ever really what it seems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
