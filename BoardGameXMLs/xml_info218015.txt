			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Most Brilliant Mage is a short CCG-like game for two players that can be played with a standard deck of cards.  In the game, the players are Mages casting spells and summoning the elements to fight for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players cast spells and/or summon elements in an attempt to have the most power in play.  Players are fighting a tug-of-war for points, similar to games like Twilight Struggle, and if a player gets to 3 points, she wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was designed to mimic the more meta-decisions involved in CCGs while being able to be played with just 18 cards.  Strategies like Aggro and Control are present in the game.  There are also options for pre-built decks and drafting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While it does not have the depth of true CCGs, The Most Brilliant Mage is a brain-burner that can scratch that same itch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
