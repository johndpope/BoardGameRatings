			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jumpers NPC 20-Packs are for JMs who need a few &amp;ldquo;extras&amp;rdquo; to populate their jumps.  They are especially useful if you are running a jump off the top of your head or if your players strayed into uncharted territory of a carefully planned adventure and you need a new NPC on short notice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following set of NPC cards were designed to be printed front to back with the main stats and physical description on one side and the character&amp;rsquo;s backstory on the reverse.  They can be used with the perforated printer notecards available at most office supply stores or just printed on plain paper and separated with scissors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Yes, we know this 20 pack actually has 19 cops.  As this is our first release, we&amp;rsquo;re working out some technical issues with our automated publishing solutions.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
