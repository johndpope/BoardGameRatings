							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Top 3: Metropolen</name>
									
			<description>Your task is to put three randomly drawn metropoles in one of five categories in the correct order. You score points for correct guesses - the less your opponents know, the more you'll score!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Top3 - Metropolen was released soon after the N&amp;uuml;rnberg trade fair in 2008 as one of three card games in a new series of trivia card games made by KOSMOS called &amp;quot;Top3&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The categories are so specific that even players who are very much interested in the given topic (like great cities in this case) probably will not know the correct answers. Instead, every player has to do the best guess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
