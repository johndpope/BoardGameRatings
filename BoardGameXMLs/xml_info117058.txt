			<description>This is a horse race simulation board game.  In this game a roll of a D6 is referenced to a chart to determine the movement of each horse.  Each horse has a separate card with its movement chart thereon. The charts have three rows of numbers, each for a different section of the track. Turn order is by lane in the first round and then till the finish, turn order is by leader. Lane changes are permitted only as the very first move of a pawn (horse) on its turn.  The first lane change is allowed as a forward diagonal movement of the pawn.  Additional lane changes in a turn are at a cost of one movement point each,  So, if you have five movement points and make two lane changes as the first two movements of your pawn then you can move four spaces forward along the track. There are areas on the track where lane changes are prohibited.  &lt;br/&gt;   A bit of statistical analysis was made by Cincinnati native Howard Hughes in creating the horse cards.  The horse cards reflect the performance of real horses in that those that excel in sprints fair poorly in long distance races and vice versa.  There is no provision for betting in this game.  The components are somewhat primitive, consisting of; horse movement cards, pawns and coin money all punched from a perforated sheet of card stock.  The box art has a beautiful charcoal drawing of a jockey on his horse making their way to the starting gate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
