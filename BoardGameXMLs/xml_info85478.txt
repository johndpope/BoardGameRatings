			<description>Bella and Bello are completely over the moon! Their friend Isabella has come to visit unexpectedly. And of course they want to give her their best bones. But where on earth have they buried them? Oh yes, under the garden gnome and there, beside the watering can. &lt;br/&gt;Bella and Bello run about tirelessly, burrowing here and digging there...&lt;br/&gt;The one who guides them over the lawn skilfully and is first to dig up the bone for Isabella together with them wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is played with two &amp;quot;dogs&amp;quot;, wooden balls with ears attached to them, which are placed in a box which has several holes in the bottom. Each hole is marked by an item: watering can, a garden gnome, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the standard version of the game, a pile of cards each displaying two items is placed in the middle of the table. The active player takes the box and tries to roll the two dogs in the holes with marked with the items on the top card. If he succeeds, he gets to keep the card. In the meantime, his neighbour is repeatedly rolling a die which has a dog on one side. If he rolls the dog, then the active player's turn is over. The first player to gather three cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the no-dice version all cards are arranged next to each other on the board. On each card, a burrowing chip is placed, face down. Some of these chips show a bone, others do not. When it is a player's turn, the tries to move the dogs into two holes, and then gets to inspect the burrowing chip on the card corresponding to the holes that the dogs have gone in. If the chip shows a bone, he gets to keep it, otherwise it is returned to the card. When there are only eight chips left on the card, the game ends, and the player with the most bones wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
