			<description>&amp;quot;Inertia: Escape Velocity is the spiritual successor to Inertia, a student project out of Southern Methodist University&amp;rsquo;s game development program (known as The Guildhall at SMU), which was awarded the Grand Prize for non-commercial games in the 2011 Indie Game Challenge this past February. With the creators of the original Inertia now part of the development team at Red Fly Studio, a percentage of proceeds from the sale of Inertia: Escape Velocity will be donated to The Guildhall at SMU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highlights of Inertia: Escape Velocity include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Physics-based platformer: employ a unique anti-gravity element to float, glide, and bounce around deep space environments to collect space junk for ship repair and to unlock new planets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Console gameplay on mobile devices: with high-quality graphics, intense and challenging levels, and a unique gameplay mechanic, core gamers will appreciate a console gaming experience on a portable platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Control settings: the game uses on-screen controls for movement, jumping, and gravity control, but players can also opt to use challenging tilt controls that turn the entire device into the controller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inferno levels: for even more of a challenge, players can try their hand at these high-difficulty versions of each level.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
