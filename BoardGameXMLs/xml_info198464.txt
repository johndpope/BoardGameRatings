							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ruckus Ridge VR Party</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ruckus Ridge VR Party is an asymmetric virtual reality party game in which one player, wearing a VR headset, stands in the middle a battle arena randomly strewn with boxes, holding a light gun. Meanwhile, the &amp;quot;couch&amp;quot; players view the arena on a flat 2D screen from an overhead perspective, and their characters move around while hiding under the boxes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features several different level types, each with a different objective for the couch players, such as collecting coins, or reaching the center of the arena, or playing hot potato with a bomb. The couch players must be careful in their actions however, as moving while the VR player is looking in their direction will signal their position and ensure a quick death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a free-play mode as well as a tournament mode, in which players take turns donning the headset over a set number of rounds and try to score the highest total of points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
