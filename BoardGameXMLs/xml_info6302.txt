			<description>Tower Quest is a card game set in a fantasy world.  Players attempt to collect a set of cards to become the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is given a hand of 7 cards at the start, while all the other cards are mixed into a common deck.  One player starts the game by drawing a card from the deck and playing it.  Character cards (those with an icon) are placed face down, while other cards are played face up.  Going clockwise, the next player plays a card of higher value from his or her hand or passes.  The player who drew and played the initial card is the last to decide whether to play a card of higher value or not.  The player who played the highest value card in the pile gains the initial card into his or her collection; all other cards are discarded.  Players replenish their hands after the conclusion of this round and the next round begins with the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has collected a pre-determined set of Character cards (based on their icons), he or she can call an end to the game.  The players tally their scores from the cards in their hand and collection, and add any bonuses (for ending the game, the collected Character cards, etc).  The player with the highest score is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
