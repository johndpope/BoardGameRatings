							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Adventurer&#039;s Option: Strained and Battered</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Torrok shook under the mighty blow. The battles had been raging on all day, and the minotaur he now faced was not the first he'd fought that day - and who knew if it would be the last. He'd never known himself able to push his endurance and resilience to such limits. If he survived only a single night of rest would await him before the battle was rejoined. With grim certainty he knew, come tomorrow, that the strain of today would still bear heavy upon him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When an adventurer is pushed to their limits, there is a price to pay! Add to your games a level of hindrance to a character's health and recovery. Inside this 4e supplement you'll find rules that provide a noticeable in-game impact to a brutal day of action while at the same time not penalizing characters to a degree where they no longer function or become incredibly cautious. Built upon the concepts and rules structures of the base 4e game, it introduces new dimensions of knife-edge play while shying away from explicit injuries, wound tracking and additional game complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will like playing with this product if...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     You want a character's physical condition at the end of the adventuring day to mean something&lt;br/&gt;     You yearn for more grittiness in your game&lt;br/&gt;     You dislike the &amp;quot;1 HP to full&amp;quot; nature of Extended Rest healing&lt;br/&gt;     You enjoy added game intricacy without added complexity&lt;br/&gt;     You are looking for additional rules support that is built upon the systems already in the game for easy integration&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
