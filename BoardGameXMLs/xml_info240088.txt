							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Whatever: A Party Game</name>
									
			<description>Whatever is a party game for normal people who like to get weird occasionally&amp;hellip; often.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disclaimer: This is not your typical party game. Whatever combines adult humor with not super mature activities, and it&amp;rsquo;s fun as hell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of instructions, a spinner, and 3 decks of cards: 75 Challenge/75 Showdown/ 50 Penalty&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you dare to play, and you definitely should, lay the 3 decks of cards facedown on the table. Player with the bushiest brows goes first&amp;hellip; unless there is a player with a butt-chin, then you&amp;rsquo;re up, bud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spin to determine whether you will be completing a Challenge or a Showdown. A Challenge card is a dare that you must complete by yourself. In a Showdown, you will compete against one or more players in the game. If you successfully complete your Challenge or win a Showdown, keep the card. If you&amp;rsquo;re a wimp and opt out of your Challenge or Showdown, you must pick a Penalty card and do that instead. You do not keep the Penalty card, we just need to shame you a little for being a puss. First player to collect 5 cards wins. Sounds easy right? Or so you think! No shame in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
