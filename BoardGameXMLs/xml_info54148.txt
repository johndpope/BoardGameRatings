			<description>From the Publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Misery Bubblegum is a story-telling card game of teen love and heartbreak. With the deck, some friends, and sixty to ninety minutes you can tell a story of sweet, scared, vulnerable people doing their best to reach for acceptance (and maybe love) and avoid rejection and heartbreak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is this a kissing game?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the characters? Hopefully. For the players? Probably not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But yes, unlike some story-telling and roleplaying games, Misery Bubblegum focusses on romance, relationships, uncertainty and humor. There aren't any special rules for combat, car chases, daring escapes and grievous injuries. It's all just stuff you do while trying to impress the girl. If you want a little martial arts to spice up your romance story then Misery Bubblegum has you covered. If you want a little romance to spice up your martial arts story then there are other systems out there that do that better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why is it cool?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you've already got plenty of games ideal for the sweet teen romance genre, what makes Misery Bubblegum stand out? It fits in your pocket and it fits in your life. You can run the game with nothing but the deck of cards ... no pencils, no paper, no markers, no dice. And it runs, from start to finish (creating characters and telling a story) in sixty to ninety minutes. If you want more than that you can, of course, play it again with the same characters. But if you've got a group of friends who are willing to commit to the time to play a typical board-game, but not willing to commit a whole evening (or several evenings) to an epic story game, Misery Bubblegum gives you a way to get your story-juices flowing without asking for more than your group is ready to give.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
