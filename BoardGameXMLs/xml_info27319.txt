			<description>This is a card game by Joe Magic Games. The game is played with two custom decks of playing cards with renaissance art depicting medieval England. Kingdoms are set up on mats that define each player's domain.  Players attempt to manipulate the cards which represent different aspects of the court, including kings, queens, assassins, and spies.  They also manage population, treasury, and war.  &lt;br/&gt;The game includes pawns that indicate level of royalty, and advancement cards like: Longbow, Sanitation, and Chivalry.  Also, mixed in with the cards are events like Corruption, Peasant Revolt, and Black Death. The player who is the current ruler has the ability to tax and forbid other players to perform particular actions.  In this way, that player has more control over events, but also is a bigger target for war and assassination.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who manages to survive two rounds by either having the only living population or being the ruler and only player with cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
