			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The In Harm πs Way: Wild Blue core rules do not allow for player characters to be civilians. It is assumed that most, if not all, players would want their characters to be from military service. However, during playtest, we were surprised that a number of players truly wanted to have civilian characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The justification was that such people would be from the many support positions that a company must have in order to interact with the rest of the world. These positions would range from the expert technicians who fine-tune the jet engines in mercenary fighters to the intelligence and public relations managers that such a company must have to function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, there were player characters who were blatantly not part of the company. These were important characters who would become intimately involved with the operations and missions the company would contract for, including civilian science teams that the mercenaries are hired to protect, and the diplomatic teams requiring escort in hostile territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lastly, this supplement provides the option for creating those individuals who leave the military and spend several years in the civilian sector before realizing the error of their ways and signing up for adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
