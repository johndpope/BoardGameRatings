			<description>In this party game, players compete and cooperate in a variety of familiar situations - including trivia, drawing, and charades.  Unlike other board games of its kind however, players not only compete to win, but must also work together.  Teams move along the board based on the difficulty of the word or trivia question in the chosen category (Think, Act, Draw, and Talk).  The game involves skill, knowledge, strategy, and luck.  The underlying premise of the game is based on the 1950 PhD thesis of Nobel Prize winning economist John Nash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
