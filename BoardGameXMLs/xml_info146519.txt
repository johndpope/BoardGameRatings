			<description>Catalog Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Highly Acclaimed Action Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INVADERS as you have probably already discovered is a great deal of fun, but it is only played on one plane - vertical. ASTEROIDS is more &amp;quot;three dimensional&amp;quot;, but it is concerned with inanimate objects, namely lumps of space rock. With DEFEND you actually feel as if you are piloting the craft. The result is a game with a high addictive content. Your objective is to shoot down a squadron of aggressive enemy ships. If you are skilful or lucky enough to obliterate them all, you have to navigate through a shower of meteorites. If you get through that then you must navigate a tunnel before you are in the clear. You then automatically return to the beginning and begin another orbit, albeit at a somewhat harder level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
