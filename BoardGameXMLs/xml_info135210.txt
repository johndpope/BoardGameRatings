			<description>A set of skirmish rules for 15-28mm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From althistory alternative history wiki-&lt;br/&gt;      In May 1937, King Edward VIII of the United Kingdom married Wallis Simpson. The marriage to Wallis was not recommended by Stanley Baldwin, the British Prime Minister; and Edward refused to abdicate. This marriage left the British government, and most of the people, alienated; and hatred for King Edward and Queen Wallis rose. In January 1938, a protest by Dockyard workers in Liverpool was brutally crushed by the army; and violent clashes began across the country; between the Kings troops and those of several other factions. The British Civil War had begun!&lt;br/&gt; Factions: The outbreak of conflict led several groups to attempt to seize the country or their own personal goals. Major factions included:&lt;br/&gt; ■ The Edwardian Army - Led by King Edward VIII &lt;br/&gt;■ British Union of Fascists - Led by Oswald Mosley, the British Fascisti were aligned with the Edwardian Army&lt;br/&gt; ■ The Georgian Army - Led by Edward's younger brother, George, Duke of Kent. &lt;br/&gt;■ The Anglican League - A large army led by a group of bishops and archbishops, they were aligned with the Georgian Army&lt;br/&gt; ■ The Red Field Army - Made up of disgruntled workers and Spanish Civil War veterans, they sought to turn Britain into a Socialist state based upon Lenin's Russia.&lt;br/&gt; ■ The Scottish, Welsh and Cornish Independence Movements - Groups in Scotland, Wales and even Cornwall who sought to form their own independent nations, they were supported at various times by The Red Field Army and The Anglican League.&lt;br/&gt; ■ The British Empire Independence Movements - Groups of people accross the Empire fought for autonomy and independence.&lt;br/&gt; ■ Foreign Volunteer Units fighting for the major factions. Examples included the AVAC (American Volunteer Army Corps) formed by Joseph Kennedy and the Hanoverian Legion formed by Hermann G&amp;ouml;ring fighting for the Edwardians; the ANZAC Volunteers and the Imperial Volunteers fighting for the Georgians; and the International Revolutionary Corps formed by Leon Trotsky and the People's Soviet Volunteer Army formed by Vyacheslav Molotov fighting for the Socialists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's website -  &lt;br/&gt;     1938 A Very British Civil War has built a considerable fan base dedicated to researching and gaming this world of an alternative 1930's For the first time we have produced a specific set of rules for the period. These are aimed at creating large multi- player battles while retaining the charm and character that has made this project endearing to many wargamers Now with a group of friends, a good curry and a few pints, you have a fast play set of rules that will allow you to storm the defences of Liverpool, raid over the border or lead gallant cavalry charges in the Severn valley. Brigadier 38 as the name implies gives each commander a brigade, where a company is 10 figures, and a battalion of 30-60.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules cover- &lt;br/&gt;   orders, movement, firing, morale and melee, along with a points guide to provide suitable forces for battles and scenarios&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
