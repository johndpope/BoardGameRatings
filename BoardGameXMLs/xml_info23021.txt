			<description>Our story revolves around the horrific murder of Lord Henry Blacksnake, whose body has been found lying next to his severed head, on the floor of the Great Hall of Buckingham Castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As confusion reigns in the darkness, the Night Watch immediately seals off all castle exits and ensures that no one leaves. A fretful night of fear ensues, but fortunately, dawn sees the coincidental arrival of self appointed Witchfinder General Matthew Hopkins, who immediately assumes control of the situation, and, suspecting foul play, calls for an Inquisition of those characters found within the castle walls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those involved, the stakes could not be higher, as Hopkins decrees that the person selected by the others as being the likely murderer, will be immediately taken to the dungeons for a period of relentless torture at the master inquisitor's hands, until they are ready to admit to their guilt.&lt;br/&gt;Hopkins is confident the guilty party will be found, as his tried and tested methods have yet to fail!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
