			<description>This is fastplay set of miniature wargame rules for the battles of the 18th century, primarily the Seven Years War and Austrian War of Succession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Figure scale is 1:50 and battles can be completed in an evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It would appear that the game is likely to be by the same designer as Fusil and Fortress, but this is an assumption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are written for reasonable people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
