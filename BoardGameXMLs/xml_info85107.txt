			<description>&amp;quot;A game of strategy for two to four players.  Compete to make rows of three or more of the same colour.&amp;quot; - box lid.&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 4 racks, one for each player, and 44 oblong cards which each have a line of three spots in combinations of red, yellow, green and blue. Each player takes 3 cards from the face down cards. The first player lays a tile replacing it from the remainder. The next player lays a card alongside one of the long edges of the first card. Further cards are similarly laid alongside either long side of the previously laid cards until completion of 11 cards. Then a second row of cards is laid adjacent to one of four short edges of the end cards starting a parallel row of cards. The game ends when 4 rows of cards are complete. Scoring is by each player announcing how many new rows of 3 or more same coloured dots have been formed by the card laid, horizontal, vertical and diagonal, counting 3 for a row of 3 dots, 4 for a row of 4 dots etc. Diagonal rows count double. When all cards are played the player with the highest score is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
