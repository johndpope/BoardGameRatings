			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rivers and Lakes (Jiang Hu) was contest entry focused on genre redesign.  Character creation involves creating a School, which involves available skills, training, and social position.  Each school also offers training in one of five martial arts styles.  Players distribute points among these various attributes at character creation.  Characters also have additional traits designed by narrative tags.  Conflict resolution is performed by accumulating a pool of Victory Dice, based on their Integrity Attribute.  The dice pool results are compared to an action table to determine outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
