			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Homeless is an RPG about the modern hunter-gatherer. Its tales are that of the unknown, unseen, unwanted and unwashed that struggle through a world not so distant from your own. The rules of the game are all around you, life and what it takes to live when you are on the edge. Encounters in Homeless can be as straight forward as making it to tomorrow and as intricate as the cityscapes within which we live. Living on the streets you are the eyes and the ears of that great urban beast, the City. There is no limit to what you may witness, who you may stumble into or what you may rummage through which best was left lost or forgotten. Who will you be, how did you get there and what will you do to live, thrive and survive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
