							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oppdrag: Misjon</name>
									
			<description>(Translated from the box and homepage)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Christian strategy game with witnessing obligation as its focus!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Oppdrag: Misjon the participants will build missionary bases, upgrade them to congregations and churches around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To be able to build one, one has to have access to resources. As the term strategy hints at, you need to be smart and make a strategic plan deciding where it's favorable to build missionaries, in order to secure the resources you need. One may suddenly be struck by drought catastrophes or a grasshopper invasion, so nothing is predictable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to collect 5000 missionary points, but in addition answer questions from 3 of the information cards you have received during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;33 of the missionary organizations in Norway have written some information about their work and the countries where they evangelize in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is clearly influenced by &amp;quot;The Settlers of Catan&amp;quot;. The basic gameplay with rolling for reaources and using these to build various things is lifted straight off of Settlers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
