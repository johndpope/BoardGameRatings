			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Junk Race you play the driver of a car that is constantly falling apart in the middle of the most important race of your life. Thankfully, this is happening to all the other drivers too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Junk Race is a destruction management racing game for 2-5 players set in a creative, but perhaps mechanically challenged world. Players will face the constant breakage of parts of their cars, and will have to spend their limited Wrench resources between repairs, attacking other players, and simply driving their car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hazardous and varied terrain of the Junk Race will push your car to its limits, and will send you careening off a cliff or into a tree if your car isn't equipped to handle the challenges of the land. But, wait! Do I see an upgrade station ahead?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
