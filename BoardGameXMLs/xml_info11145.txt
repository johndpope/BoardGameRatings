			<description>A skill game where players vote for the best actresses, actors, directors, movies and songs.  Players draw action cards and decide to use or hold card.  There is no hand size limit.  Used cards are returned to the bottom the pile.  Players then roll a steel ball down the runway twice- first to determine which candidate, the second to determine the cost of the candidate.  After two or more players have a candidate in the same category, one of those players may call for a vote when playing a &amp;quot;Contest&amp;quot; action card.  Vote cards are drawn until a player decides to stand, but beware drawing the &amp;quot;Loser&amp;quot; card that puts you out of the contest immediately.  At this point, all players reveal the vote cards they have just drawn and the high vote getter wins a Hollywood Award.  The winner is the first player to get 3 Hollywood Awards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
