							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vertiginous Golf</name>
									
			<description>Vertiginous Golf is a dystopian steam punk mini golf adventure game set in the skies above an alternate world where life on the ground is enveloped in permanent smog, constant darkness and never-ending rain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After suffering on the ground under a haze of smog and pollution, the people of Scudburough have been split in half by a lottery, with the winners heading up into the clouds to live in a floating city called New Lun-Donne. For those left below, they can get a temporary escape from the gloom through the Vertiginousphere, a device that allows them to rise virtually into the cloudy paradise to play mini golf on challenging obstacle courses floating in the sky. But something is amiss in this nation of two cities. Another voice is trying to break through the propaganda messages of peace and prosperity&amp;hellip; the voice of an insurrection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And now you are invited to experience the world of Vertiginous Golf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
