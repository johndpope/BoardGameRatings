							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paddy O&#039;Shea&#039;s Golf Card Game</name>
									
			<description>A variant of the classic golf card game in which each player puts cards before them on the table in a grid.  Each player plays new cards striving for a low scoring grid (sets do not count against you)  The game is played over 9 rounds, like a 9 hole golf game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paddy O'Shea's version of the game introduces special cards to a pair of traditional 52 card decks.  The special cards include 19th Hole Wild Cards (worth -5 points) and &amp;quot;Good for Nothing&amp;quot; (0 point) mulligan cards. There are also regular jokers and rules that differ slightly from the classic game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
