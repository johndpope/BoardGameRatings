							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thinking Races: Heroes of Iron and Steel</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Thinking Races Series provides new takes on the familiar races of fantasy gaming, and over the course of the line, will introduce several dozen new player races and sub-races to the game. This volume focuses on heroes not made from flesh and blood. The heroic races in this volume are made from sterner, more noble matter: gold, steel, titanium, chrome and iron. Some of the new races in this sourcebook are elemental beings, others are constructs. All are something more than human, more even than Dwarf or Elf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The races in this sourcebook are created by the blending of arcana and technology, and the only two races in this sourcebook actually made of something like skin and bone - the Kobolds and Earthborn Humans - are defined by their mastery of technology and industriousness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Forgeblood Feats presented at the end of this sourcebook were originally presented in 2005's Mega-Feats: New Paths to Victory. The new version printed here has been updated to conform to the changes made to fantasy gaming by the release of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. Relatively minor changes were made, and if you have the original version of these feats, they still work fine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steel yourself for battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
