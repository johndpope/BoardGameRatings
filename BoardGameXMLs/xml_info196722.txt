			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHO IS the Jersey Devil?!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a child, Matilda Mangold was blinded by a chemical truck explosion when she risked herself to save the driver. Her father, a brilliant neurosurgeon, designed sensor horns to attempt to restore her sight, but instead affected all her other senses. For this unsanctioned surgery he was jailed, while others profited from his now-stolen research. Matilda never forgot the injustice. It drove her to study criminal investigation, and learn martial arts to ensure she&amp;rsquo;d never be unable to help someone close to her again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the formation of the Sentinels, and several massive battles with alien invaders and the villainous Overlords, New York and New Jersey suffered. Crime was on the rise and the police were overtasked. Inspired by the rise of costumed heroes, Matilda created a persona and now uses her impressive sensory powers to fight crime as the &amp;ldquo;Jersey Devil.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iconic Legends. Because sometimes you a need a character everyone knows, even if they're meeting them for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
