			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DragonGrace utilized the &amp;quot;Infinity System&amp;quot; as the core mechanic--essentially, a diceless narrative resolution system.  The game went through three major iterations, with the third published iteration (confusingly) called version 2.  The &amp;quot;Infinity System&amp;quot; was not particularly separated from the game itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game belonged to a Race (Humans, Short Elves, High Elves, Dwarves, Suarians, Draconians, Half Fae, Catpeople, Merfolk, or Keet) and selected a Class (Fighter, Thief, Magus, or Psionicists).  Characters then selected Skills.  Skills were grouped according to the base Attribute (Physical, Magical, Psionic, Dexterity, Health, Intelligence, Wisdom) for the Skill.  Magical Skills yielded magical spells, and Psionic Skills yielded psionic powers.  A special category, Thieving Skills, was restricted.  Other Skills were typical for fantasy role-playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game author was identified only as Joe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
