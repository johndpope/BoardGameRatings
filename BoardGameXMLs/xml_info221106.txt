			<description>This is a French journalism-themed card game in which players try to collect sets of reporters, stories and documents. There are three types of cards: 18 Reporter cards (2 each of an English, French and German reporter with corresponding camera and transport cards); 18 Story cards (color-coded red, blue and orange, each with 2 Event cards, 2 Place cards and 2 Interviewee cards); and 18 Document cards (red, blue and orange, each numbered 1-6).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players collect combinations of sets, each of which can be a Reporter with matching equipment, the Event, Place and Interviewee of a color, or three consecutive Document cards of the same color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 2,700 in tokens and a hand of 8 cards, and each turn draws a card and discards a card. The other players in turn order have an opportunity to buy the discard if they can use it to complete a set of three, paying 20 into the pot if they do so. Other players may overbid if eligible, paying 40, 60, etc. If the discard is not claimed, play passes to the left; if it is claimed, play passes to the claimer's left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hand is won when a player completes his hand with one of 7 combinations of sets. The winner takes the pot plus a score that varies with the difficulty of the combination, from 500 for two series of Reporters and one of Stories to 5,000 for three series of different Reporters. Winner of the game is first to 20,000 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game box features celebrated French journalist Georges de Caunes. The artwork suggests it dates to the 1960s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
