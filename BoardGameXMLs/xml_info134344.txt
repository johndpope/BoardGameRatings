			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've been branded a traitor. With Earth too crowded to accommodate yet another prison, they herded you onto a spaceship and launched you into exile. Meanwhile, beneath the surface of an obscure asteroid, robotic drones were already hard at work preparing your new home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One crash landing later, things are really fouled up. Thanks to a radiation leak, the handful of you who survived the impact have at most a fortnight left. Your SOS over the ansible was met with dead air. The only survivor will be the AI who was supposed to oversee the colony; your only chance to leave something behind is to tell her your stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
