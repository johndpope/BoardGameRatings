			<description>A regular Anno Domini set consists of 336 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This small expansion Set &amp;quot;Anno Domini - Fussball WM&amp;quot; contains only 54 events related to Soccer Worldcups. As it is conceived as a free give away (on occasion of the 2006 Worldcup in Germany) it consists only of those 54 cards (no rules, only cards in shrinkwrap). These are to few for a regular game, but can be added to any other games of the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2008, this expansion was included in &amp;quot;Anno Domini - Jubil&amp;auml;ums Metallbox&amp;quot;, a metal box designed to hold 8 regular Anno Domini games. It has no own entry on BGG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&lt;br/&gt;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly. Anno Domini is a blast to play, it is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the Anno Domini series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
