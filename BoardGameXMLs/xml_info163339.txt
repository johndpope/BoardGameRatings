			<description>With a modular map, expandable decks, and the ability to modify key features of the game to make it more or less difficult, We Still Remain caters and expands to meet the needs of all players, from those who are new to the game, to hardened wasteland veterans looking for an extra challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features five core game modes that range from a 30-minute, action-packed capture the objective, to an atmospheric 100-plus-minute resource management scenario that highlights the game's role-playing factors, We Still Remain will fit into any part of your game night lineup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in a post-apocalyptic world that has been overrun with the undead, We Still Remain is the story of survivors fighting to survive in a deserted landscape, scavenging loot and harvesting resources that they need to survive, while trying to avoid... the inevitable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can loot, craft, and fortify, or find a weapon and take the fight to the undead. They can work cooperatively or against each other in scenarios that will test their luck, on an ever-changing map that spans three feet. The game is written as a series of diary entries, but the story is yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
