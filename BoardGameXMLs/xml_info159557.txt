							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fish In A Barrel: The Fish-Linking Game</name>
									
			<description>The Fish-Linking game and more fun than a barrel of monkeys. See how many fish you can catch before time runs out! Includes eight fish (three bass, three trout, and two muskies) in a wood-pattern barrel that&amp;rsquo;s easy to transport to the campsite or even carry along on a fishing trip! Includes stringer, 60 second timer, and rule sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Randomly place all 8 fish on a flat surface...turn over the 60 second timer....grab a fish and link as many together as you can (tail-hook to mouth-hole) before the timer runs out. Earn one point for every fish you link and a bonus point if you link all fish species of the same type back-to-back (example, all bass one behind the other). The player with the most points wins the round and gets to string up their &amp;quot;catch&amp;quot; for show (stringer included).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
