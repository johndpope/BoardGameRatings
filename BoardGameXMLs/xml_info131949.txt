			<description>From the front page of the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Giants are raiding the civilized lands in large bands, visiting death and destruction upon villages, towns, and farmlands. Entire militias have been conquered, whole crops wiped out. Determined to repel the invaders, local lords have called for you to banish the marauding giants from the civilized lands. Thane Arnak, ruler of the stone giants, has gone mad, but he&amp;rsquo;s still the best chance you have of fracturing the giants&amp;rsquo; alliance. A Living Forgotten Realms adapted adventure set near the Sword Mountains for Adventure Level 14 (character levels 11-17).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a very long adventure. We recommend that you allow at least sixteen hours of playing time (which can be spread over multiple game sessions as long as the PCs do not play any other LFR adventure while they are still on this adventure).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is found in Issue 198 of Dungeon online, part of D&amp;amp;D Insider. Dungeon issues may be found on the Wizards of the Coast website (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://wizards.com/dnd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://wizards.com/dnd&lt;/a&gt;). At least one person at the table (either a player or the DM) must have an active subscription to D&amp;amp;D Insider. This is the second part of the Against the Giants Major Quest. The other parts are ADAP4-3 Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, ADAP4-5 Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl, and ADAP4-6 Halls of the Fire Giant King. We encourage you to play the Giants series in order with the same character if possible. Characters that previously played WATE2-2 Closing a Deal may also find a connection with this adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adaptation document does not present adjusted stat blocks for low/high tier; any LFR-legal AL 14 table can play, but bear in mind that the stat blocks in the adventure were written for a party of level 14-16 characters. Tables consisting entirely of 11th- and 12th-level characters might find this adventure difficult; a table of all 17th-level characters might find it easy. The DM is encouraged to make adjustments as needed to ensure a fun time for the players and a challenging but fair experience for the PCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
