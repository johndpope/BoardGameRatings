							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Initiate: A Dungeon World Compatible Class</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some men learn to master a weapon.  Some men learn to command the laws of reality. Some men learn to call on the will of the gods themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You do not need such things: you have mastered yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have learned the secret of fighting with nothing.  Perhaps you were part of a secret tradition, or a grand fighting school.  Perhaps you cobbled your skill together from a &amp;lsquo;school&amp;rsquo; of hard knocks and a &amp;lsquo;master&amp;rsquo; of pain and battle.  Whatever the case, you understand your body in a way that few others can even consider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You know how it moves, how it breaks, how it strikes. It is your greatest tool and your strongest defense. You are never unarmed, and never afraid, for you know the greatest secret there has ever been: with the proper skill, the body can do anything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Initiate is a full class for use with Dungeon World. It includes the class playbook so you can start playing right away, as well as two new compendium classes: The Blindfighter and The Ronin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
