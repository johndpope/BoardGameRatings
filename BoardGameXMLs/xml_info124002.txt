			<description>The equipment for the game com-prises a plastic bowl in the lid of the box and another one fixed in the bottom half; a gross of small cards in six colours with letters on both front and back; and a six- sided top with a differently-coloured spot on each side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are shuffled and dropped in the bowl in the lid of the box. The top is spun in the other bowl and the idea is to grab the cards one at a time and build up words while the top is still spinning. Letters that are unused must be returned before another one is taken. The grab&amp;not;bing must stop immediately the top falls over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One point is scored for every card used in a word which is the same colour as the spot on the top side of the dice when it falls. If the word starts with a white card the score is doubled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round consists of two spins of the top; then the words are broken up and the cards returned to the bowl for the start of a new round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is either the first player to score a set number of points or the high&amp;not;est number of points in a set time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
