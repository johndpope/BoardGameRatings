			<description>Everybody's Golf 4 is the fourth game in the Everybody's Golf series and the second released for PlayStation 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game delivers more realistic physics, sharper graphics, more golfers, caddies and courses than before. miniature golf games and online play for players with the Network Adaptor are also driving features. The developers increased the overall number of characters from 15 to 24, added more caddies (10 in all) and boosted the number of courses from six to 15. Of these 15 courses, 10 are new, while five are returning favorites from the previous game. The game also features a Tournament mode where up to 32 players can compete against each other. Cameo roles as playable characters in the North American and European versions are Ratchet (from the Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank series, in his first appearance) and Jak (from the Jak and Daxter series, as he would later appear in Jak 3). Ratchet and Jak's caddies are Clank and Daxter, respectively. A Pipo Monkey (from the Ape Escape series) is an unlockable caddie in the Japanese and European versions only. The European version seems to have the largest character roster overall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everybody's Golf implements the &amp;quot;Everybody's Points&amp;quot; system where players earn and spend points to unlock new gear and extras. Several different modes of play are available and include Tour (full season of tournaments), Tournament (plug and play instant action mode), VS Mode (challenge golfers to unlock new characters/costumes) and Training (in game tutorial mode). In addition, there are two online play modes: Head to Head (one on one play with another player) and Real Time Tournament (real time online golf tourneys). &lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Everybody's Golf 4&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
