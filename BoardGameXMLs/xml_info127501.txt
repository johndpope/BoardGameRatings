			<description>A kind of &amp;quot;Musical pig&amp;quot; game. It consists of a fluffy pig. When you press the belly, music will start to play. The players stand or sit in a circle and someone presses the pig's belly, then tosses the pig to another player who has to catch it and throw it to the next player as fast as possible. The player who holds the pig when the music stops is out. Continue play until only one player remains. That player is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
