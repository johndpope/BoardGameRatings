			<description>Aegir's Fire: Viking Raider Campaign Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This game is starts in the year 83O AD. It is a time when the Vikings (a collective term for various Norse peoples - Danes, Norwegians, Swedes and Finns), started their raiding of the coastlines within reach of their longships. Their control of the oceans eventually meant that they also became a major trading force, as well as the discoverers and colonisers of places like Iceland and Greenland.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In this game, you are a minor Viking village leader (think up a suitable name). You have managed to stretch the village&amp;rsquo;s resources to the point of building a longship, to the latest and most fashionable design.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You will be able to equip and man the ship from your village initially, and dependent upon success or otherwise in your first voyages, you will be able to recruit more experienced fighters from outside the village.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Success is measured in two ways, status and treasure. These are self-evident.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
