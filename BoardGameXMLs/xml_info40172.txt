			<description>DVD Spel van het Jaar (translation: DVD Game of the year) is a Dutch quizz boardgame. The game is published by Nova Carta BV in cooperation with the Dutch state television (NOS) ad a Dutch newspaper (De Telegraaf).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to collect five different &amp;lsquo;DVD-chips&amp;rsquo; (blue, green, purple, red and yellow), winner is the player who is the first to do so. The chips can be earned by correctly answering questions from different categories such as sports, politics and showbizz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A die is used to move the players pawns around the board. If a pawn ends up on a small space, the player is asked a question from one of the cards. When the corect answer is given, the player can roll the die once more and move on. Whenever a pawn ends up on a &amp;lsquo;DVD-space&amp;rsquo;, the DVD is started and a randomly selected question is played on the TV screen. If the question is answerd correctly, the player recieves a DVD-chip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A yearly published DVD (starting whith 2007) can be used as an expansion to the base game, but can also be played as a seperate DVD-game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
