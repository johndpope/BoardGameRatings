			<description>Yet another packaging of Guggenheim/Categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A spinner determines what five categories and the five initial letters will use. The players have three minutes to complete their grids. When time has elapsed, each player may choose any square on one's grid for a free ten points. Players, then, compare answers. Ten points are scored for each unique answer. Each player scores five points for each duplicated answer. There is no penalty for illegal or no responses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One interesting note: the game's catalog number is 666.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
