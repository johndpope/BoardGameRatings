			<description>Algarade is a 2 to 6 player fast-paced, strategic, card game where you need to eliminate all your Opponents by destroying their political Landmarks and crown yourself the new leader!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algarade is played turn by turn in a counterclockwise manner. You start your turn by drawing 2 playing cards and playing as many cards as you can or want without playing the same card twice. Once you are satisfied or cannot play anymore, you pass the turn to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;Remember, even though you need to destroy your opponent's Landmarks to win, playing all your cards every turn makes you an easy target!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To help you eliminate your Opponents you will have access to 19 unique playing cards that will either help you attack your enemies, defend your own territories or destabilize other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These cards are separated into 3 categories:&lt;br/&gt;Red cards that may only played during your turn,&lt;br/&gt;Yellow cards that may played anytime,&lt;br/&gt;and Blue cards that can only be played under certain circumstances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules evolve with the amount of players that play. When playing with 2 to 3 people, all other players are your enemies. You can build temporary alliances but be ready for the inevitable backstabbing. When playing with 4 to 6 players you have Allies that you may not attack, but will still need to compete with to win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional information:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algarade is a one-man project from the mind of Olivier Etienne Miller. Originally a game to be played with his family and close friends, it became quite popular in his circle of friends which eventually lead him to start a Kickstarter to spread the game to a wider audience!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
