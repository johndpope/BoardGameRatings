							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alchemist of Five Elements</name>
									
			<description>Story:&lt;br/&gt;  Long ago, the power of five elements was operating in the whole land. Metal manufactured tools. Wood bred creations. Water moisturized lives. Fire warmed world. And Earth created land. Five elements mutually generated and overcame each other. In this circle, all creations within heaven and earth never ended.&lt;br/&gt;  In the vast land, only a few people could master all five elements. People called them &amp;ldquo;The Alchemist&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;  One day, the empire held a competition of five elements to find the best alchemist. And you are one of them.&lt;br/&gt;  You have to follow the secret book, and use your magic spell and ancient artifact to collect specific element stones. Once you succeed, you will be the best alchemist in the world. But be careful, all your element stones may suddenly token by other alchemists. And your soul and body may be torn apart because of wrong element stones&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;  In the beginning of the game, players choose their target cards. And in each turn, player moves on the five element map and uses the function card to collect element stones or to do the special function. Players have to reach the alchemy condition on his target card. Once a player reaches his target, then he wins, and the game is over. But if someone reaches the soul-broken condition on his target card, then he has to restart.So, hide you target carefully. And start to enjoy the magic power of Chinese five elements!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
