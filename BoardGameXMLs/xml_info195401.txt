			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game have three Attributes with numeric Ranks, purchased from a points pool.  Each Attribute has two associated skills:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Physical: Athletics and Toughness&lt;br/&gt;     Mental: Academics and Magic&lt;br/&gt;     Social: Deception and Diplomacy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters also may have additional Traits that yield special in game benefits such as the ability to use a rudimentary form of magic.  The game uses wound levels for characters, though the focus is not on combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action resolution uses a process of establishing a target number of successes.  All players have a bag of tokens (colored marbles are suggested).  The game master then performs a token draw; the player then performs a token drawn and the results are compared.  Tokens are aligned in color pairs from each draw, each pairing counting as one success.  Tokens are subsequently returned to their respective bags.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
