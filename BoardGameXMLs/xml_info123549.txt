							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">So What&#039;s the Hoard Like, Anyway?</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your PCs are deep in the dungeon and have just defeated a terrifying dragon! As they bandage their wounds, and ready their fallen friend's bodies for return to the surface, they look around and ask &amp;quot;So what's in the dragon's hoard, anyway?&amp;quot; At that point, unless the GM has prepared a detailed list of treasure the PCs get (possibly) literally tons of coins and some generic magic items. (After all, most GMs have better things to do with their prep time than generate treasure descriptions for stuff the PCs will likely sell as soon as they get back to town.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So What's the Hoard Like, Anyway? banishes these problems by providing a veritable hoard of 84 pre-generated, ready-to-use lists of highly detailed treasure hoards ready to insert into almost any GM's campaign. Usable with any monster (not just dragons - this is not an excuse to put more dragons in your dungeons) the lists are broken down by character level making it easy to choose an appropriate hoard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So What's the Hoard Like, Anyway? presents hoards appropriate for character levels 1-7.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;about the PDF&lt;br/&gt;This product is a Dual Format PDF. The downloadable ZIP file contains two versions, one optimised for printing and use on a normal computer and one optimised for use on a mobile device such as an iPad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
