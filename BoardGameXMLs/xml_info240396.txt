			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story so far...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a fine day for larceny upon the high seas indeed! The Devil hisself must have blest the crew of the Black Kraken with his own luck&amp;mdash;how else could it be that you would happen upon the fat Spanish treasure galleon the Urca de Lima, separated from her escort and crippled by one of the worst storms that ever scoured the ocean? Then again, even in these most favourable circumstances, the Spaniards fought long and hard before you finally took her. The Urca de Lima now trails behind you, a small prize crew doing what they can to keep her limping along just long enough to get to the port of Tortuga.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been clear sailing all week all the way back to Tortuga&amp;mdash;almost suspiciously easy-going and peaceful, in fact&amp;mdash;and without much to do the crew&amp;rsquo;s been going stir-crazy thinking about how they&amp;rsquo;ll spend their ill-gotten rewards. In fact, the Captain&amp;rsquo;s arranged for an early share of the loot to be divided amongst the crew. Those who aren&amp;rsquo;t needed to sail the ship are able to enjoy the rest of the evening with a little bit of early gambling and drinking, so everyone is in high spirits. All that&amp;rsquo;s left now is to enjoy the rest of the evening as you coast into port, and maybe swindle some of your fellows out of their share.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wait, what's all this about a curse?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blackened Hearts is a live action roleplaying (LARP) scenario for 8 to 15 players plus a Game Master (GM) that runs for approximately two and a half hours, not including set up and tidying afterward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a LARP, you take on the role of a character and physically act out that character&amp;rsquo;s actions, pursuing their goals and interacting with other players while remaining &amp;lsquo;in character&amp;rsquo;. More specifically, this scenario is a parlour-style LARP, meaning that the area of play is confined to a relatively small area and the focus is on roleplay and intrigue rather than combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blackened Hearts uses a very simple set of mechanics to govern what a character is able to do in the context of the scenario. It is designed to be played with the assistance of a GM who will facilitate the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The download package includes a main document that outlines everything you need to know to play and printable PDF versions of all material that need to be printed prior to the LARP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
