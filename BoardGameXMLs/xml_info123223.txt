							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pike &amp; Shotte</name>
									
			<description>From Warlord Games website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Pike &amp;amp; Shotte is Warlord Games' third rulebook publication. It is a beautiful book in its own right with hundreds of colour photo of the most exquisitely painted model soldiers taken from the world s foremost collections. The rule book's intention is to inspire a collector to play gentlemanly games with their collections of soldiers with friends where the emphasis is on the spirit of the period, not the letter of the rule. It is a hearty publication and not for nitpickers or miseries. There are some good gags in it, but it also plays well and enables players to conduct a very big battle in a reasonable period of time, leaving them more time to chat about the highs and lows and what ifs...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pike &amp;amp; Shotte closes the gap that Warlord Games left between the &amp;quot;Hail Caesar&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;Black Powder&amp;quot; rulebooks. Using the hallmark Warlord Games orders system (a player must state what his units are about to do, then make a leadership roll dice to check the efficiency with whom of the order given is received), with a 3-phases turn modality that clearly brings the Rick Priestley firm, the game is very smooth, fast and less detailed and mechanic than its stronger competitor, the Field of Glory Renaissance system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
