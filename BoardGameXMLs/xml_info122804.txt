			<description>Zatch Bell! Mamodo Battles, known as Konjiki no Gash Bell!!:: Yuujou Tag Battle 2!! in Japan, is a 3D fighting game based on the Zatch Bell! anime series.  The game depicts the storyline of the manga and anime just prior to the Ancient Mamodo arc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every one thousand years, one hundred mamodo descend upon the earth to fight the ultimate battle. The winning mamodo becomes the mighty king of the mamodo world. There is only one problem - in order for the mamodo to use their powerful spell books, they need a human partner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the story mode, the player can choose one of six characters to use and play through a unique campaign for each character. The game also has a time attack mode that scores the player after battling eight opponents, and a practice mode that allows the player to train against a dummy opponent. As the player progresses and spends time in the game, they earn points that can be used to unlock upgraded characters. Points can also be used to purchase unlockable cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Zatch Bell! Mamodo Battles&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
