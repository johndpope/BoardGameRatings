			<description>Players listen to a story being read from the included booklet. At specific points the players can turn 1 memory card trying to find the one with the illustration that belongs to the specific point in the story. If a player turns the wrong memory card this card is placed back (face down). If the correct memory card is correct he/she can keep it and the story continues until a next memory card needs to be found. Now the player left of the player that found the correct memory-card can turn a card first. This continues until all memory cards have been collected by the players. The player with the most cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
