			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is loosely based upon the movie &amp;quot;The Jewel of the Nile&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player operates 3 characters whom he first must free from their Arabic prisons. Once he succeeds in joining them the player has to find his way through a number of screens by placing his characters (equipped with grenades, gun and an umbrella) at the best spots before some enemies will appear. The characters will automatically engage the opponent. During the confrontation, the player only controls the last character he placed. Once his characters all survive the engagement, the player can move on to the next screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
