			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Armored Core 2 was a launch title for the PlayStation 2. Released in late 2000, this game is set almost 70 years after the original PlayStation series. The player is a mercenary in the Raven's Nest who pilots a giant mech (or &amp;quot;Armored Core&amp;quot;) in a variety of missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can upgrade and customize nearly every aspect of their AC using money earned from completing missions. As the player advances through the game, more advanced parts become available for purchase in addition to hidden parts that can be found in some levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also an arena mode, which pits the player against other Ravens in order to earn both cash and new parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
