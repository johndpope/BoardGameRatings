			<description>Designer's comments:&lt;br/&gt;Dangers and Dweomers is my personal spin on Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complete, free, OGL game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I took the chance of writing it after Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry made its appareance, as a base I used S&amp;amp;W, the BFRPG by Chris Gonnermann and the d20 SRD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As much as possible I streamlined the S&amp;amp;W system, filling what I found as gaps with material from the BFRPG and the Srd. As always my ideal model is the D&amp;amp;D Rules Cyclopedia.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;After a long while I've decided to do some more work on Dangers and Dweomers. I've added to the page THE BLUEBOOK OF DANGERS AND DWEOMERS, basically a return to more Old School sensibilities. this is the version I'm currently GMing the rare times I get to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;This re-working of the Dangers &amp; Dweomers rules has subtle changes to the rules that lean more towards an old-school gaming sensibility.  For example, the section on gaining experience,  the original Dangers &amp; Dweomers states that experience is gained for killing monsters, gaining treasure and roleplaying your character.  The Bluebook edition of the rules omits roleplaying as a source of experience for characters.  it also includes tables for wilderness encounters and a section on retainers &amp;amp; assistants.  The section of referee's information has been re-edited as well and the small interior line-art illustrations have been removed, reducing the page count considerably.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
