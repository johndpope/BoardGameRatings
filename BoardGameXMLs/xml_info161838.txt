							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Champions of Fire Mountain</name>
									
			<description>In Champions of Fire Mountain, you represent one of four clans battling for supremacy in the Frankish Kingdom of 768 AD. Drawing upon the four elements across the land, you use their power to build a variety of medieval buildings to empower your army for battle. Once all opponents have been beaten in combat, the final victor is crowned Champion of Fire Mountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Champions, each player begins with 5 Basic Lands and 5 Light Soldiers. In the center of the table, a random selection of Building cards, Treasures and Soldiers can be purchased and added to each player's decks during their turn. Through skilled planning, players amass more cards and use their armies to defeat all the opponents on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Champions contains 342 cards, consisting of 20 Building Sets, 3 Soldier varieties, 3 Treasure options, 4 Basic Land piles and 12 Legendary Cards. Players chose 8 out of 20 Building Sets to create game variety and use their Soldiers to reduce their opponent's life score from 30 to 0.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
