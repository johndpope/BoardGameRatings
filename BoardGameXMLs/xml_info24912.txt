							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eddie&#039;s Eleven</name>
									
			<description>Eddie the eagle and a whole flock of his friends (including Richie the Rabbit, Danny Dof, Wendy the Wolf, Alan the Alligator, and Felicity Frog) want to teach you how to sequence your numbers.  The first player has to start by playing Eddie who is number 11.  The next player can now play a 12 or a 10 of the same color or another Eddie.  If you can't play, you have to draw another card.  Be the first to get rid of your cards and you win.  Simple, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
