			<description>So, you're one of the cats in the back yard and the birds out there are all yours! All you have to do is play your cards right and best those other cats!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cats all start with the same cards: 1 Catch, 2 Stalk, 1 Play, 1 Steal, 1 Taunt, and 1 Eat. No luck of the draw here, it's entirely up to you! Get as many enjoyment points as possible and win the game! Be clever and anticipate what the others will do so that you can claim victory. Each player will target another cat and a location where a bird is hanging out. They will then select their actions for the 2 rounds of action. All of the cards are revealed simultaneously, they get resolved and when the smoke clears, some cats may have birds and some may not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The birds will hang out at the bird bath, in the grass, on the fence or in the trees. The bigger birds will need to be stalked before catching them and you will have to time everything just right. Once you do catch your bird you will have a choice to either press your luck and play with the bird to double its enjoyment point value or to just eat it. The longer you play with it the greater the chance of it being stolen by another cat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taunt cards allow other cats to distract you and cancel your actions, nothing is safe in this back yard!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
