			<description>The idea behind The Tide is the cooperation between two designers. An author from daVinci (Silvano Sorrentino, &amp;quot;Dancing Dice&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Ostrakon&amp;quot; among others) has written the first page of these rules, while an author from Red Omega Studio (Piero Cioni, &amp;quot;Crazy Rally&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Tortuga&amp;quot;), has completed the work. Successful experiment? You call it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing area is made up of a 6 x 6 area of tiles (the extra 36 tiles are placed in 6 piles of 6 tiles each at the top of the paying area, which represent the tide.) Each player controls 4 pawns, representing friends who are collecting shells &amp;amp; cleaning up trash at a beach. On his turn, each player can do one of the following: move one of his friends, collect ONE seashell, or collect one OR MORE pieces of rubbish. Each time a tile is removed, it is replaced by a tile from the tide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends as soon as one of the following conditions is met: one of the players reaches 10 points: that player is the winner, OR one of the column runs out of tiles (no tiles in the column, no tiles in the relevant pile); the winner is the player with the most points. In case of a tie, the winner among tied players is the one with the most tiles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Note: the link on the game's website to the pieces is broken. However, you can get the components from the Italian edition -- here's the link to the archive: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.davincigames.it/giocarea/archivio/giocarea11.zip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.davincigames.it/giocarea/archivio/giocarea11.zip&lt;/a&gt;. The components are language-independent.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game appeared in issue #11 of GiocAreA Online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
