			<description>This is a open-source, resource light game in the style of Avalon-Hill's Dune board game, that is friendlier to beginners, faster, easier logistically (4 players instead of 6), with greater rule clarity, and a strong sense of theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four factions fight to control the of the land of the Red Dragon:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dwarves, who sell their treasury of artifacts to the highest bidder to fund their armies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Elves, cunning and mysterious, who possess arcane magic that reveals future events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Goblins, who's bloodthirsty mercenaries fight for gold, even against their own king. Their thirst for treasure finds them with a trove of artifacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Orcs, who control the wild lands of the west. They worship the mighty Red Dragon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns, buying artifacts to use in battle, recruiting forces and moving armies to collect gold and capture castles. All while a horde of wild dragons move through the land, decimating everything that comes before them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle plans are made in secret and simultaneously revealed. Magic artifacts are used to support your armies. Even the winner of a battle can suffer terrible attrition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deals made publicly between players are magically bound, and must be honored, if possible. This, along with the tremendous cost of battle, adds a strong political component to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may ally and share their advantages, but there can still be only one winner. The first player to end a turn controlling 3 or more castles has won the game. If there is no winner after 8 turns, then the Red Dragon still rules the land, and it's patron, the Orcs, win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is licensed Creative Commons Share-Alike 4.0.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
