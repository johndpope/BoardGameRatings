			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;The following is another scenario for the Tirikéku rules. Set during the reign of Dhich'un&amp;eacute; the Usurper, the adventure involves Tsoly&amp;aacute;ni citizens in Mu'ugalavy&amp;aacute;. Because it is an extremely role-playing heavy scenario, it can be easily adapted to any rules set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from Setting the Scene:&lt;br/&gt;The protagonists are staying at the Red Star clanhouse in Kh&amp;eacute;iris, a coastal city in southern Mu'ugalavy&amp;aacute;. The Clan Patriarch is Hekk&amp;uacute;nish M&amp;aacute;tir, a quite capable Tsoly&amp;aacute;ni-speaker. Kh&amp;eacute;iris has two off-shore lighthouses. Most of the coast is dangerously rocky with high cliffs, but there is at least one good sheltered cove. At this time of year the weather is blustery, with high humidity and warm rains blown in off the sea. Occasionally hurricanes bring cooler rain, but this is naturally not very welcome since it puts a halt to all shipping and often costs lives due to flooding, storm damage, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure begins with Hekk&amp;uacute;nish asking the protagonists to go up to a villa on the cliff-tops to look in on Ssiriei hiFushmangar, a clan-member of Tsoly&amp;aacute;ni extraction. He explains that she arrived home unexpectedly after a trip abroad and he just wants to see if there's anything she needs. Since the protagonists are Tsoly&amp;aacute;ni themselves (and presumably include at least one Red Star member), it seems appropriate that they go to drop in on her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
