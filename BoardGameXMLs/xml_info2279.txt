			<description>My copy is dated 1992 but the copyright goes back to 1978 (it was renewed in 1980 and 1982 as well).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a sort of cross between Monopoly and a light wargame like Risk.  The board has an outer track, very Monopoly like, but a map occupies the space inside.  It is divided into 16 countries, forming colour groups known as Cartels.  As you go around, you buy up &amp;quot;countries&amp;quot; to charge other players &amp;quot;port fees&amp;quot;; the countries can have their industry developed by buying Factories (e.g. houses/hotels).  The Community Chest/Chance cards have been replaced by Spot Market and Commodity Exchange decks, which are used to simulate a player's speculating on the spot market.  A key difference from Monopoly is that you can build up your military and use it as an alternate means of conquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
