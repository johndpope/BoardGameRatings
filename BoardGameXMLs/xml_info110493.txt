							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Das Indianer-Spiel</name>
									
			<description>The game board shows an Indian camp in full swing, each player tries to find 8 tiles corresponding to his theme tile from a total of 48 tiles, colour coding makes it easier to spot fitting tiles. In his turn a player can turn up as many tiles as he wants - if &amp;quot;&amp;Uuml;berfall&amp;quot; is turned up the move ends and he receives no tiles. If he ends his move voluntarily he can keep all tiles corresponding to his theme. The first player who has found all 8 tiles can lay out all tiles on the board, ends the game and wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
