							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Orange Revolution</name>
									
			<description>Orange Revolution  is a block CDG game that pits Viktor Yushchenko against Viktor Yanukovych. Orange Revolution puts you into the revolution with its tense, thematic gameplay. Whether campaigning, attempting assassinations, or drumming up protesters to the Maidan, the many varied options will ensure each game is different &amp;mdash; and with five total turns, the game is playable in 90-120 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those unfamiliar with the series, Orange Revolution is played on a game board depicting the many oblasts or regions that comprise Ukraine. Each region can have 1-11 influence points placed there. Cards are used to move blocks and leaders from region to region, add influence points, exploit events, and bring protestors and militia to the Maidan. Blocks &amp;mdash; representing political forces such as Pora, avid supporters and government forces &amp;mdash; battle for the hearts and minds of the Ukrainian people. Blocks need to be present in a region to add influence points or for a leader to hold a rally in a region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Maidan may be activated during the game, leading to a sub game of amassing supporters and militia. The blue forces will have to choose to crackdown on the orange forces or allow the dangerous, but historical peaceful protests to swell. Will you bring Tulia Tymoshenko or Yushchenko to the Maidan to draw more crowds? Or use them to rally across the nation?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orange Revolution will immerse you in the events of its namesake with thematic mechanisms, events and graphics. The Orange Revolution has begun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
