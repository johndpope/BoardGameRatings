							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Enigmata 2: Genu&#039;s Revenge</name>
									
			<description> User Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enigmata 2 is much more refined than its predecessor and offers several novel capabilities. You will select your initial spaceship among a choice of three and experience intense space battle in a series of levels. Upgrades, as well as gold, may be gathered when you destroy enemies. At the end of every level there is a much more powerful boss to beat. Also, you can replay any level for the purpose of gaining extra gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the course of the game you will have the chance to improve your vessel by visiting the shop and buying various useful items, skills, missiles or even a new ship. For example, you can improve your ship's armor and shields, improve your ship's speed, assign nanobots that will automatically repair it when damaged and many more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
