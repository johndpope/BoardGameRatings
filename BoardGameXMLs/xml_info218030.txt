							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Abbey of St. Martin</name>
									
			<description>An adventure for low-level characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few years ago, not from the village, an order of monks established a modest abbey under the Rule of St. Martin. In addition to the normal work of monks, namely prayer and a little bit of farming, the Martinians cultivated an orchard of peach trees and sponsored the village's annual Festival of Peaches. The abbey fell to marauding orcs and ogres. So terrible were the desecrations perpetrated by those monsters that the abbey was never reclaimed even after the orcs and ogres were driven from the region. Today, the abbey stands, overgrown by weeds and vines, crumbling and largely open to the elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
