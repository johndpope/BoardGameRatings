			<description>From the instructions: Morra-board builds on an ancient game - renewing and varying it by linking it to a board.&lt;br/&gt;The old game on which Morra-board is based is in Danish called 'Klunse', in English 'Odds and Evens'. Each of the two players presents a clenched fist containing a few small stones, coins or matches - both players taking turns at guessing if the sum of the objects in the two hands is even or uneven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players pieces move around the track based on how many total marbles the two players reveal. If the inner track has a marking on it, the piece advances. The goal is to be the first to advance all the way to the center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
