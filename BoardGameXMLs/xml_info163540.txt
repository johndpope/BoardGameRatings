							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wastelands: Tribes of the Apocalypse</name>
									
			<description>Wastelands: Tribes of the Apocalypse is set an unknown time after a thermonuclear and chemical war wiped out 90% of Earth&amp;rsquo;s population. Groups of nomadic wanderers, who somehow managed to survive, banded together to form tribes. Resources have become incredibly scarce, decontaminated resources even more so, and survival has become nigh-on-impossible.&lt;br/&gt;There is, however, one last hope for survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NEW EDEN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A bastion of hope, this fortified stronghold is the last refuge from the apocalyptic wastelands where, if radiation doesn't kill you, another tribe probably will. NEW EDEN is allowing sanctuary to one tribe, but to prove which tribe is the most worthy, an offering must be presented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Offer what you can to NEW EDEN, and if your offering is the greatest, your tribe will be awarded refuge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If not? Well, those cockroaches are looking delicious...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Wastelands: Tribes of the Apocalypse each player is the  leader of a Tribe occupying the harsh Wastelands. The aim of the game is to gather resources which you can trade for various offerings on the Black Market. The player who has gathered the greatest offering to present to NEW EDEN gains entry into the city and wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other players are doomed to an eternity roaming the desecrated remains of what was once Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
