			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Trakan pilot at your wing send out a brief, crackling message as your spacecraft skims the lifeless surface of the planet Ruoka:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'I know this is some kind of Crystal Clone hotspot, but I wouldn't want to live here. What's more, looks like a rotten place for a visit.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can't really blame her: endless stretches of silicon desert don't add up to many folks' idea of paradise. However, beneath that wasteland is enough Xantium crystal to power every spacecraft in the galaxy; both the Star Teams and the Alliance have been lucky enough to keep a sweetheart arrangement going with the strand Ruokan Crystal Folk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is, until three weeks ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why would a group of Star Team members get up a cut-and-run raid on a Ruokan Xantium mine? That is, if the raiders were Star Team members at all? And what about those Imperial hoodlums who are trying to snuggle up to the Crystal Folk, promising 'protection from Star Team aggression'? For sure, a cool reception is waiting for you down there; problem is, there's no telling what else is brewing - all because somebody cooked up a heavy duty LIGHTSPEED RAID.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LIGHTSPEED RAID is a STAR ACE adventure packed with enough action, intrigue and suspense to challenge any Veteran Star Team member. Inside, you'll find a wild and dangerous adventure that takes you on a breakneck interplanetary chase. You'll also find character cards, maps, and hours of role-playing fun. Be sure to look for other fine products from Pacesetter.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
