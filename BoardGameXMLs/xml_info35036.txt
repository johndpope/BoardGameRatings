			<description>From the rules: &amp;quot;The object of Lowell Thomas' World Cruise game is to circle the globe and return to New York first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes, as an important part of the play, educational features which teach the players the main points of interest in the many cities and lands which they visit in the course of their travels.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A roll-and-move race game with a bit of money management, different modes of transportation, and trivia questions.  Mule and sailing vessel (for $100), bicycle and tramp steamer ($400), train and cruise ship ($700), and airplane and zeppelin ($1000).  Note that trans-continental zeppelin travel was a real possibility when the game was designed, just before the Hindenburg disaster in 1937.  Each mode gives you a multiplier on your die roll (times 1 through times 4) for movement.  Two decks of cards (blue ones for random benefits and red ones for random penalties) correspond to blue and red spaces on the board.  Don't just go to jail, go to Devil's Island or the fortification of Tokio (sp).  Numbered spaces offer the chance to answer trivia questions in two books (one for Globe Trotters, one for Young People) to win or lose $100.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
