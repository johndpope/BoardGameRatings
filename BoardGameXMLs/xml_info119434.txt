			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An organisation known as &amp;quot;The Church&amp;quot; has taken global power after the devastation of World War III in 2070. The war left the world in a dark state, two thirds of the Earth's population having died and infant death rates skyrocketing for the survivors. Twenty two years later and one of the Church's undercover operatives, Alura Valentine, is involved in a train accident en route to assassinate an executive of the rival &amp;quot;Heretics Group&amp;quot;. As the player, from this point you control Alura (a teenage girl with telepathic and other mental abilities that assist her in conversations and battles), and must explore RPG-style to try to find the truth of all the unusual events that have recently started occurring in Church-held lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
