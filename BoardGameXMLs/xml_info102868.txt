			<description>From &amp;quot;Adventure Summary and Background:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A council of seven individuals called The Council of Wisdom governs the Republic of Altheria. However, this council is deeply divided. Four of the members want to maintain the status quo, but the other three members advocate sweeping changes. The radical faction wants to withhold blast powder shipments from all of Onara and use the powder to build huge bombs to destroy the Ssethregoran menace forever. To protect Altheria from the inevitable backlash of a blast powder embargo, they also want to petition Althares for his third gift. This radical group only needs one thing to gain the popular support necessary to take such drastic steps, a major Ssethregoran victory over the Shining Patrol. The radicals have decided to make this event happen, and they have chosen a city to sacrifice to their grand plan. The chosen city is named Semar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
