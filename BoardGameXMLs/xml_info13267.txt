			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of Drakyre!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drakyre is a world of Heroes, Monsters, Treasures and a whole lot more. Each deck of Age of Heroes will be a full set of collectible cards which can be used to play a solitaire or multi-player card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are divided into Heroes, Treasure and Monsters. Treasure is broken into Weapons and Armor and Spells and Items. Players receive a party of heroes and attempt to defeat the monsters, gaining treasure each time you defeat a monster. The game is essentially solitaire; you score based on how many defense points of monsters you beat divided by how many heroes you lost. In multi-player, you are fighting the same set of monsters and are competing to see who can score highest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
