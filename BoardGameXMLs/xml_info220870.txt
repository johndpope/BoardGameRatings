			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here We Come to Save the Day!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is battle, and then there is warfare. Many adventurers are familiar with wading into combat against monsters and small groups of enemies, but this is nothing next to the glory and chaos and carnage that is true war. More than simply a change in scale, the difference between war and other combat can be profound. In a war, the characters are part of something larger than themselves, contributing to the efforts of their armies, or perhaps leading those armies themselves. The priorities of a soldier are different from those of an adventurer, and often the challenges that they face are, as well. While many characters can translate their talents as adventurers to the battlefield, one who specifically focuses on warfare and battlefield tactics will have the edge on others when it comes to true war. Each installment of Weekly Wonders: Archetypes of War provides six new war-themed archetypes for a variety of classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this book, we focus on cavalry, mounted soldiers whose power and speed make them versatile and effective units in any military battle. Whether they are lightly-armored and trained for speed and maneuverability, harrying opposing forces on their flanks and then retreating before they can retaliate, or whether they use the raw power and momentum of their charging steeds to deliver devastating routs against enemies who are trampled underfoot, this book provides archetypes that highlight the roles of cavalry in warfare. This book contains the following archetypes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The mounted harrier, a cavalier archetype that focuses on crushing foes underhoof with devastating charges.&lt;br/&gt;    The wild knight, a druid archetype whose animal companion serves as a fearsome mount, carrying her into battle with incredible ferocity.&lt;br/&gt;    The spirit rider, a shaman archetype that trades in a traditional familiar for a more powerful animal companion, which serves as a mount and carries its rider through the spirit realm, as well as gaining special boons based on her spirit.&lt;br/&gt;    The pale rider, a spiritualist archetype that imitates the grim reaper, riding a phantom steed and delivering a frightful gaze to horrify her foes.&lt;br/&gt;    The otherworld cavalry, a summoner archetype whose eidolon not only serves as a powerful mount, but can carry him and other riders across the planes.&lt;br/&gt;    A bonus archetype for the warlord, from Path of War by Dreamscarred Press, the daring rider applies the same tactical gambits as other warlords to a mounted style of combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
