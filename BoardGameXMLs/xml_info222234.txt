			<description>Kingdom is an abstract strategy game played on a 9x9 board with a King piece and stacks of 1-4 checkers called Knights. Pieces can move to an adjacent empty cell or jump over an adjacent piece. Knights may only jump over a Knight smaller than themselves, except a one-high Knight may jump over a four-high Knight. Pieces capture by moving into an enemy piece's space. Any piece may capture a King, and Kings may capture Knights, but Knights may not capture Knights (they only block each other). The player who captures the enemy king or occupies the enemy king's starting location wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
