			<description>'Just what the hell is going on here?'&lt;br/&gt;Something is happening behind the scenes in New Centennial City. A gang war has erupted in the Projects and an influenza epidemic sweeps the city. Meanwhile, a man has gone missing and no one seems willing to help find him. The players get asked to help and inadvertently get pulled into a web of lies, deceit and confusion.&lt;br/&gt;Masks of Darkness introduces several new underground ernpathic cells that are active in New Centennial City. They, together with the players, will work together to uncover the truth that lurks behind the facade of everyday city life. If the players aren't careful, they could get more than they bargained for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
