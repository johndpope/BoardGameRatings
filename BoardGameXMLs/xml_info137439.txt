			<description>From the Front Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fifth-season is a contemporary live role play event set in a modern day world using a mix of conventional drama based role play skills and modern airsoft weapons to create a fast moving environment in which players can use a variety of skills and options to interact with the world around them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fifth-season is NOT an airsoft skirmish game - combat is often a poor choice of last resort when diplomacy, technology wit or guile just won't get you through a situation. Ammunition is limited in all games and combat will often be short, sharp and brutal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters will have a mix of skills from many different areas and each character will be able to develop along either a generalist approach and have many low level skills or fewer, more specialised and developed skill areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fifth-season games are all fully catered and players are encouraged to stay on site and in character at all times. Events are carefully planned and paced with plot lines running in the background of the players' actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
