			<description>A One-round Living City Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A man named Mallory Stanobloff has come to Ravens Bluff. He is a master of disguise and he is looking for the last known living member of a rival family, in order to kill her. She is a threat to his family taking control of the island of Orlumbor just off the Sword Coast by Waterdeep. The renowned mage, Delshara Windhair, sent the child, Tatiana Windwalker, away to protect her from those who wish her dead and has aided in getting Mallory Stanobloff exiled. The current ruler was hand-picked by the former ruler before he was killed in the blood feud between the two families. Tatiana is still a baby and has been put in the care of a &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; vampire. Delshara believed this would dissuade Mallory from trying to get to the child. She was wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vampire, Cassandra Flame, has been on the run for many months, over land and sea, and has just arrived in Ravens Bluff with the child. Tatiana is to be delivered to a druid residing in Ravens Bluff known as Kudzu. However, Mallory is hot on her trail and will kill her as she leaves her boat that has just docked. Hopefully, the PCs will step in and thwart Mallory&amp;rsquo;s plans of killing Tatiana by taking the child to safety. However, Stanobloff will do whatever is necessary to see that the child dies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
