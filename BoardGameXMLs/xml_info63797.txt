							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Top Chef Quickfire Challenge</name>
									
			<description>The highest-rated food show on cable television serves up a hot new trivia game! Up to six people can play individually or more can form teams and vie for the glory--and the title--of Top Chef. Relive favorite episode moments by answering questions about the contestants, the judges, and the food. What part of the pig does ham come from: the belly, the hind leg, or the back? Which Top Chef judge earned three Michelin stars by the age of 26? Answer correctly and become Top Chef. Answer incorrectly and it&amp;rsquo;s time to &amp;quot;pack your knives and go!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
