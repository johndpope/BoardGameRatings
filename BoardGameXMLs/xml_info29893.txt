							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stop Relax &amp; Think</name>
									
			<description>Players roll and move along a track. Players must satisfy the conditions of either stopping, relaxing (engaging in an activity that is thought of as relaxing), or thinking. When a player has successfully traversed the track, he or she wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the creator:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STOP, RELAX, and THINK evolved out of my work with children at Fourth Street Project over the last four years. We work with a lot of impulsive children at Fourth Street on gaining greater skills in self-control. We have found that enhancing children's awareness of their feelings, teaching problem-solving skills and pairing that with relaxation training increases their ability to own their part in problems and to gain a greater internal locus of control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
