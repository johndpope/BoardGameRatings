							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ten Uses for Incomplete Clones</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life Is Cheap...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...and we're passing the savings on to you! Genetically engineered humans and clones can be very expensive items, and there are always people complaining about how ethical it may be to use them for dangerous tasks, or even to sell them at all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But now, with stable clones removed from their cloning tanks at a point where they are viable, but not yet complete, we can eliminate many of the more expensive parts of the procedure. No longer will you be spending a hundred thousand or even fifty thousand dollars on your artificially grown life form - you can have one of these very useful and practical Incomplete Clones for around five thousand dollars!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Want them trained to do menial tasks? That's not a problem... for a little extra, we can program them with a wide variety of skills for all sorts of tasks. To tell you the truth, you may even find a few programs on the black market to teach these clones some skills that some people would find questionable, distasteful, or patently dangerous. We're not here to judge you, though... we just want to sell you some Incomplete Clones for all of your needs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sure, they're not much to look at, they can't handle direct sunlight, and they have a very limited lifespan, but that's part of the beauty of it! We're sure that you'll be able to find some uses for these clones that will more than pay for them in the time that you'll have them - and they're easy to replace!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We'll even come and pick them up from you when they expire... no matter what they expire from, no questions asked. We're not going to tell you what not to do with your own property, after all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, are you ready to own some of that cheap life that everyone's been talking about? We offer volume discounts and free shipping on large orders. Who could possibly object to that?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
