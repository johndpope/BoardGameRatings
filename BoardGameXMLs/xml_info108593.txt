			<description>F1 ROC II: Race of Champions takes place in the not-so-distant future. The game is known in Japan as Exhaust Heat II - F-1 Driver no Kiseki (エキゾースト・ヒート Ｆ１ドライバーへの軌). During this time, open wheel car racing and NASCAR-style racing has melded together to become an elite racing circuit for the fastest, youngest, and most daring drivers of auto racing in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player must save money to enter races and to research better racing equipment. The player must go through the Group C division, Formula 3000, and eventually to Formula One. To accomplish this, the player must practice really hard and win all the races in a circuit. It all starts out with strange courses, but it eventually leads back to the familiar Formula One courses once the player has won all the Group C and Formula 3000 races. Once the player is in Formula One, he must choose one of three teams. Engines to choose from include Ford, Honda, and Ferrari.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to all this, the player must race all the courses in a certain order and can no longer choose the order in which to do those races. The Formula One portion of the game uses a season standings system in addition to keeping the times of individual races. The object of the game changes from simply winning the races to acquiring as many points as possible in order to win the championship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Banging up the car, frequently usage of the pit stop, and careless mistakes will destroy championship hopes just like in the real Formula One. Not even cheat codes can guarantee a top ranking in the overall standings, just winning individual races and utilizing strong overtaking moves while preserving the body and tires of the player's chosen vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game cartridge included a ST010 chip; a chip created by SETA for general functions and handling the intelligence of the computer cars. This chip offered unprecedented realism in the way that computer controlled-cars could perform aggressive manoeuvers with the speed and accuracy of real Formula One drivers. In addition to this, the chip allowed the game's artificial intelligence to perform tricks that were impossible to do with other racing video games released either during or before 1993.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only through the release of the PlayStation and the Nintendo 64 console systems did the level of artificial intelligence in the console system made this special chip obsolete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, recent research related to development of the bsnes emulator revealed that the chip was not used to a big extent in the game. It had space for storing 16384 instruction words, however, only 533 of them were actually programmed. It shows that the algorithms running on the ST010 were in fact very simple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;F1 ROC II: Race of Champions&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
