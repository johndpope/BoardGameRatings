			<description>ABXY is a competitive 2-player simultaneous action selection game.  Players use hand-picked teams of extraordinary creatures to battle until one player has no one left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn the game in 3 minutes, play a match in 5-15 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin a standard match with a team of creature cards and 4 button cards representing A, B, X, and Y actions.  A single creature card is the active combatant for each player while all others sit on the side awaiting use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All creatures in the game possess types, a weight, a passive ability, and a special action tied to one of the four button cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players secretly and simultaneously select a first and second action card.  Players reveal and resolve their first action and then reveal and resolve their second.  When directly contested actions occur, the lighter weight creature acts first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By default, the A action deals damage, the B action prevents damage and then deals damage back to the attacker, the X action switches out a player's active combatant for a different one, and the Y action prevents future blocking or takes control of an opponent's attempt to switch.  A creature's special action entirely replaces the default effect of one action button.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Types have no innate effect on gameplay (so players don't need to remember special rules based on types) but are sometimes referenced in passive abilities or special actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most important effect in the game is damage.  Rather than dealing with health totals, chits, dials, or dice, a creature is either damaged or it isn't.  When a creature becomes damaged, it is flipped over to its damaged side.  If a creature that is already damaged becomes damaged again, it is defeated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player's last creature has been defeated, so has that player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
