Tolkien's Middle-earth. It is suitable for those who have never played a fantasy role playing game, as well as more experienced gamers who are looking for a realistic, easy to play fantasy role playing (FRP) system designed for relatively low level adventurers (1st-10th levels). It contains complete rules for handling most of the common situations that arise in FRP games, and a variety of tables that add a great deal of flavor and detail to a game without decreasing playability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
