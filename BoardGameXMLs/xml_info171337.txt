							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paris Dakar</name>
									
			<description>A card game with 32 cards plus a rules card. The cards are illustrated with photographs from the famous annual rally from Paris to Dakar. There is also text on the cards which, if you read the cards from the first to the last, tells the story of participants. Finally, each card is numbered 1 to 32.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to collect sets of cards in numerical order (3,4,5 for example. All the cards are dealt out. In your turn you can ask any player for a card. If he has it, he passes it to the question player who can then ask for another card from the same or different players. When someone is asked for a card that he doesn't hold, the questioner's turn ends. Once sets of at least three cards are collected, they are laid face-down in front of the player, who may add to them during the rest of the game. The game ends when the last card has been played. The player with the most cards on the table, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
