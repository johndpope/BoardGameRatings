							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oh Cluck!</name>
									
			<description>Oh Cluck! is a Multiplayer card game where players assemble a Coop of Roosters, and challenge other players in light combat, amassing a basket of eggs. Game play supports 2-6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh Cluck! utilizes 2 decks; the Rooster Deck, and the Actions Deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rooster Deck is dealt out to players to build their coop of roosters, that act as the &amp;quot;Avatar&amp;quot; of the player. Unless card specifies otherwise, each player has a single rooster active at a given time. Each Rooster is worth a set amount of Eggs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Action deck consists of Attack, Dodge, Counter, Special, and Party Fowl card types, that allow players to interact with each other in an attempt to be the last Rooster standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a rooster is defeated, their eggs are added to the basket of the player that defeated them, and the rooster is replaced with another rooster from the coop. Play continues until there is only 1 player with rooster(s) left, or at the end of a turn, a player has amassed 1 dozen eggs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh Cluck uses light hearted slapstick humor, and mildly violent combat, reminescent of Looney Tunes, Tom and Jerry, etc...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
