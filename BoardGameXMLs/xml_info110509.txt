							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Das superschlaue Wörter-Krokodil</name>
									
			<description>The &amp;quot;word crocodile&amp;quot; gobbles up all words it finds in its path, but cannot digest them and gives them back again letter by letter. A non-playing referee slides a card into the crocodile. At the beginning only the tip of the crocodile&amp;rsquo;s tongue is visible and the first letter of the word. Now all players guess which word the crocodile is spitting out and call out words. Each player may only call out one word for each new letter, if you call out more than once you are disqualified for this word. If somebody manages to guess correctly, the card is shown to all players and is given to this player. The referee enters a new card. If the word was not guessed correctly after the first letter, the next letter is slid out and all guess again. If you do not want to guess you need not do so. If the word is not guessed before the last letter appears the card goes to the player who reads out the complete word first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the word a little picture clarifies and explains the meaning of the word and allows control if the guess was correct. The playing time can be varied by the number of cards used. When all cards have been played, the winner is the player who collected the majority of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
