			<description>At last, the Kotra rules are finished! These were gleaned from what little information there was in the DS9 episode &amp;quot;Empok Nor&amp;quot;, as well as production notes, and the script. The rules are derived from chess and stratego, since the script described the game as being a cross between the two. Other elements, like the use of dice, were gleaned from scenes in the episode. The board design and markings are based on the fabulous concept art by John Eaves, but the rules and gameplay are mine, please do not claim them as your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
