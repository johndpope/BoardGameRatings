							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Villtur Sveldt: The Wildlands</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wild Lands, ruled by no man, encompass an area nearly as large as all the civilized lands of Ropa. Within it live unknown peoples, fell creatures and deadly dangers. It is rumored that the Wild Lands were once civilized, one of many rumors about the region. It is known to be home to several barbaric human tribes, numerous humanoid tribes and a few frontier outposts. Numerous barbarian raids are made each year into neighboring kingdoms including sea raids and piracy. A brave or foolhardy few have been known to penetrate the Wild Lands attempting to wrest wealth or weal from it. Most never return. Smugglers sometimes use the coast lands for their operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are six border outposts guarding against incursions from this untamed country. Quirtoy maintains one, but it is suspected it is used as much to raid into the Wild Lands for &amp;quot;specimens&amp;quot; as it is for defense. The three forts that The Cudgel maintains also foray into the Wild Lands, but their purpose is for slaves and army conscripts. Edda's border is unguarded, the Eddans relying on their mobility to deter and thwart barbarian raids. Prissia and Venicia also each maintain an outpost simply protecting the integrity of their borders. From north to south, these fortifications are named Kara Akbaba'nın Aerie (Vulture's Aerie), A Kalap&amp;aacute;cs (The Hammer), A Koh&amp;oacute; (The Forge), Az &amp;Uuml;llő (The Anvil), Bearden and Avamposto Solitario (Lone Outpost).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
