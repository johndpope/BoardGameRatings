			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a full-color, 48 x 30 Battlemap of a Hangar Bay, with Hex, Square and No Overlays. The Zip file contains a 360 degree view from the centre of the bay and also includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is your captain. The ship is lost. Grab whatever supplies you can and get out of here. Escape and survive, that is my final order. &amp;ldquo;&amp;mdash;Starship Captain Globel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Sounds of a door smashing, followed by screams, then dead comms.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hangar 1A is a single level interior map of two hangar hatches for fighters or other small ships. There is an upper level walkway along the north and east wall with the main personnel door entrance in the north center with secondary doors in the northwest part of the walkway and just to the east of the main entrance. There are two force fielded hangar door exits in the south wall. Hangar 1A includes a 360-degree panoramic view from the center of the hangar bay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hangar 1A is intended for use in near or far-future Science Fiction games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breached from Within:  Aliens have boarded your starship and breached the bridge. The bridge crew is captured or killed with communications down. Your orders are to gather supplies into the ships and escape the hangar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But as the player characters gather supplies and get them inside the escape vessels, the access door from the ship to the hangar is breached and aliens enter the room from the walkway above. It&amp;rsquo;s up to them to decide to try and fight the aliens to buy time to gather more supplies or make a run for it quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After getting out of the hangar, the player character&amp;rsquo;s escape ship has to evade or fight the alien starship&amp;rsquo;s fighters to get away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure hook makes for a good way to launch a campaign as this explains how the group got their initial starting ship as well as establishing a campaign villainous alien race. The choice to gather supplies or not may also lead to a desperate need to get supplies soon after their escape leading to further adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
