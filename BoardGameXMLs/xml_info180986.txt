			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago the gods and primordials fought a war on an unfathomable scale, and in the end both lost. The world and heavens were shattered, as were the metaphysical barriers that separated the rest of the planes. This was the Sundering, a cosmic cataclysm that annihilated most of what had been wrought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Legion was one such creation that survived, an army of machines constructed specifically to fight and conquer. They weren&amp;rsquo;t activated during the war, and remained sealed away in a sentient armory until long after the tremors of the Sundering ceased. Once the armory determined that the progeny of the gods had also survived the Sundering, it activated and set them loose upon the Remnants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Primordial Machine is an introductory adventure that gives you a glimpse into A Sundered World, an upcoming campaign setting for Dungeon World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One way or another, the characters arrive on an island harboring a Legion hive, and must destroy them before they can complete construction of a new primordial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product comes with both color and black and white pdfs, in case you want to save yourself some ink printing it yourself (or just prefer black and white).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, it includes previews for four of the six new classes: the battlemind, nomad, shaman, and warlock. A separate pdf contains letter-sized character sheets for each, and there's enough advanced moves to play each of them up until about 6th-level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
