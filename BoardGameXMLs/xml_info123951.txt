			<description>This amusing little two-player game can be enjoyed by young and old alike. All that is required is a 7 x 7 squared grid, four playing pieces per player, and a die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pieces start in the positions as shown in the diagram (squares 0 and X) and the object is to manoeuvre the pieces so as to occupy two opposite centre squares (A-A or B-B in diagram).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move in turn according to the roll of the die as follows:&lt;br/&gt;1 or 4 = 1 square,&lt;br/&gt;2 or 5 = 2 squares&lt;br/&gt;3 or 6 = 3 squares&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is only allowed in a vertical or horizontal direction. It is not permissible to occupy the centre square, nor is one able to jump over another piece. Also only one piece can occupy any one square and it is obligatory to move the full number of squares if possible. The highlight of the game occurs when a piece lands upon a square occupied by an enemy piece. The owner of the moving piece must shout in a clear, loud voice the word &amp;quot;Clobber&amp;quot;. Having complied with that rule, he may remove the enemy piece and replace it anywhere on the board that he wishes, preferably as far from its target as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This quick, simple game is well worth a try, it can become quite compulsive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
