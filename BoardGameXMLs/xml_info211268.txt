			<description>You just can&amp;rsquo;t get enough, can you? Let&amp;rsquo;s invite more people to join in. Do you think your friends are game? Let&amp;rsquo;s watch them make asses of themselves. Take pics. Post publicly. Tease mercilessly. Look cool. Warning: Watch Ya Mouth NSFW Expansion Pack #3 is not responsible for any social media beefs. #SorryNotSorry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch Ya&amp;rsquo; Mouth, The Original Mouthguard Party Game, is authentic and hilarious. Often imitated, never duplicated.&lt;br/&gt;3-10 players&lt;br/&gt;Hampered by cheek retractors, teams attempt to read and interpret silly phrases, like:&lt;br/&gt;Wonder Woman wears super panties.&lt;br/&gt;The brew pub is in the village.&lt;br/&gt;My husband wears a mankini for fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch Ya Mouth NSFW Expansion Pack #3 comes with 155 depraved, explicit phrase cards and 6 blanks (161 total cards). Our cards are strong, thick, and durable for years of hysterics and beer spills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
