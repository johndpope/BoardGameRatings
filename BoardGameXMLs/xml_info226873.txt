							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Starmada Unity Rulebook</name>
									
			<description>The Unity Rulebook represents what we expect will become the definitive version of a game that has gone through several updates over more than two decades. In that time, players around the world have grown to love Starmada for its shallow learning curve, depth of experience, and ease of play, even as they differ over which release represents the One True Vision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this edition, designated PROJECT UNITY, was to draw from the best parts of each incarnation of the game, from the Compendium and Starmada X, through the Admiralty Edition and 2012's Nova Rulebook, and unify those concepts in a way that allows experienced starship captains to continue enjoying the game they love while drawing new players into the fold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long-time players will be thrilled to learn there is no need to convert existing starship designs to this new edition: comprehensive rules are included which allow players to use both Admiralty and Nova ship display sheets with a minimum of modification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the release of the Unity Rulebook, we hope to revitalize the game and introduce the thrills of tabletop battles in deep space to a whole new generation. The Universal Game of Starship Combat is back, and better than ever!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
