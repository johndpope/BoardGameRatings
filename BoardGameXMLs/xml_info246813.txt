			<description>The National Bank has hidden a load of money in one of four possible locations &amp;mdash; but you have the time to rob only one! Will you be smarter than the other players and pull off the heist of the century?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Takers, players have five criminal cards from potentially four different locations in hand and will be able to play one per turn. Each gang is the best at robbing one place, is the second best at robbing another, and can't rob the remaining two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, the four location cards are placed face down and one is put aside: it will be the place that will be robbed. On their turn, players can look at an incorrect location card to get info on the right one, but then they have to discard a card, having only four in hand until the end of the game, although maybe they will be able to play their cards for powers, allowing them to take back discarded cards, draw a card, then discard one,...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They can also chose to flip a jewel token. When all the jewel tokens matching the player colors have been placed face up, the game ends and players get points depending on what kind of criminals they have remaining in their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
