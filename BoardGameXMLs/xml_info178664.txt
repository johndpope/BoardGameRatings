			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An overgrown cloister. The outlandish thicket in which it stands springs from walls encrusted with blooms of crystal, phenomena studied by an order ensconced within. They too are transforming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Condensed to one page for slipping in among other materials, this sandbox-oriented content is intended as an easily absorbed framework for improvisation to be adapted by the user as preferred for a wider setting and specific system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It presents core ideas and key numbers to fall back on, with general approaches that can be applied in other situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The content covers map generation on the fly for an abstracted cloister as well as suggestions for aspects of the locality, including growths, occupants, rooms, volumes and physical changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A possible source for the phyme is given in For the Tears of Stars are in Full Flood. The cloister could be simplified or extended using map elements from Landscape: The Manse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
