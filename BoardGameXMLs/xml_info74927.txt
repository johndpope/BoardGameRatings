			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Into the Future: Derelict Starships, Tabletop Adventures&amp;rsquo; book designed to help you, the GM, bring those dead spaceships to life. Here you have a whole book of descriptions that can assist you in providing the images and experience of being in a derelict starship, building apprehension for your players with each step as their characters explore the unknown. These pieces do not answer the question of why a ship has become a derelict. Instead they are designed to augment your own campaign and game plans without taking your story a completely different direction from where you wanted it to go. These are for all those places in the ship that are not key to the story. Think of it as camouflage to avoid the &amp;quot;Cunning Player Syndrome&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Oh, if the GM took time to explain this it must be a trap...we draw our Type 75 super-duper dual phase laser cannon and sweep the area.&amp;quot; Now you have descriptions for items and damage that are just what they appear to be- or maybe a bit more. Damage that, while it may be dangerous (as being in any wrecked ship or house might be), is merely damage to the ship and nothing more. Some descriptions are creepy or may cause characters to go &amp;quot;ewwww,&amp;quot; while others may be humorous, but the overall effect should be to ramp up the tension in your players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These written pieces range from descriptions of specific places like the ship&amp;rsquo;s bridge, hydroponics, gun turrets, observation decks, crew quarters, and so on to small &amp;quot;bits&amp;quot; of description that can be used anywhere: wires and conduits that have broken loose from their fastenings and spill into a room or corridor, damaged control and interface panels, dead bodies, and much, much more&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
