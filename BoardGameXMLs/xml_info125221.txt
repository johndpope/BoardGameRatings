							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Desert Temple</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here a massive structure rises from the sand covering the land from horizon to horizon. Massive blocks of sandstone form this temples foundation and the stone slabs making up its door frames are no less impressive. Most of its walls though have been constructed from much smaller stone blocks and the hollow space between inner and outer walls has been filled with sand and gravel. The temples only gate to the outside, set in the massive front wall rising to a height of almost 60 feet, is curiously open. Anyone with business at the temple is admitted into the first courtyard, where they are tended by the priests in the shade of the partial roof and the columns supporting them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inner courtyard though is separated from the first one by another impressive wall with an equally impressive gate of hard wood and brass. Columns supporting a partial stone roof provide shade for the priests and attendants resting here. Yet another massive gate leads into, what anyone not knowing better must take for the temples sanctuary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a matter of fact this windowless room only lit by two lanterns is only an anteroom for the actual sanctuary and the priests' quarters below ground where they are isolated from the blazing heat of the day by a thick layer of sand. A wide ramp leads down to a gate of stone without any apparent means of opening where only the initiates of the temple are admitted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
