							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stellar Conflicts &amp; Uprisings</name>
									
			<description>The ground combat companion to Tactical Command Games' spaceship combat Rules Stellar Fire, Stellar Conflicts &amp;amp; Uprisings takes the same game concepts and applies them to squad and platoon level infantry combat (but can be played up to company level).  Includes rules for vehicles, engineer support, and artillery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SC&amp;amp;U uses hidden counter movement, spotting attempts and simultaneous combat rules designed to keep all players involved and active during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like Stellar Fire, SC&amp;amp;U's rich universe with 5 alien races and three human factions are used by an included scenario generator to create a endless amount of interesting game setups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
