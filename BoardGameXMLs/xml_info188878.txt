			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Entry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         This RPG item was a submission to the #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge.  It was developed by three different designers in a randomized, anonymous fashion.  For details, and for information on how the versions are structured, see the series RPGGeek entry here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge 2015. All of the entries are available here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Winners and Everything&lt;br/&gt;Entry #153; Stage One: Vivian Abraham; Stage Two: Joe Wasson; Stage Three: Ella McConnell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are all students at a school for witches and wizards.  First and second period is Double Potions.  Will you get into trouble in class?  Will you be sent to the nurse&amp;rsquo;s office?  Or will you work together to successfully create a magical potion?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potions are not to be taken lightly. They are among the most powerful magic that exists. You may think that it&amp;rsquo;s fun to create a little fart juice for your fourth period magical animal taming or a sneaking syrup to get past the hall monitor but potions have been the cause of almost every major incident in wizarding history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewing potions is dangerous business. When the magical essence of something as small as a cucumber seed is release in the wrong way it can have disastrous consequences, so I expect you all to behave and focus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Double Potions is a game for 2 to 6 players. You will need a handful of six-sided dice, a bunch (about 10) of tokens in each of four colors and an opaque bag. You will also need your wits as Double Potions is a game as much about improv as it is about rolling dice. Oh, and it&amp;rsquo;s also about potions, but only mildly so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
