							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">HARP: The Codex</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Aye,&amp;quot; the bartender agreed, &amp;quot;I know of da magics you'll need to confront such a beast, and I know of one that can teach them to ya as well. Just head nort' out of town and about a mile or so along you'll come to a trail 'tween a couple of fields, headin' to the west. Go on down that trail and you'll soon see a small cottage, all fenced in right prettily. Announce yerself loudly before you even think o' climbing Myrhal's fence. He doesn't take kindly to tresspassers and if you cross dat fence without permission, I doubt you'll need to worry about that beast no more. Anyways, when he answers your hail, make sure to let him know that you was sent by a Friend of Otto, and he'll give you the aid you seek. Don't forget now, make sure to mention that you was sent by a Friend of Otto, else wise you are likely to be in a world of hurt.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With those words, the bartender turned back to his work, refusing to answer any more of the group's questions, not even how he knew about the beast that they needed to confront in their search for the Codex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The HARP Codex is a book of magic. In its pages you will find lots of magic that can be used to expand the depth and breadth of magic in your game. You get dozens and dozens of all new spells along with ruels for allowing players to learn spells through membership in Guilds rather than fixed professions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the Codex brings you 4 all new professions, to allow you to expand your game in all new directions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventurer - a jack-of-all-trades, able to round out any group and provide solid support. &lt;br/&gt;Druid - a nature priest who incorporates all aspects of nature; animal, vegetable, and even a bit of the elemental. &lt;br/&gt;Mystic - he is the epitome of mental control, for both his own mind and the minds of others. &lt;br/&gt;Shadowblade - a true night person, the darkness is his element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
