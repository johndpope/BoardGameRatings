			<description>Nevermoor is a tabletop miniature adventure/skirmish game. Players take control of a party of characters and fight through the deadly streets of Nevermoor to save the city from certain doom.&lt;br/&gt;The Miniatures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nevermoor utilizes 40mm pewter cast miniatures to represent the various characters within the game world. Each miniature is created with a mixture of hand sculpting and 3d modeling to create a true to life scale. Each character is designed by Creative Director, David Tepfer in a variety of poses and varying equipment to give each party (no matter the guild) a unique look. Initial designs, artwork, and sculpt pictures can all be found in the &amp;ldquo;Guild Models&amp;rdquo; section of this website.&lt;br/&gt;The Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nevermoor is a small scale miniature game. Each party only consists of five models which are divided into one of three party roles:  Leader, Striker, or Tank. The small scale nature of the game allows for truly deep character construction. Each character can purchase upgrades throughout the game, gaining new attacks, skill, and equipment. All of this makes a perfectly paced game whose action slowly increases until it reaches its breaking point in the final few turns!&lt;br/&gt;The World&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The King of Nevermoor has gone mad! A mythic plague has taken hold of the city and corrupted the minds and bodies of its citizens. The plague is revered as a gift of the gods by the infected and turned these deformed monsters into &amp;ldquo;holy&amp;rdquo; zealots. In his madness, the King has sealed off the city to cleanse the uninfected. The city&amp;rsquo;s remaining guilds have taken to the streets in attempt to liberate the city but the mass hysteria and rioting has turned the city into a war zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tabletop is packed with buildings, winding streets, and claustrophobic alleys. This unique layout makes playing Nevermoor feel like a massive game of cat and mouse. Hidden traps and ambushes are favored to the open fight in Nevermoor; favoring the clever planner over the brute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
