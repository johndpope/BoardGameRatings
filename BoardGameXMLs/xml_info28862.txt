			<description>(From Box Back)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;An exciting game of word perception combined with cash accumulation for 3-6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Players buy letters to reveal a hidden crossword puzzle. The player who has acquired the most money when the crossword is complete is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The player must decide whether or not to go ahead and reveal the hidden letter. To guess the amount correctly would mean an immediate cash payment. It could also expose an important clue to the rest of the word, thereby leading to further payment for each correct letter and also the possibility of a word bonus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Or alternatively, the turn could be sold to another player who has offered a large cash sum to take it over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Be very careful... some of the words are not as obvious as they appear!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
