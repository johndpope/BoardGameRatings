			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob sat back in his seat and closed his eyes as he tried to tune out the world. The last few days had been non-stop and it was nice to know that he would have a couple quiet weeks to himself. He sunk deeper into the heated first-class seat and raised the crystal glass filled with champagne to his lips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As he was about to take a sip, the curtain separating first class and coach was thrown open and a voice shattered his tranqility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is my plane now. Do as I say and no one will be hurt!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where do you go from here? To the battle map, of course! If you need a map of a modern structure, you need Modern Floorplans. The Modern Floorplans series from Fabled Environments and 12 to Midnight offers gamers high quality maps in a variety of configurations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Want to draw it out yourself? Use the 8.5&amp;times;11 map as a guide.&lt;br/&gt;     Want to simply drop the map on the table and play? Use either the 24&amp;times;36 full map (if you have access to a plotter printer) or print the tiled version on regular paper and assemble a full-size version yourself in a matter of minutes. Both versions are scaled at 1 inch equals 5 feet.&lt;br/&gt;     In addition, each floorplan also comes in versions without room labels and without furniture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: All floorplans are rendered in black and white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonus: Bundled with this map is In the Shadow of the Cross, part four in a series of serialized short fiction featuring hardboiled occult investigator &amp;quot;Jacob&amp;quot; in settings taken straight from Modern Floorplans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All maps are created by an architectural drafter using AutoCAD. This gives all of the maps the realistic feel that your players crave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map Descriptions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map is actually two separate passenger jets each complete with separate maps detailing the plane's cargo area. One plane is a 156 passenger Jumbo Jet sporting 12 first class seats. The other is 56 passenger jet designed as a short haul aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hope that you enjoy both of these aircraft!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
