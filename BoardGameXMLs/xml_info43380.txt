							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gronewold Demolition</name>
									
			<description>The object of the game is to raze and remove an eight story building of ones' opponent, and be reimbursed by City Hall for the completed demolition work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is given a square on the board and 32 colored blocks.  Each constructs an eight story building using all of the blocks within the designated area on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Die rolls determine which draw deck one takes cards from, and whether that player also gets an additional turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The orange, yellow, and green card stacks each function differently and help to determine actions taken by that player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After one of the players has removed all of the blocks from his or her building, the game ends.  The total of cash on hand and cards from the orange stack (contract cards) determine the winning player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
