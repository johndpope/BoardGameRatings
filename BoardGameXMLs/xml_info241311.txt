			<description>The time has come to prepare for battle, as Upper Deck Entertainment Introduces World of Warcraft &amp;quot;Drums of War- PVP Battle Decks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The thundering drums of war echo throughout the land of Kalimdor. New warlords ride through the gates of Orgrimmar, eager to serve the warchief and leave their marks on the pages of history.&lt;br/&gt;Small battalions of Alliance soldiers arrive at outposts throughout Azeroth.&lt;br/&gt;They solidify their footholds in contested areas as marshals draw up strategies to defend their territories and press any aggressors who foolishly cross their paths.&lt;br/&gt;It is only a matter of time until the piercing battle cries, roaring magic, and crashing steel evoke the symphony of war once again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the dust settles, will you be remembered, or will you fade into oblivion?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Call to Arms!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
