							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legends of the Ancient World: Shadows in the Dark</name>
									
			<description>Shadows in the Dark is a pre-programmed, paragraph-based adventure in the Legends of the Ancient World series by Dark City Games. The game includes an adventure book (which contains the story and the rules), game counters, and a map used to resolve combat. Players create and customize their characters, follow the adventure making decisions that will influence the course of the story, and use map and game counters to resolve combat against the enemies that will be encountered along the way. The game can be played by a single player, as a choose-your-adventure book with a more tactical combat system behind, or by a group of up to 4 players working together in an RPG experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the rim of the explored world lies a volatile land known as The Frontier. Horrific beasts born of nightmare appear out of thin air, devouring any living thing in their path. The weather and landscape too, are capricious and unpredictable. A scalding day may be replaced in a matter of moments by a raging blizzard. Where there was a verdant forest a day ago, now may be a vast desert. Now you are tasked to recover a stolen idol, a trinket, seemingly of minimum value. But Saleeb, the merchant prince, wants it back and is willing to pay a hefty fee. The only problem is that the trail of the idol goes deep into the uncharted regions of The Frontier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
