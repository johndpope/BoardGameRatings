			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marco Volo - Arrival is the third and last volume of the Marco Volo trilogy, designed for four to eight player characters of 6th-8th level. When the characters first set off on an intrigue-laden journey to Shadowdale, they did not suspect how much trouble they would get into. Joined by Marcus Wands (also known as &amp;quot;Marco Volo&amp;quot;), they found him just a bothersome but likeable little rogue. No one suspected he was on the run from the crazy wizard Sabbar. The troublesome Marcus had previously stolen from him a rare artifact called the Dragonking's Eye, and hid it in the Spiderhaunt Woods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the party approaches the Spiderhaunts, and Marcus insists on diverting the group to retrieve the Eye. But strange things have been happening there. There are rumors: of an oddly constructed keep of bone (or is it crystal?); of a warlord out for conquest (or is it a lich?); of goblin tribes strangely clad, and extra-planar beings banding with the giant spiders of the aptly named Spiderhaunt Woods. Something evil has denned at the heart of the forest. It has a mind of its own....and it has plans for Faer&amp;ucirc;n.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last volume of the Marco Volo trilogy gives a DM the tools to run this free-wheeling, fast-paced adventure, and the secrets of the powers at work behind the scenes. The player characters must face - and deal with - the mad wizard Sabbar, the annoyed Volothamp Geddarm (who wants to have &amp;quot;a little chat&amp;quot; with Marcus!), and ultimately the Dragonking's Eye itself. Even the gods themselves step in to have their say. In a dramatic denouement, this epic adventure draws to a close, but the memory of what transpired will live on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
