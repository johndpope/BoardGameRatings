							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dark Crystal Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Each player selects a color (publically announced) and then the entire deck is shuffled and each player is dealt four cards from the deck (they may get cards of their own color, they may get cards of their opponent's colors).  On your turn, you draw a card from the pile and then place a card onto the board.  The card placed on the board must match the card/illustration of the card it is placed onto (cards feature illustrations of characters, creatures and objects from The Dark Crystal).  The cards all have values of 1, 2, 3 and 5 on them.  When a &amp;quot;Sun&amp;quot; card is played (on a player's turn), all visible cards are scored per suit/color (the &amp;quot;Sun&amp;quot; card may also be countered by a &amp;quot;Stop Sun&amp;quot; card).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until the last card from the deck is drawn and then there is a final scoring round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
