							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Subterranean Oceans of Argos Prime</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dawn Adventures 1: The Subterranean Oceans of Argos Prime is the first in a set of adventures by Gypsy Knights Games set in the colonies of the Dawn subsector of Tranquility Sector, located to trailing of Clement Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the fringes of colonized space, settlers struggle on recently discovered worlds for land to call their own.  One such planet is Argos Prime, where the dangers of a new world are in contrast to the world's unique natural beauty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The crew of CCA-336 have been asked by thier superiors in the Cascadia Colonization Authority to go to Argos Prime to survey the world for a possible expansion of the colony.  Can they survive the natural dangers, angry locals, and maneuver through local politics as well?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dawn Adventures 1: The Subterranean Oceans of Argos Prime is an exciting adventure filled with danger and intrigue.  It comes with nine pre-generated characters, tons of NPCs and a bestiary of local creatures.  The adventure also features stats and deckplans for CCA-336, a Trailblazer-class ship used by the CCA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although Dawn Adventures 1: The Subterranean Oceans of Argos Prime can be modified for use in any Traveller setting, it is recommended that Referees have access to Clement Sector, our core setting book, to make full use of this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all our products, the main intention of this book is to provide an extra spark to the Referee's imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
