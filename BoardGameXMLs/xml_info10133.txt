			<description>In this Roll and Move game, players try to be the first to reach the gold mine at the top of the mountain. However, as they progress, prospectors can be randomly sent back down by the Rattler! mechanical device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a thrilling journey to the Lost Gold Mine in this suspense-filled game.  Move your prospector up the mountain trail, but beware.  There's a rattler inside the mountain, and when you hear the hiss, you'll know he's ready to strike.  If the rattler strikes through the door, you'll have to go back to start.  The first player to get his prospector to the Lost Gold Mine at the top of the mountain wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
