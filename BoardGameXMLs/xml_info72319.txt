			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stuff of nightmares is now the stuff of role-playing. &lt;br/&gt;If you have have ever watched a horror film and thought that the characters were so dumb that they deserved all they got, then here is your chance to prove that you could do better!&lt;br/&gt;Why should the masked lunatics have all the fun? Why not carve a niche for yourself in the annals of horrordom?&lt;br/&gt;BLOOD! offers you the chance to do just that! Whith a comprehensive set of rules you can now re-enact any modern horror film, be it a stalk-and-slash, spatterfest, zombie-bash, gothic haunting or cannibal gut-muncher. With combat tables detailing damage for almost any kind of weapon (razors, chainsaws, powertools and dissolving to name a few), plus over 400 different weapons (household and garden implements not forgotten) you'll find that there is plenty of room for messy misadventures. Serious horror fans will not be disappointed by some of the most gruesome illustrations and scenarios on the market. Included also in this rulebook are rules for character creation and classes, skills, combat, poisons, disease, insanities, blood loss and a smattering of monsters.&lt;br/&gt;The introductory scenarios &amp;quot;When Meat is Murder&amp;quot; an &amp;quot;A Mere Interlude&amp;quot; should really get the juices flowing!&lt;br/&gt;And don't forget... make it moist!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
