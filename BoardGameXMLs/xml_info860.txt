			<description>from Consimworld:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Situation&lt;br/&gt;There is no greater hero in Scottish history than William Wallace. In 1297 he began what grew into the Scottish Rebellion. The death of his wife at the hands of the English launched Wallace on a quest to expel them from Scotland. Unlike other leaders in the rebellion, Wallace never betrayed his country, his comrades or his cause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game&lt;br/&gt;SCOTLAND THE BRAVE is based on the opening of the Scottish War for Independence. Beginning with the revolt of a minor land owner named William Wallace in 1297, it culminated in the victory of Robert the Bruce in 1315 at Bannockburn. SCOTLAND THE BRAVE simulates the first two years of the conflict in which William Wallace was the dominant figure. Players take the place of either William Wallace or King Edward of England as each attempts to gain the assistance of Scottish nobles and control of southern Scotland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCOTLAND THE BRAVE originally appeared in issue no. 49 of Shadis Magazine. This Avalanche Press Edition features different components, complete with mounted mapsheet, and new rules. This is a fast-playing game which can be learned and played in a single sitting. Battle is a means to an end, with control of the towns the key to winning. Introducing randomness in the form of Strategy Markers adds a bit of spice. The game system is loosely modeled on the HOUSE DIVIDED game system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
