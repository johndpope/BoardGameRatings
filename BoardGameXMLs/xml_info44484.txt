			<description>Down the Hatch is a drinking game (like many other games from this publisher) in which players move around a board with aspects of both Sorry! and Monopoly. Pieces represent ships and as the players move around the board, they draw cards relating to getting drinks on shore leave. Squares on the board and cards instruct players how many drinks to take. The first player to return all of his ships to the port is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
