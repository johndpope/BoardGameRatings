			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to GARY LINEKER'S SUPERSTAR SOCCER, the most exciting soccer simulation yet! Passes, dribbling, injuries - GARY LINEKER'S SUPERSTAR SOCCER packs in all the realism and excitement of real outdoor soccer, combining the hectic demands of team management and coaching with the talent needed to be a 'Star Striker!'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's YOUR team and it's your goal to turn it into championship material ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Soccer game. The original Commodore 64 version has very light management, with the player only having the option to make coaching decisions in-game. The Spectrum and Amstrad versions have considerably more management options between games, with the ability to buy and sell players as well as to spend money on training your team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing a game, the option is given whether to play or not, and / or whether to Coach or not. It is possible to set both playing and coaching to &amp;quot;Computer&amp;quot; if you wish to simply observe the results of your management skills. In the Commodore 64 version only, a second player can be set to play the opposing team. In addition, if the user decides to play the match, they have a choice in the Commodore version to either play the Goalkeeper only, or the other players on the pitch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
