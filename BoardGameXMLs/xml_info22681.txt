			<description>AtomMate is a chemistry card game that consists of a deck of 49 playing-size cards with the names, symbols and facts about the elements of the Periodic Table. It is used to play games that involve making chemical compounds. Designed for students aged 10 and up, it is a grow-with-me game. Beginning students learn the names and symbols of the elements. Intermediate students learn to combine the elements to form molecules and compounds. More advanced students can use the cards to enhance their understanding of simple reactions. Instructions for eight easy games, which range in difficulty from easy to complex, are included. There are several games that may be played with these cards. All games are designed for 2 to 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
