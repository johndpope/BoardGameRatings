Just choose from one of the six unique flavors, press go, and presto! Instant dungeon will instantly create a new dungeon just for you! Complete with glittering treasures, vicious monsters, brutal boss battles, wild power ups and most importantly fun, Fun, FUN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instant Dungeon! mixes dungeon exploration with arcade action in the vein of the classic maze games from the 80s (eg.
