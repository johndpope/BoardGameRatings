							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Navy Strike</name>
									
			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strap yourself into the cockpit of an F18 and catapult yourself into Navy Strike, featuring the latest in 3D graphics and AI technology to bring the world of supersonic combat to your computer screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take on the role of a Task Force Commander and immerse yourself in the world of high-tech naval warfare. Experience the thrill of planning an entire aerial campaign and bringing your strategy to fruition. Perform reconnaissance, escort, interception and strike duties against airfields, cities, oil installations, industrial centres and enemy HQ's. Maintain and protect international exclusion zones by intercepting enemy aircraft and, if necessary, engaging them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With true 3D, image mapped, SVGA graphics, you can view your aircraft and cockpit from any angle you choose using the unique Rowan View Matrix (RVM). With fixed enemy lock, multiple external camera positions and an explosive ordinance view you will always be one step ahead, behind or even beside the action. Facing the most intelligent computer controlled opponents ever seen in a flight simulator, you'll be glad of the latest HUD technology, automated targeting systems and photo-realistic cockpits, all based on real military hardware. Select the right aircraft for the job, choose from: F22N, the &amp;quot;Air Superiority Fighter&amp;quot; with supercruise. FA18E, the stretched hornet with increased ordinance capacity. AX, the futuristic stealth &amp;quot;Flying Wing&amp;quot; bomber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With super-realistic sound effects and details such as sun glare, black-outs, scientifically accurate flight dynamics and real world military flight scenarios you'll find it hard to keep your feet on the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
