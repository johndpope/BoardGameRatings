			<description>Fishery is an abstract strategy game in which 2 players place ships and cast nets, each trying to have the largest area in their fisheries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MATERIALS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameboard (7&amp;times;9 grid)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;12 Ship pieces (6 white, 6 black)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;60 Net pieces (sticks: 30 white, 30 black)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETUP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameboard starts empty. Each player selects a color, and Black goes first. Players alternate turns during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 1: Place Ships&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, place 1 of your ships in an empty square space on the gameboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all 12 ships are on the gameboard, continue to the next phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 2: Place Nets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, either place a net on one of the net spaces between the squares according to the rules below, or pass:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. A fishery is an area completely surrounded by nets, including the pre-printed blue nets at the edge of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Each fishery must contain at least one ship, but not necessarily your own ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Each fishery must use at least one of the pre-printed blue nets at the edge of the board as part of its border.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;END OF THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If both players pass consecutively, the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCORING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each fishery, the player with more ships in it controls that fishery, and scores 1 fish for each square space in it, including the spaces with ships. If both players have the same number of ships in a fishery, neither player controls that fishery, and neither gets the fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most fish wins! In the event of a tie, the second player (White) wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
