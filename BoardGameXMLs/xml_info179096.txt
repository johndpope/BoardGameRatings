							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Book and the Law</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Book and the Law: The (now former) Outlaws have settled into their lives as rich folk in a settled town. They've even each become an important personage of their town, one of the movers-and-shakers. And it starts to look like this is how they're going to be whiling away their latter years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only, while the Law has cleaned up just about all of the old gangs of the West, a couple of young and much more violent gangs have risen up to take their place, and one of those gangs starts ridin' into the Outlaws' adopted town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, the Outlaws have to decide if they want to intervene. But if'n they do, they're likely to be exposed as the outlaws that they are. Which is especially true after a few of the townsfolk call in a marshal to help rid their god-fearin' town of this vile gang. However, if the Outlaws don't intervene, then the plans of this marshal seem all too likely to see the town shot to hell and back. Not to mention, all the gunplay might attract the scrutiny of the Law, which could see them exposed anyways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Which leaves the Outlaws between a rock and a hard place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
