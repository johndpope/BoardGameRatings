The computer assumes the role of Darth Vadar, Chief Bad Buy.  The Millennium Falcon must reach a goal - Yavin-4 - before the evil force personified by Darth Vadar can destroy it and its occupants.  The fate of the entire galaxy hinges on the successful completion of this mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STARWARS was written by Thomas N. Ronayne and published as a type-in BASIC program in Creative Computing Vol. 4, No. 5, September/October 1978.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
