			<description>Enter Horsetropolis, a future where no humans remain and an aristocratic overclass of psychic horses rule. These merciless overlords send their mind-controlled horse minions to feed, breed, and conquer - until only one Stable remains!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was designed live at the Penny Arcade Expo (PAX) Australia 2017, during the &amp;quot;Let's Make a Board Game - Live!&amp;quot; panel. 'Unstable' (also 'Foal Play' and various other equestrian puns) was created on audience suggestions (horses, unstable relationships, mind control, area control, 'Animal Farm') and then condensed into a tabletop board game to be added to the PAX Aus Tabletop Library (and in print-and-play through BGG).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Unstable, a game for 2-4 players, players split into two teams. Each turn, players all draw one Hay, Water and Equus (Love) card. They then draw an additional card of any type matching a territory they control. Each of these card types has one of four actions on it (Breed, Attack, Gallop or &amp;quot;Turn into Glue&amp;quot;). After drawing, and without being allowed to speak to each other, players place up to three cards facedown in front of them and then reveal and action those cards one at a time. If teammates both reveal the same action, they get a bonus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, you must mind-meld with your partner, control the board, and collect up to 20 horseshoes to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
