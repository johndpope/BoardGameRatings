			<description>Be the first bringing your meeples 'home'; get as many bonus points as possible.&lt;br/&gt;- moving by turns -&lt;br/&gt;Depending on no. of participants each player draws (movement) cards and gets 6 meeples; during your race you have to overcome obstacles, other meeples by drawing &amp;amp; playing 'appropiate' cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card offers 3 movement points, which have to be allocated on listed meeples (numbered 1-6). If you see a double or triple number you have to move this meeple, only. In front of an obstacle or another meeple you are forced to play such cards, otherwise you are blocked and your movement is forfeited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on your position your meeple entered the finish zone you gain bonus points. Player/team with most bonus points is the winner. Two teams are formed if more than 2 players participate. &lt;br/&gt; Notes:&lt;br/&gt;Likely published during 1930's&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
