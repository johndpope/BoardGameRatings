			<description>Centuries is a card drafting, deck building card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking place during the turbulent but exciting Renaissance, players take on the role of a leader of a city of Renaissance Europe.  Players try to construct a Major Construction within their city, collect resources, expand the their treasuries, enlarge armies, develop technology, build structures, establish trade, and colonize the world, sometimes with the help of notables like Leonardo DaVinci or Queen Elizabeth.  Be the Leader who exceeds what other Leaders can do and become victorious!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Played in three Centuries, players collect resource cards in order to afford other cards that in turn award the player with victory points.  A key mechanic involves deciding which cards to pass to the other Players and which to keep in a modest supply deck.  Modular in nature, Players can play from 3 - 6 modules.  With the 3 module game, a fun and fairly short game can be enjoyed even by novice players.  With the full game, Players enjoy a challenging game that will stretch the skills of the most hardened strategist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are lavishly decorated with the great works of art from the Renaissance and can be played in multiple ways:  either in a basic manner or with an added bonus, played to build the major construction, passed, kept to enlarge the supply deck, or discarded for money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Centuries is a fast-paced, strategy card game with limitless replayability with no game playing exactly the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
