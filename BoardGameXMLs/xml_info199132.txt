			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;Eat or Eaten is a two-player abstract game with a theme of hares struggling for feeding ground. On a 5x6 square grid board, players have five hare tiles each. Their goal is to capture four of their opponent's hares or to occupy their opponent's burrow for one turn. There are three types of hares, which determine their movement directions allowed, and each type has a flip side that alters its direction. You may flip your tile by consuming one turn, or moving into a special square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This intellectual game is suitable for those who began to enjoy thinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two editions of the game. The original Version was produced for the Spring 2015 Tokyo Game Market (TGM). Each TGM, designers are invited to face a challenge, to design a game under certain conditions. This is where the &amp;yen;500 microgames came from, which included Love Letter. The Spring 2015 TGM challenge was '2種カードゲー企画' which was to bring games using only two types of cards. The first edition of Eat Or Eaten was produced to satisfy the 2種カードゲー企画 challenge. The components were only cards and the field was only 3 x 4 square. The Hares behaved differently between editions too. In the first edition, when a Hare was flipped over, it changed the power relationship with opponents' Hares, leading to a fourway stand-off. In the second edition, produced for the Autumn 2015 TGM, the Hares have equal power, but flipping a Hare changes the way it moves. In both Versions, the Hares are competing for food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's summary&lt;br/&gt;うさぎの餌場争いをテーマにした、二人用のアブストラクトゲームです。５匹のうさぎを使って争い、相手の巣穴マスに１ターン留まるか、相手のうさぎを１匹にすると勝利します。駒は裏返すことによって、動き方が変化します。頭をしっかりと使うゲームで、考えることが楽しくなってきた方におすすめです。&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
