			<description>A car race game that includes elements of Memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is given a set of 20 cards. Your set is shuffled and layed face down in two rows of 10 cards. This will be your 'track'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn, a player turns over two cards. If they match, his car can move on to one of them if one of the two cards is 'next in line' on the track. Thus, the first thing to do is to get a matched card on one of the two start cards. Having acheived that, you want to get a card face up in row 2, and so on. If you do not find a match,your turn is over. If you do find one, you can turn over two more cards and keep going until you fail to expose a matching pair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach row 10 on his track, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
