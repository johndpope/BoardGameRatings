							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Eagles</name>
									
			<description>The Game of Eagles is a Checkers variant that is played on a checkerboard with eight pieces to a side.  The pieces are tall Eagles with wings held up, and are the only thing this game has to do with Eagles.  The game could easily be played with an ordinary Checkers set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is rotated so that light-colored corners are closest to each player.  The closest square is empty, but the next closest eight squares are where the Eagles start the game for each player.  Players take turns moving and capturing each other's Eagles.  Eagles may move to one adjacent light-colored square in any direction.  They may jump a friendly piece, like in Halma, to an opposite vacant square.  Multiple jumps are possible but not required.  When jumping an opponent's Eagle in the same manner, the opponent's piece is removed from the game.  Jumping and capturing are not compulsory.  The first player to remove all his opponent's pieces from the board (or to trap them so they cannot move) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
