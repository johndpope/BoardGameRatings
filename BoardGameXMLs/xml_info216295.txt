			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gabberson&amp;rsquo;s Keep holds a tale of a seasoned warrior, and wizard driven mad by the death of his one true love. Jacob Gabberson came from a long line of metal smiths. Jacob was quite an artisan himself. In his younger years he was not satisfied with the life of a smithy and tried his hand at adventuring. By mid age Jacob had acquired enough wealth to build a keep for him self. He hired the best Dwarven craftsmen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 1st level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
