			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space station in peril? Check. Warrior aliens with a blood feud? Check. Hand-wavy quantum physics, Star cult zealots, and stupid people desperate to escape? Check, check and check! Welcome to Star Station Sigma, at the edge of the White Hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heroes aboard Star Station Sigma took one look at that dimensional anomaly and they got the hell out of town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the &amp;ldquo;white hole&amp;rdquo; (that&amp;rsquo;s what the super-genius science team called it) tore part of the station&amp;rsquo;s hull clean off, the stupid bastards in charge ordered an evacuation. A few minutes after that, they were headed back to Space Legion territory with FTL drives at maximum. But the white hole had busted the lower deck all to hell, damaging many of the escape pods, so a bunch of people got stranded aboard Star Station Sigma. The losers, mostly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those left behind: some junior officers with delusions of competence some hard-drinking pilots who didn&amp;rsquo;t respond to the alarm quickly enough, maintenance staff (glorified janitors), a few asshole security officers, and a bunch of prisoners from the holding area. Now everyone&amp;rsquo;s trying to figure out how the hell we&amp;rsquo;re going to get off this ship. Problem is, the Ax&amp;rsquo;Tularians hate the Kruk&amp;rsquo;Chels, the prisoners hate security, and the crew members hate the officers. The station&amp;rsquo;s orbiting a white hole, and everyone&amp;rsquo;s trying to kill everybody else, and we&amp;rsquo;re just a clump of space-waste circling the drain. I should&amp;rsquo;ve stuck with smuggling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This playset by Rafael Chandler includes a Stunt Die mechanic for atomizing the station as you play, for added trouble!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
