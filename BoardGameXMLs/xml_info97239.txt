			<description>Each player tries to complete a row of five numbered cards with one kind of precious stone. &lt;br/&gt;There are four kinds of stones. Each player secretly has a kind of stone that s/he collects, and a row of five face-down cards in front of him/her. In a turn, a player takes a card from another player and looks at it. If it is the kind of stone s/je is looking for, s/he places the card face-down in front of him/her (in the right position, 1-5). If it is a different kind of stone, the card can go to any of the other positions. In any case the card that was in that position before goes to the position of the card that was drawn. &lt;br/&gt;A player who reveals what kind of stone s/he is looking for gets two bonus moves. &lt;br/&gt;The first player to complete the row of five cards of his/her preferred kind in the right order is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in WIN - Das Spielejournal 418 in January 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
