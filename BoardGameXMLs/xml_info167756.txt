			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traver Jigssaw (yes, spelled that way) is a simple puzzle game that allows the user to load any image (well, in at least .jpg and .gif formats - it doesn't take .png).  The user can then choose to break the image into a set number of pieces ranging from 4 (2x2) to 144 (12x12) - the more pieces, the harder the puzzle, of course.  The pieces appear as rectangles, not traditional jigsaw shapes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two modes of moving pieces around, drag and swap.  You can set the scale of the image to either normal or &amp;quot;fit screen&amp;quot;, which is most useful for very large images.  You can toggle the status of the puzzle, showing how many pieces are still not in the correct position.  You can also simply unscramble the image with a single click, then rescramble it to a new random distribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is very &amp;quot;light&amp;quot;, consisting only of an .exe file and a .cfg file.  Together they only take up 105 kb of disk space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
