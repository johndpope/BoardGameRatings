			<description>From the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[P]unching out a Senator just gets you throw in in jail. Revealing his secret affair with an underage prostitute? That's a revenge that will last forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game are defined by Abilities (Attributes), Resources, Values, and Threads (Traits).  Abilities range from 2 to 10 and, sometimes, higher.  Each Ability is aligned with a suit in a stripped deck of French playing cards:  Passion (Hearts), Logic (Spades), Truthiness (Clubs), and Reputation (Diamonds).  The Ability rank corresponds to a card rank, used during conflict resolution.  Character Resources are much like Skills but are more inclusive.  Values are narrative traits that define the character's inviolate principles.  Finally, Threads represent the efforts the character is engaged in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game can be played with a single deck of cards, play is greatly facilitated by the use of multiple decks with different backs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
