			<description>Every fourth year there is a student carnival in the university city of Lund, Sweden. This game was published for the carnival of 1986. Basically, it is a variant of Monopoly and Finans with a carnival theme. Players are trying to be the first to collect five floats for the carnival parade. Players roll and move on the board, picking up cards and performing various actions. Interestingly, these `students&amp;acute; can buy and sell shops on the board. There are also more believable actions, like attending lectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;Game board&lt;br/&gt;6 pawns&lt;br/&gt;2 dice&lt;br/&gt;Various cards&lt;br/&gt;Paper money&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pawns and dice are of traditional standard, while cards and rules are very simple but functional.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
