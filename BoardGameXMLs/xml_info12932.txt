			<description>Based on an original mythology that is currently being written by the game's developer David Weinstock, ChessHeads is a trading card game that is played with any normal chess set. Players build minimum 30-card decks, with no maximum size to a deck. Generally, we say that this game is appropriate for players ages 8 to 108 (8 and up).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ChessHeads, players need to know the basic moves of the chess pieces in normal chess, and play with collectible cards which greatly influence the characteristics of the board and pieces on their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When one captures a piece in ChessHeads, it goes into that players &amp;quot;Entigy Pool&amp;quot; to be used as a resource in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to Checkmate the opponent's King, or to &amp;quot;bare&amp;quot; the opponent's King of all other pieces on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
