			<description>Space Football: One on One (known in Japan as Super Linear Ball) is an American football-type game that takes place in the future with two athletes playing against each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using retro grav hovercrafts, these two athletes must gain possession of a hovering ball. There are twelve different drivers to choose from and the frame rate offers fast action on the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features included mode 7 scrolling and MIDI-quality sound. The player moves the ball up the field by shooting it. Nintendo Power once accidentally claimed that this game was a one-player only game. However, they did correct their mistake in a future issue. Obstacles are thrown in the players way to block progress. This is to replace the lack of defenders used in an American football game played in the real world. These obstacles include magnetic flux fields that drains the player's energy and spincycles that twist the player out of control. Every background has a science fiction look to it with the stars and the space colony being shown. The goal scoring areas are similar to soccer nets but without the goalkeeper blocking it. It is assumed that each player is a quarterback, wide receiver, and defensive lineman all rolled into one person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a timer announcing the number of time units left in the game. The actual gameplay resembles Faceball 2000 and Ballblazer more than the modern-day football played by the NFL. There are also elements of polo to the overall presentation as the player is not allowed to hold the ball after four seconds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Space Football: One on One&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
