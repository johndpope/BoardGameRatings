			<description>Game Documentation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legends of Murder is a fantasy/role-playing/murder mystery game, and you are its main character. As the Inspector, you have been summoned to a small castle near the harbor city of Erdwyn to investigate the murder of the King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This castle -- the site of the murder -- is a day's journey across the Northern Sea from your own kingdom. Hired by the advisor of the deceased King, an elf named Ash, you set foot in the castle after a long journey across the sea, and the game begins...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your ultimate purpose in Legends of Murder is to discover the murderer of the King. There are numerous riddles and puzzles to solve along the way, as well as many people to meet and places to explore.  It is very important that you talk to everyone you encounter, search all rooms of the castle you enter, and make note of what you learn for later reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
