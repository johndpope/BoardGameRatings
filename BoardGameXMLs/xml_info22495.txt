							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">H. R. Pufnstuf Game</name>
									
			<description>Game is based on the trippy children's television series H. R. Pufnstuf from the late sixties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must attempt to collect a single set of 4 cards which form a picture of one of the shows characters (Jimmy, Pufnstuf, Freddie, Cling/Clang) when assembled, depending on the character selected by the player at the start of the game.  Each card is duplicated once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 32 cards are dealt in 4 piles face down on the board in designated areas.  Gameplay is directed by a spinner.  Cards are taken up or returned to the board, or taken from opponents, depending on the spin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect the four correct cards that complete their character picture wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
