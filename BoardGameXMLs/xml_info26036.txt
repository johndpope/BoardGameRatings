							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Race the Moon</name>
									
			<description>The object of this game is to plant the tulip garden before the moon is full. Each turn the player rolls the dice and can plant a tulip of the color rolled. If the moon is rolled, the player must add a moon piece to the central moon puzzle. If the moon is complete before any gardens are planted then the moon wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a co-operative aspect in that if a player rolls a tulip color that they already have in their garden then they may donate the tulip to a different player. No player may have two tulips of the same color in their garden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is crafted from wooden components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
