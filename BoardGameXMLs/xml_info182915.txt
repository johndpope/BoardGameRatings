			<description>ATTACK    RAID    SURROUND&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Troy circa 1200 BCE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your destiny lies in your hands, as you stand before the ancient city of Troy, known to the ancient Greeks as Ilios.  Attack, raid, surround and defend in campaigns between the Greeks and the Trojans found in Homer&amp;rsquo;s epic tale &amp;ldquo;The Iliad.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ILIOS: Battle for Troy, 2 to 4 players take turns deploying warrior tiles with white rays representing spears and swords and their directions of attack.  When a player raids a warrior tile, they place a disk of their color to occupy it.  Warrior tiles are occupied by different players throughout the game until a tile is completely surrounded.  It is then removed from the board, and added to the plunder of the player occupying it. Multiple tiles may be surrounded on one play, and surrounded tiles may be occupied by other players. This means your opponents can plunder on your turn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Troy Expansion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The climax of the battles of Troy was the capture of the fortified city of Troy, which was only taken with the Trojan horse. Capture Troy yourself with the aid of the horses and oracles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Social Abstract Game SAG calls for a blend of offensive and defensive strategies, with suspense introduced by the random draw of tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deluxe version using beautiful wooden tiles is available now as part of the Ancient World Treasure Chest Collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ILIOS was designed to be a Social Abstract Game SAG for 2 to 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
