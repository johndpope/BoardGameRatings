			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Trident City! This is a setting which combines medieval fantasy and superheroes, now for use with the Icons Superpowered Roleplayin game system from Ad Infinitum, under the Icons Compatibility License. In the independent city-state of Trident City, heroes such as the demi-god Wardeva, the exiled  Dwarven prince Terrasmith, and the barrier-creating Rampart, match their powers against the evil villains that threaten it. Among them are the mad alchemist Castor Crucible, the master thief called the Raven King, the anarachic Desecrators, and the evil organization known as WYRM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trident City is a living, breathing city which can be used with the existing heroes given in the book, or with your own PCs. Within you will find details on the city government, the different districts of the city, law enforcement, businesses, and important peoples. There is also general information on the world of Terra and the nations surrounding Trident City, as well as about the cosmos to which the world belongs and some of the races which dwell on other planes and worlds. Over three dozen major NPCs, both heroes and villains can be found in this book, as well as more stats for minor NPCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
