							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fist of Dragonstones: The Tavern Edition</name>
									
			<description>Fist of Dragonstones: Tavern Edition is a closed-fist, bidding game. Players try to outwit their opponents by using gold and magic coins to buy control of an ever-changing cast of enchanted character cards. The powers from those characters help collect valuable Dragonstones, lend their magical powers, help foil other players, and convert Dragonstones into victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each character card, players choose the number of coins they want to bid by placing them in a closed fist. All players reveal their bets at the same time, and the winner of the auction gains control of the card's powers. Depending on the card, you may win additional coins or Dragonstones, gain powers, place spells on other players, or score points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules of Fist of Dragonstones: Tavern Edition have been updated from the original Fist of Dragonstones to improve gameplay, including the introduction of the King's Favor, which speeds up play. The game includes more than 70 special character cards in the game, compared to 25 special characters in the original game. Some of these special characters can be saved for later use in the game. Thematically and artistically, the game has been re-imagined into The Dragon &amp;amp; Flagon universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Legend:&lt;br/&gt;Many, many years ago, an enchanted forest lay hidden between two great mountain ranges. The forest valley was home to several kingdoms whose rival princes battled with each other to unite the entire realm under one flag. To gain advantage, princes vied with each other to collect powerful magic amulets called Dragonstones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like many royals, over time the princes began to prefer the comfort and safety of their fortified castles. Rather than risk their own lives by venturing out to search for these amulets, they paid handsome rewards to Adventurers who could bring them the Dragonstones. The allure of the princes' wealth soon filled the enchanted forest with all manner of wizards, witches, dwarves, goblins, and many other enchanted creatures &amp;mdash; all in pursuit of the magic Dragonstones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This enchanted land is now almost entirely lost to legend, yet at a cozy inn known as The Dragon &amp;amp; Flagon, the memory of Dragonstones is kept alive by the Adventurers that frequent the tavern. Even today, a nod from a knowing traveler may persuade the Adventurers to recount some of the ancient tales. And if they take a particular liking to you, those Adventurers may bring out their own collection of magic coins and challenge you to a simple game of skill and luck, giving you a chance to have your own Fist of Dragonstones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
