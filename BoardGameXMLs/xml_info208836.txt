							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Championship Game of Football</name>
									
			<description>This pocket-size wartime football game consists of a block of wood less than 5&amp;quot; a side that is wrapped in simulated leather. Included in a cardboard drawer in theblock are an unusual 48-space spinner, four wooden pegs and a rules sheet with results table. The board has 100 holes on the field punched diagonally between each printed 10-yard division on the field. There also are holes to mark &amp;quot;Yards to Gain&amp;quot; (1-10) and downs (1-4).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results table is laid out in columns. The first two columns handle kick-offs and returns. The remaining six are the play call options for the offensive player: Line Plunge; End Run; Trick Play; Forward Pass; Lateral Pass; and Punt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 48 rows of results, each indicating the yards gained or lost on the called play according to the result on the spinner. Field goals may be attempted within 30 yards, and succeed on spins of 1 or multiples of 5; points after touchdown score on an even number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
