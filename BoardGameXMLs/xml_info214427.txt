			<description>Hex Casters will make you do crazy things...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;... like sing when you speak, knock three times before playing a card, or sneeze when some one passes you a Hex!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use Defense cards to save yourself and pass Hexes to your friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AVOID THE HEXES TO WIN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hex Casters is a simple party game where players try to avoid getting hexes, which require them to do different things during the game. On your turn you draw a hex, and give it to a player of your choice. That player can use defense cards to try to pass it to someone else, who can also use defense cards. The player who can't defend or chooses not to takes the hex.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the round, you may draw one defense card for each hex you have. Game ends when one player gains a predetermined number of hexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
