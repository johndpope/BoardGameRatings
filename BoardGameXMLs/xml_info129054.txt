			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This World War II naval simulation game portrays the North Atlantic cruise of the German battleships Bismarck and Prinz Eugen in May 1941. The Germans are opposed by a variety of British warships, and both sides have submarines and aircraft available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tactical and strategic level gameplay modes are offered. The player can select a strategic game lasting 5, 10 or 15 days, with each game turn constituting four hours. The game can end earlier if the Bismarck is sunk or reaches Brest (although a start-up option allows the player to elect for gameplay to continue after Brest is reached.) Both sides may resupply and repair ships in ports, and the German player also has two tankers which allow for refueling at sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In-Game Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DATE: 22 April 1941&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;... signal from C-IN-C Navy to Fleet Commander Lutjens on board K.M. Bismarck ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Operation Rhine is to inflict the greatest possible damage to the enemy by destroying his merchant shipping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accordingly, the Bismarck and Prinz Eugen are to be deployed as commercial raiders in the North Atlantic. These orders set in motion one of the greatest naval confrontations of World War II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the Bismarck and Prinz Eugen are raising steam and preparing to sortie, the British Admiralty is developing a plan to destroy the pride of the German Navy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relive this famous battle and test your skills against the very best!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
