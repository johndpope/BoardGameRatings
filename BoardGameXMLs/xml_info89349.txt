			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Math Blaster Episode II follows canonically with Episode I in Davidson Associate&amp;rsquo;s Math Blaster series. The game is designed to teach children math skills, and places emphasis on basic operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and logic puzzles. It is meant to complement the math skills learned in Episode I.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blasternaut, Spot, and Galactic Commander are on a quest to find the Lost City when their ship is attacked by Doctor Minus, a subtraction-obsessed robot, and they crash-land on a deserted planet. The planet turns out to be the location of the Lost City, but Doctor Minus dispatches his minions to capture the Blasternaut crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four stages that are all new to the series:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maze Craze &amp;ndash; Players use the crew to navigate a maze and gather numbers and operators to create correct math equations. Each crew member has unique abilities that are required to travel through the stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creature Creator &amp;ndash; Players start with a creature made up of a number of parts. Each step indicates how many changes must be made, and the team must create the final creature through logical deduction (much like the Mastermind boardgame).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Position Splash &amp;ndash; Negatrons are attacking the crew, and one of them is carrying the number required to complete the equation at the bottom of the screen. Players control the crew and must eliminate the incorrect answers while simultaneously avoiding their attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number Hunt &amp;ndash; A range of numbers is provided at the top of the screen. The player must use the crew to jump to the platforms that contain equations with solutions in the target range. Some platforms will recede into the wall, and if a character falls they are out for the stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Episode II is designed for children from 8 to 13.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
