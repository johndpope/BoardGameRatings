			<description>An eejits card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have played Top Trumps, then you'll know how to play BAHOOCHIE! It's a very similar game with a Scottish theme where players battle with eejits to try and win them all! But the game comes with a wee twist.....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BAHOOCHIE! cards can change everything! How you win or lose a single round or even how you win or lose the entire game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players battle curious creatures to try and win them all.  Usually the highest score on the card wins, but shout BAHOOCHIE! and you can change how the game is played, how a round is won.  Watch out, though - BAHOOCHIE! cards can be a help or a hindrance - it's the chance you take.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All cards feature unique art &amp;amp; curious eejits. There are 29 CREATURE CARDS and 16 special BAHOOCHIE CARDS &amp;ndash; Deep Fried Battered Food Product (of some description), Bagpipes of Dooooooom!, Sporrans and other weird Scottish stuff are included in each pack!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
