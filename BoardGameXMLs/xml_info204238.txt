							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Survive The Horde Party Game</name>
									
			<description>Survive The Horde Party Game is a 2-8 player character-driven game with zombie battles and in-game challenges intended for a 17+ audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts by selecting a character card and a set number of brain chips. Players take turns in a clockwise order. To take a turn, a player takes the top card from the zombie deck and reads it out loud. Zombie cards may have an in-game challenge, a Curse, or you may have to attack the zombie with a roll of the dice. When a zombie is defeated, players are rewarded with a survivor card. These survivor cards feature wacky ways to slay zombies, help you survive, and sabotage other players. When a player fails to defeat a zombie or complete a challenge, they must turn one of their brain chips to its undead side. If all brains have been turned to their undead side, a player is now undead and must try to win battles and challenges to get themselves back in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player wins by being the last player with at least one healthy brain chip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
