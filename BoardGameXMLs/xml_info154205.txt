							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Shivil War</name>
									
			<description>Free P&amp;amp;P game! Requirements - at least 3 A4 pieces of paper, 6 D6 and 1 D10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shivilnecks have had it with being the Husk's breakfast, lunch and dinner, but they're just too tasty for the Husks to give up! So, from thereforth the Shivil War began.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will need to deploy each of their 6 units one at a time, each with a custom made weapon or spell unique to that unit. It's up to the player to make the most out of their unique abilities and slay the opposition; gaining the means to secure your home territories and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A typically round consists of 3 phases, namely:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Recruitment Phase, in which both players choose a unit to recruit and forge them the kind of weapon or spell the player thinks will be the most useful, given the success of their Recruitment Roll. Choose wisely - you can never recruit two rounds in a row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Activation Phase is where most of a action takes place. Move and attack with any units you can with the hopes of slaying an enemy unit and receive it's bounty of 1 coin. Or, if the unit is already carrying a coin it's a race straight back to it's home square, where it can lock it down and finalise their role in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Purchase Phase simply lays down the opportunity to gain the upper hand via the purchase of an upgrade. Although these may seem like a novelty, some of the more useful features of the game such as the top tear weapons and routine healing. Choose wisely!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
