			<description>In Monsterjagd, or Monster Hunt, each player receives a set of five monster-catching devices, which are laid out in a row in front of the player, the order memorized and the cards turned face down. Each turn, two monster cards are simultaneously revealed - one showing dark-colored versions of the monsters and one showing light-colored versions. Certain combinations of monster sets may only be captured using specific monster-catching devices. As quickly as possible, players check their reference cards to determine which monster-catching device will work for the monster pair currently on display and place the appropriate card in the center of the table. The fastest players are rewarded while the slowest players or those selecting the wrong monster-catching apparatus are penalized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
