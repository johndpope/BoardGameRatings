			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game for three or four players. Two will be suspects accused of some serious crime, and one or two will be police detectives. It&amp;rsquo;ll be most fun with two and two. Cut out the cards below and hand them out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game operates on the principle of agreement &amp;ndash; when someone articulates some fact about the crime, the suspects, or the overall situation, you must accept and build on that fact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after twenty minutes or when the detectives are satisfied they&amp;rsquo;ve got as much as they are going to get out of the suspects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
