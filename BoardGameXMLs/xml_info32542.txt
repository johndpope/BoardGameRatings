			<description>Released in the 1970's by Belgian publisher Nathan. The players are thieves at night and try to break into a building, remaining in the shadow and unnoticed. But the police is in the area. Make sure the alarm doesn't go off! Each play is different because of the system that triggers the alarm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won by the first robber to steal the gold from the bank, without setting off the alarm. You must then escape to any getaway point without being caught by the cops. Watch out for hazard squares and short cuts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
