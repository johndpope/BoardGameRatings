							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Royal Execution</name>
									
			<description>In Royal Execution you create your own military and political faction of commoners, nobility, and royalty to claim the Thrones of an imaginary Realm. Align yourself with one or more Royal lines of succession to control the thrones of King, Queen, and Bishop recreating the numerous dynastic civil wars of the Middle Ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Challenge: Your opponents have troops, assassins, and can stage revolts. Rival royalty and their factions may attempt to imprison you - or worse - gather the right support to condemn your royal to death by execution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just like the power struggles of the Middle Ages you'll soon be facing fierce competition for political and military power, which quickly becomes shamelessly ruthless, viciously vengeful, hilariously melodramatic, and just plain fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are fascinated by the pomp, power, and melodrama of Medieval royalty and their struggles for power - this is the game for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is score as many points as possible by claiming sovereignty over territories and controlling the royal thrones. Players maneuver to capture the Thrones of King, Queen, and Bishop of the Realm and control their lucrative territories - scoring points along the way. The first player to reach a predetermined number of points is declared the Supreme Sovereign of the Realm and game winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player is entitled to make one common play during their turn. Common plays represent the powers of the lower classes and a treacherous noble&amp;rsquo;s access to the royal court. For example, revolts were ways the populace kept royalty and their policies in check. Assassins often gained access to royalty with the help of treacherous nobility. Both of these cards (Revolt and Assassin) represent real threats to royalty who fail to protect themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Royalty may make an additional Royal play during their turn. Royal plays represent the unique powers of reigning royalty and are easy to identify by the Royal Play scroll on top of each card. They can be used to protect your royalty (for example, Troops) and to eliminate hostile ones (Royal Execution).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play Options: Teams; Role Playing; Historical Based Games; Adding the Medieval England Feudal Deck; Adding the Medieval Combat Deck, Alliances and Pledges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
