							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Options: Strategic Game of Numbers</name>
									
			<description>Options was a game that 3M apparently planned to publish in their bookcase game series, but it never appeared. At least one prototype exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 12x14 grid. Each player has an identical set of number tiles (two each of 0-9) plus two &amp;quot;proxy&amp;quot; tiles and two blocking tiles. The board is seeded with the proxy and blocking tiles and then players take turns playing a tile or replacing a proxy with a matching regular tile and placing the proxy somewhere else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a tile is played it must be next to or one space away from an &amp;quot;object&amp;quot; tile, and must either be one lower or higher than that tile, or equal to it if the play is on one of the starred spaces in the center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are scored for getting scoring tiles (those numbered 1, 3, or 7) in scoring rows; a scoring row is an orthogonal row of three or four of a player's tiles, but if there are three they must be in sequence (with wraparounds allowed). Points are also scored for creating situations in which the opposing player cannot play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
