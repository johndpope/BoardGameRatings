							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Neighborhood Watch: Savage Edition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neighborhood Watch is an adventure seed for use with Contagion Savage Edition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Contagion is a dark and terrifying place. On the surface, it looks much like the world you and I live in. Just beneath that surface, in the shadows, rages an ancient con ict between supernatural factions who all seek dominion over the Earth and control over the souls of humanity. As a byproduct of this con ict, various factions have created inhuman monstrosities and released them into the world. While most average people are fortunate enough to never encounter such terrible creatures, those who do nd themselves facing things that reason cannot explain. Often, this ends tragically for the poor souls who have stumbled upon the foot soldiers of the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neighborhood Watch centers on the aftermath of such an encounter. When a group of teenage girls try out an urban legend at a sleepover it ends in tragedy. A quiet neighborhood is rocked by the death of one of their children and the characters are left with questions that the authorities cannot answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
