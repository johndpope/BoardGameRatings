			<description>The Last Victory: Von Manstein's Backhand Blow, covers the time between the fall of Stalingrad to the spring thaw that shut down the Eastern Front. The Soviets. flush with victory, thundered west towards Kharkov in an attempt to finish off the battered remnants of the German Army Group South.  Falling victim to the law of overstretch, the Soviets were badly surprised and beaten back through the strong leadership and superior strategy on the part of the Germans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If Stalingrad had determined that the Germans could not win the war, then the Battle of Kharkov led them to think they had not yet lost. From the Battle's results, each side drew vastly different conclusions. The Germans were determined to renew the offensive, to finish the uncompleted victory cut short by the thaw. The Soviets were determined to await the offensive, trap and immobilized the attacker, and then launch a massive counteroffensive of their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With over 1000 playing pieces, four maps, two rule books and in depth briefing material including historical review, from the Winter Storm Campaign Series this operational level game is the sequel to Winter Storm by Vanguard Games (Board Games) and covers the campaign for Rostov and Kharkov in February-March 1943.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system features detailed supply rules similar to OCS, weak ZOCs that show the potential of infiltration and the effect of terrain, and a flexible sequence of play to show the principles of mobile warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: 2 days&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 5 miles / 8 kilometers&lt;br/&gt;Units: Battalion to Corps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;Four 17 x 22&amp;quot; full color maps&lt;br/&gt;Five dual-side printed countersheets (1,080 1/2&amp;quot; counters - approximately 600 combat units &amp;amp; 480 markers )&lt;br/&gt;One 32-page Winter Sturm Campaign Series Standard Rules rulebook&lt;br/&gt;One 12-page The Last Victory rulebook&lt;br/&gt;Five Player Aid Charts &amp;amp; Tables&lt;br/&gt;Two 6-sided dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Playability: High&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 4-15&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
