			<description>Mega Man Zero 2, known in Japan as Rockman Zero 2​ (ロックマンゼロ2), is a video game developed by Inti Creates and published by Capcom for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld game console. It is the second video game in the Mega Man Zero subseries of Mega Man video games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game follows almost the exact same game-play rules as its predecessor, Mega Man Zero. Once again, players take control of the Reploid known as Zero, and lead him through various levels in the battle against the forces of Neo Arcadia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The controls are identical to that in the previous game, with players given the option to assign functions to the buttons they are most comfortable using. Once again, players are given a variety of weapons that include the Z-Saber, the Buster Shot, and the Shield Boomerang. Zero's skill levels with these weapons are minimal at first, but they will strengthen with repeated use on enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Triple Rod from the previous game, however, has been replaced with the Chain Rod. It can be used to pull enemies or objects closer, pull shields off enemies or if latched on to an immovable object, to swing over chasms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyber Elves also make a reappearance and once again, they come in three types, Nurse, Animal and Hacker. Unlike the previous game, where all of the Sub-Tanks could only be obtained from using four special Nurse Cyber Elves, two Sub-Tanks are hidden in the game in two of the eight selectable stages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of selecting from a list of missions, the traditional Stage Select option found in the Mega Man and Mega Man X games makes a return, although you can only select from four at a time. Unlike in Mega Man Zero, none of the stages are linked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Mega Man Zero 2 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
