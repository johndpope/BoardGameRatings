			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the modern world, terrorism has escalated and now our most precious resource is the bomb disposal technician. Terrorists have begun targeting the techs themselves until a shortage occurred. Mechanical assist devices are good, but they can't get everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What the world needed was someone willing to be the eyes and ears of a bomb tech. Someone who could go where mechanical devices couldn't go and then get the job done. Of course, very few people would volunteer for a job like that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter the US Government with a solution. They had been working on breeding more intelligent capuchin monkeys which they now set to training as they eyes and ears of bomb disposal technicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Monkey Bomb Squad (technically known as Capuchin Anti‚ÄêTerrrorist Coordinating Handlers or CATCH) has been in limited operation for two years. It is top secret both to keep terrorists from adjusting their tactics and to prevent public outcry over the use of monkeys in this manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
