			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It's a simple game, just race across and back again.&lt;br/&gt;Shake the dice and move your snake, but then some care you'll have to take.&lt;br/&gt;Round the tree you'll have to go, see what colour you can throw.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a snake which consists of six plastic hexagons and a head piece. Players are also given a tree, the hexagonal base of which matches the color of the head of their particular snake. The trees serve as markers, defining start &amp;amp; finish points and course layout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plastic hexagons which form the 'body' of each snake come in six colors; these correspond to the colored dots on the sides of the die used for gameplay. Snakes move forward depending on the color thrown on the die; the color thrown becomes the TAIL of the snake and all hexagons situated behind this are moved to the front of the snake. The hexagonal segments must remain in the same sequence throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to complete whatever course was determined prior to the game starting is the winner (generally snakes start adjacent to their tree and return).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
