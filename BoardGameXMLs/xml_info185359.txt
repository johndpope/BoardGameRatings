			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;F.R.E.S.C.O. provides an exceptionally minimalist rule system for gaming.  Characters have seven Attributes:  Force (used in combat), Agility, Constitution (also known as &amp;quot;Hit Points&amp;quot;), Intelligence, Sensibility, Reactivity, and Fascination.  The first six are randomly generated with 3d6.  Fascination is calculated by a formula.  The rules suggest non-human characters should have racial modifiers but provides the modifiers only for an Elf, as an example.  Characters then choose &amp;quot;a couple of special talents&amp;quot; which are things they can do.  Examples provided are:  Ambidextrous, &amp;quot;I can make cowboy hats&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I can drive a star ship&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I am a bridge player&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;I can stand alcohol&amp;quot;.  Characters then receive &amp;quot;a fair amount&amp;quot; of money and purchase equipment.  The game does not provide a monetary system or an equipment list, so this will be up to the GM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a single resolution mechanic, called a Simulation.  The GM determines when a situation should require a check, and then determines which base Attribute is involved.  The GM also establishes a Difficulty (negative for easier actions, positive for difficult actions) for the action.  The player then calculates their TAF (Throw for Action, but also referred to as a FAR: Fresh Action Roll) which is their Attribute value minus 2d6 minus the Difficulty.  If the result is positive the action succeeds, though rolling double-six always results in failure and a double-one always results in success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat uses the same basic mechanism with the added (minor) complexity of the defender's Force also being subtracted form the roll.  This results in weak (low Force) characters being essentially unable to hit except on special rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters gain Experience Points and then spend them to increase Attributes or gain &amp;quot;special talents&amp;quot;.  Note that the mechanism for implementing &amp;quot;special talents&amp;quot; is never addressed.  Characters sheets are provided in the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
