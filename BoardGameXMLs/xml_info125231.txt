							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City Chapel</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This small chapel was originally conceived as a fortified holy house at the centre of a, at that time, small settlement. Built to weather natural disasters as well as attacks by beast and men this can still be seen in its design. Although the settlement around this holy house has grown into a sizable town, the chapel itself has remained largely untouched. Very few large glass windows replace the original arrow slits nowadays and a wide double staircase leading up to the chapels elevated plateau, covered in fine sand showing every recent footstep, has been added more as an afterthought than anything else. Even the double door, the chapels only entrance, is still a heavy steel reinforced affair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
