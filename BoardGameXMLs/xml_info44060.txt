			<description>The gang of orcs surrounded me in seconds. One of them swung a spiked mace at my head and I blew his brains out without thinking. Another narrowly missed with a rusty sword. Behind me, I heard the death rattle of another orc, and her beautiful voice.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Don't just stand there; kill something.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;So I did.&lt;br/&gt;We fought together from that day forward. We married after the war, our crest a crossed gun and sword. Knights together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic seethes beneath everyday affairs. Turn a ways, and wander into a Pocket Kingdom where witches and alchemists sell their wares right under the noses of a mundane population. But one person in 20 is Aware, part of the secret lands of magic. Of those, a special few are Legends: epic heroes who fight evil with strength, cunning and raw idealism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elf, dwarf, gnome and human Legends use the mystic Spheres to defend their beliefs. Their quests turn them into avatars of magic or send their swords against Da'ath, Lord of the Abyss. Idealism is more than just a buzzword - it's the source of magic. The old traditions of classic fantasy, from the Dark Lord to a hero's quests, burn with new life, bound to the Legend's spiritual journey. Every Legend has a path to enlightenment and glory. His beliefs (in the form of actual game traits) give him power, whether he honors or betrays them. He moves through secret, strange lands in a modern supernatural setting whose protagonists don't skulk in alleys, but rule entire cities and Ministries of mystic power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;AElig;ternal Legends is a 158 page, complete modern-era RPG. Two or more players need nothing more than a handful of six-sided dice, pencils and paper to play. Combat's quick, but doesn't sacrifice tactical choices for ease of use. Freeform magic and simple spells combine into one flexible, quickly resolved sorcery system. Your character's supernatural Clade combines with her archetypal Spheres to grant distinct superhuman abilities. The game's Ready 2 Run system emphasizes fast character creation, detailed action and enough discretionary &amp;quot;wiggle room&amp;quot; to suit a wide range of campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created, written and designed (and importantly, owned) by Stewart Wilson. Core system design and development by Malcolm Sheppard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
