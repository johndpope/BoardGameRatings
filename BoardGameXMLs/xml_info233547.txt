			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Guide to Creating Zero Level Players for OSRIC &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;plus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Lair of the Toad&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An introductory fantasy adventure compatible with OSRIC and 1E compatible retro-clones&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hello and welcome, adventurers and Game Masters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our eighth supplement and adventure module is &amp;quot;SR1 ZERO LEVEL PLAYER RULES&amp;quot;, which contains a brand new system for creating ZERO LEVEL PLAYER CHARACTERS for use in your Old School campaign! It also includes an exciting adventure for these new PCs, to get you right into the action! Created for a party of 4-6 characters of 0 level, &amp;ldquo;The Lair of the Toad&amp;rdquo; is sure to provide you and your players with a fun way to immediately implement these new character creation rules in your campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ZERO LEVEL PLAYER RULES: A Guide to Creating Zero Level Players for OSRIC and other OSR retro-clone games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I created these Zero Level Player Rules as a helpful way of introducing new players to role playing games and as a useful way to form a new adventuring party, forged from a close knit group, e.g. all from one community and not just random strangers. I provide a detailed, step by step character creation technique, with new features such as player origins, created with the intention of helping players invest in their avatar and of tying the characters together. I also include an adventure to help the newly created PCs bond as a group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;ldquo;The Lair of the Toad&amp;rdquo;, the players are a group of friends who have grown up together and on the fateful night in question they meet a traveler, in the person of would-be eleven sage Alura Morrowgan, who seeks their assistance in recovering her heirloom signet ring, which was lost in the market square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players realize it&amp;rsquo;s time to put down the blacksmith&amp;rsquo;s hammer, step out from behind the bar, and stop alphabetizing those scrolls for their master. It&amp;rsquo;s time for the players to strike out on their own path, to start writing their own story with their friends by their side, to earn a name for themselves and their adventuring company, it&amp;rsquo;s time for&amp;hellip;adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 20 page rules supplement and adventure module contains all the information you need to create and play fledgling zero level player characters. You will find within information on creating player characters that will assist new players in learning to role play and how to connect to their character, and to help veteran players become more connected to their characters, and to help you and your players create a more immersive experience by creating player characters that have a past together for a more cohesive group! It is our hope this product will add an entirely new aspect to your dungeon delving adventures!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement also includes a carefully crafted set of Six Pre-Generated Zero Level Player Characters, ready for immediate use in the game by players or the GM. Each of the six players is presented fully ready to play with all of the necessary stats and gear, as well as included &amp;ldquo;to hit&amp;rdquo; and saving throw tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We also include a Professional Adventurer Charter which the GM can complete and hand out to their players. To commemorate their advancement from zero level to first level in their chosen character class; a special way to mark their ascendancy to their new role as a hero in your campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To help the GM and players get right into the action, the supplement includes an all new original introductory module, full of fun and adventure but tuned to the skills and capabilities of neophyte adventurers. The adventure is fully detailed and ready for immediate use with very little preparation by the GM or the players! It is easily playable in one session of no more than 2-3 hours, so it&amp;rsquo;s great for a night of gaming enjoyment!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The module portion includes a map of the underground complex players will explore, with detailed encounters for each area and room for expansion possibilities, done in the classic Old School blue &amp;amp; white style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will also find appendices to help preparation time for a busy GM, including NEW MONSTER and NEW MAGIC ITEM information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The module also includes amazing Old School art throughout by well-known community artists, with additional artwork and maps by the author, Louis &amp;quot;sirlou&amp;quot; Kahn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module provides further background information and additional areas for adventure for those GM&amp;rsquo;s setting their campaigns in the author&amp;rsquo;s ever expanding campaign world, which now comprises FOUR different kingdoms: Jarlburgh, Alderburgh, The Red Eagle Barony, and D&amp;ugrave;n Bhriste. This adventure takes place in the western portion of the lands of D&amp;ugrave;n Bhriste, on the borderland with the danger filled lands to the south. It is very near to Fort Valour, the site of the city adventure chronicled in my previously published module SO2 Clash at Fort Valour. The area and its other exploration options are shown in a detailed Old School style map included in the supplement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book features 20 pages of excitement and adventure to help in introducing new players to your table or reinvigorate your current seasoned group of players. It is sure to please discerning GMs and players everywhere!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
