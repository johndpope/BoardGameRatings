							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">HOF Fire Team</name>
									
			<description>HOF Fire Team is an original dynamic tactical game with a setting from ultra modern to the far future. Fire Team pits squads of soldiers, guerrillas, police, and thieves or just about anyone else with a grudge against one another. Use miniatures from your existing collection, on single bases, or add any new ones of your choice. Players command a number of Teams. These being Fire Teams, Support Teams, Command Teams and trusting to sound small unit tactics and the luck of the dice they attempt to carry out their mission objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOF Fire Team is played on purpose designed 'Battle Boards' de-marked into a 20mm squared grid. These set squares allow for easy and instant measurement of game distances for movement and weapons fire along with the relation between every miniature in play and possible cover. Play is easy and lethal. Using a unique D6 mechanic based on the Firefight 2.0 engine combined with an innovative 'tech level' for all troops and the 'waypoint' mission driver this game promises fast and intense action in a compact playing area. Play in a place of your choosing even if it is too small for other 'open terrain' wargames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
