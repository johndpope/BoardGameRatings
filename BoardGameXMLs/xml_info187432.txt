							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Returner Final Fantasy Role Playing Game Lite Version</name>
									
			<description>Based upon the Returner FFRPG V2.0&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the foreword:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's been discussed many times, particularly from newer people, about having a version of the Returner FFRPG that is possible to print out without hacking down the Amazon Rain Forest.  After printing out three versions of the FFRPG (an earlier version, 1.2, and now 2.0), a Lite Version just might be necessary.  Keep in mind that this is, by no means, a substitute for the complete HTML and Word versions of the FFRPG.  Don't get me wrong: I'm not going to try and compress 200 or so pages into about 30.  This is basically a quick reference guide for those who don't want to search through 200 pages of the complete version just to, say, find out the MDC progression of a Ranger.  This can also be dubbed The FFRPG for Dummies, because it explains the system in a nutshell so newer FFRPG gamers and newer gamers in general can jump right in.  In other words, this is the meat and potatoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
