							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dead of Winter (at Bearhamer Hall)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Grand Caldera Mountains are a dangerous place at any time of the year, but especially during the Dead of Winter at Bearhammer Hall.&lt;br/&gt;Rumor has it that the ancient gods, called 'Titans', sleep in these lands. Their offspring, the true giants, prowl these high places guarding the treasure left behind by their creators. An undead ettin (Wokrah), commands undead goblins who are terrorizing the forest plateau. Wokrah's master, a mysterious, evil wizard is trying to acquire an undead army.&lt;br/&gt;This is a medium length adventure that is the third in a series that introduces adventurers to the world of Hanan Pacha. The first two, Spire of the Raven God and Lair of the Demon Princess both describe the evil that's menacing the demi-plane world. This one continues that theme and reveals a second location that connects to the dreaded, Labyrinth of the Lost (the 4th adventure). All four link together in events noted through the storyline. This one can be completed in one or two playing sessions. &lt;br/&gt;The adventure is also easy to place in most fantasy settings. It is most suited to levels 7 - 12 characters that are strong on abilities, weaponry and magic. Death comes easily and critical mistakes can cost characters their lives!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
