			<description>Trundle is an adventure-puzzler that gives player ambient gameplay experiences while they travel different areas of each world solving physical puzzles in order to advance. Each area is beautifully hand-drawn Chinese shadow art style landscapes, accompanied by a darkly ambient soundtrack for each world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are represented by a simple cog gear that is controlled by the accelerometer and can jump by tapping the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will meet a multitude of creatures inhabiting the lands you explore, most will try to help you in your quest; especially if you give them what they want..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trundle presents the player with multiple puzzles that often are required for the player to proceed, puzzles are arranged with physical shapes and constraints and sometimes have a few different ways to solve them. You will have to use wits, brains, and the occasional wheeled or legged vehicle&amp;hellip; and remember you are yourself a gear an advantage that will prove useful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
