			<description>This game is played with a standard deck of cards. Each player is dealt 13 cards, and they simultaneously choose one of them to bid. These decide the contract, if there is a trump and the partnerships also.&lt;br/&gt;Then tricks are played. You must follow suit if you can, and the trick is won by the highest trump (if any) or the highest card in the suit led. The winner of the trick leads the next.&lt;br/&gt;Scores are kept individually and cumulatively, and can fall below zero. Players score depends on the number of tricks won, but basically is positive for winning the contract, negative for losing it, and 0 if they were not involved. (Depending on the bids, 1-4 players can be involved, maybe with different goals.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
