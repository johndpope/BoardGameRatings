							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Deadly Tower of Derisive Doom</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The good wizard Justrix was once the most important person in town, using his magic to help the fields grow, to protect the town from monsters and teach the townsfolk all sorts of alchemical and magical knowldge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But something is amiss - Justirx has vanished into his tower on the edge of town, and hasn't been seen in weeks. Guardsmen from the town have investigated, but they too have gone missing. The crops are failing, and those sensitive to it sense an immense evil emanating from the tower. Your party has been hired to find out what has happened to poor Justirx, and save him - if you can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Deadly Tower of Derisive Doom is a full adventure for Dungeon World that gently pokes fun at some of the more classic RPGs. Delve into the tower and uncover a wizard who's mind is corrupted by hit die, encounter tables and Armor Classes!.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed mainly as a one-shot or campaign starter, this adventure comes complete with fronts, new enemies, multiple endings, a challenging series of encounters and scenes, interesting plot hooks, portents, handouts, maps and anything else you might need to start your next campaign, or spice up the current one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
