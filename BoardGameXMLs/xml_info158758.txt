			<description>KiCKeT!-ARENA brings tabletop fantasy gaming to the floor with huge 10&amp;Prime; (25cm) miniatures that you push around your battle arena with your foot. It is a turn-based action, dexterity and tactical game. It is similar to the game Blood Bowl, but mixes in elements from curling and real soccer. With the special abilities and constantly expanding races, weapons and spells, you can fight over the control of the ball and then actually shoot at a miniature goal to score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actually, our greatest unique feature is that we take all of the action to the FLOOR! Rather than small miniatures on a table in a virtual environment, we have huge miniatures you actually kick and slide around in any environment; whether that is your living room, your yard, at the beach, on the street. You can play almost anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our game puts you in control, using your own tactics, dexterity, and shooting action, rather than letting the dice decide the outcome. Another great feature of KiCKeT!-ARENA is that you can play with our basic rules for a simpler and faster game, or with our advanced rules that turn the game into a strategic battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build your team with different talents, weapons and magic to play KiCKeT! in your very own arena set up in your living room, garden, backyard or even at the beach!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KiCKeT! Arena mixes up fantasy games and soccer to create a kicking, passing, and fighting action game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our curved solid wooden bases make the figures slide over many different surfaces including grass, carpet, and sand. With the addition of a base sock or an asphalt glider, you can even play on tile, laminate, hardwood, stone, or asphalt. Play almost anywhere!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the future, we plan to offer even more figures, weapons, spells, abilities and obstacles to expand gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
