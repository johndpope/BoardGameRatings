			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Honour Students is the Quick Start version of the full Honour RPG.  In HS you play a 17-year-old college student who has just realised the world is a lot darker than you might first think.  Soon you'll be fighting Yaoguai demons, helping the wise Baize and casting powerful sorceries, as well as studying, drinking coffee and going to lectures!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HS allows you to get acquainted with the basic Honour system, and to get to know Hong Kong and the infamous Kowloon Walled City.  Characters created in HS will be able to be imported into the full 2nd Edition as 17-year-olds just embarking on their adult lives!  Your characters will have a backstory developed in actual gameplay!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
