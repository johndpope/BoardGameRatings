			<description>In September, 1939, Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany invaded Poland, beginning a war that would eventually involve the entire world. The Second World War cost more than 70 million lives. Among the dead were millions of innocent civilians including the victims of the Holocaust. The war ended when the United States dropped the first atomic bombs ever used in war. WWII-opoly commemorates twenty-two of the most recognizable battles and conflicts fought during WWII. The battles are positioned chronologically on the board. While playing WWII-opoly, players will learn the location and essential information about each battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of this game is to increase the size of your army and conquer the battlefields. Each game consists of a board, 2 dice, tokens, 35 infantrymen, and 15 artillery. There are Axis and Allies cards, battlefield cards for each battlefield, and enlistment rosters with different amounts of men to increase army size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
