			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When treason walks the land...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The kingdom of Dunador is in trouble. Since the king, Halfred of Dunthrane, was killed in a hunting accident, the land has hovered on the brink of civil war. Crown Prince Edmund, at 18 only half-trained and quite unprepared to assume the throne, has yet to be crowned. Currently he is on a pilgrimage to the holy shrine of Nevron in the province of Andevar. While the uncrowned king is far from home, anarchy reigns in Dunador.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the realm, plots are brewing and evil hands are eagerly clutching the sword of treason. Inevitably the focus of these intrigues is in the troubled province of Andevar to the north. For it is here that the young Prince has journeyed and here that he must be crowned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this dark hour Dunador has but one faithful servant: Hollend, chief advisor to the old king. Painfully aware of all that is at stake, Hollend has sought the aid of a brave party of adventurers in a desperate bid to tip the scales in favor of truth and justice. But, even as the party secretly enters Andevar, the forces of evil strike with blinding speed and ruthless determination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User info&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also updated 2nd edition version of the same name: Destiny of Kings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
