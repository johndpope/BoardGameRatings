			<description>&amp;quot;B4U: Hipster Battle Game&amp;quot; is a simple 3-5 player card game where you try to play a card that has the highest &amp;quot;Irony&amp;quot; value out of your hand, or &amp;quot;Six Pack&amp;quot; as I like to refer to it. It's not as easy as all that though, because someone could play an event card that will completely throw the rules of that round a curve, making it anyone's game!  This is a quick, and easy to learn and had a little snark to it as well. All you need to know how to do to play B4U is some simple math, and that's it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is easy. As a round begins, you place two card facedown on the table. One in front of you, and one to your right. The card in front of you (which can either be a Irony card, or an Event card) will always come into play each round, but the one on the right (always an Irony card) may or may not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all necessary cards are placed into play, the card in front of everyone is turned over and exposed. In the simplest version of a round, the card played with the highest Irony value wins that round. If someone has played an Event card in the front position, then the round gets skewed in some fashion (explained on the card). Such things that could happen are the player with the lowest value wins, or you use the Irony value of both cards, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When an event card is played, that is when the card to your right will be turned over. Some event cards also require you to play a third card onto the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a winner for the round is determined, the round is over, and everyone puts any non-displayed cards back into their Six Pack, and draw back up to 6 cards if the Six Pack is not complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First player to win 7 rounds is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
