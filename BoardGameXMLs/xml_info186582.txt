			<description>Smarten-Up is a game based on health and nutrition.  The game consists of 6 packs of question and answer cards with 48 cards in each deck, 1 die, 2 score pads, 1 pen, and one rule/reference sheet. Each deck has a different colour back and a different point value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players roll the die to determine which deck to draw from. The starting player asks the question on the card to the player on the left. If the player answers the question correctly, they earn the full point value of the card. If the player fails to answer correctly, the asking player may score half of the point value themselves, or ask the question of the player on the first player's left. If that player answers the question correctly, they score full points. If the player fails to answer correctly, the asking player scores full points (except for true and false questions).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some cards are bonus cards. The asking player reads the cards and gives the points to the player on the left. These two players then exchange places. This eliminates any possible preferred table positions. The game ends at a predetermined time or when a predetermined point value is reached. The player with the highest score is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
