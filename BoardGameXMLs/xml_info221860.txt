It's up to Dandara to restore balance and give direction to a directionless world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;Innovative control scheme lets action and exploration happen fluently on both touchscreen and gamepad alike!&lt;br/&gt;Beautiful, handcrafted pixel art and original soundtrack!&lt;br/&gt;Wide variety of enemies and puzzles, no room should feel the same!&lt;br/&gt;Plenty of secrets to discover!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
