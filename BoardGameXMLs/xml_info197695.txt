							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Addendum: Shape Shifting</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Change yourself and you change the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn what forms to be wary of lest you end up an unthinking rock, locked into that form forever. Discover which shape&amp;rsquo;s gifts are intrinsic to a Gossamer world, and which can work on the Grand Stair and beyond another Door! Retain your own sense of self, or risk becoming the very mask you wear via the power of Shape Shifting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shape Shifting is a new Lesser Power which confers the gifts of adaptability, change, and of course switching from one form to another. Many worlds feature Shape Shifters be they gods, monsters, or whole races unto themselves. Will you be one of them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four tiers of this power are described here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Lesser Shape Shifting: Take on a single alternate form and with practice a hybrid of that form.&lt;br/&gt;    Shape Shifting: Assume a variety of bodily types and transformational abilities, hindered by some unique drawbacks.&lt;br/&gt;    Advanced Shape Shifting: Gain amazing malleable abilities, a veritable protean form able to assume an incredible variety of shapes, specific beings, and even more unique aspects, shrugging off most of the normal drawbacks of Shape Shifting.&lt;br/&gt;    Exalted Shape Shifting: A level of the power that is extraordinarily rare, and may be reserved for beings akin to gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Addendum: Shape Shifting can be used in any game based on Erick Wujcik's Diceless Role-Playing, existing alongside powers such as Sorcery and making great use of the Endurance Attribute. Allowing you to seamlessly enhance your new or existing game with a wondrous ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
