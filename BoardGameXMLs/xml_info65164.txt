			<description>From the cover -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Looking to spice up your treasure? Do you want to add a kick to the game without having to provide your players with tons of magic items (although that's not a bad thing)? Mineral Alchemy is a short book for use with the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, 3.5 Edition rules. Within you will find 22 new alchemical items that can be made from 15 commonly found gems and minerals. The article contains descriptions of all 22 new items along with the necessary rules for creating and selling them to your players. Also included are 2 new skills that will allow the players to craft their own items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
