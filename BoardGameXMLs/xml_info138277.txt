							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Imperialism: Victorian Era Wargame Rules</name>
									
			<description>Microbadge: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set of rules was in constant use for the better part of two decades by the Western Washington Wargamers (W3). Imperialism is an eminently playable and reasonably realistic set of miniatures rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a simultaneous movement wargame, utilizing paper maps (or overlays and grease pencils) to plot movement.  The game also uses casualty record sheets to record &amp;quot;damage&amp;quot; prior to a stand being eliminated. Six sided dice are used for combat randomization and modified according to a unit's type and morale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules were originally written for use with 20mm/25mm figures, however the game is easily scaled to 15mm (and even 6mm or 2mm).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Appendices include army lists and values (so that custom armies can be created), suggested reading and viewing lists, and sources of miniature figures (several of which are still valid 30 years later).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
