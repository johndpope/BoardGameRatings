							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Vordis Scourge, Volume I</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Terrifying Merger of Cold Steel and Undead Flesh!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vordis are a group of construct-like creatures that are part machine and part undead, preserved flesh. The vordis come in many shapes and sizes, and indeed, they are in many ways more of a culture or an organization than they are a race. Their numbers grow by harvesting the flesh of living creatures, which they incorporate into ever more strange and exotic designs The ultimate goal of the vordis is nothing less than to recreate all life in their own twisted, metallic image.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents both mythic and non-mythic versions of two members of this terrifying race. The vordis eliminator (CRs 17 and 21) is an elite assassin equipped with integrated plasma beams and antimagic rays, as well as a devastating  retribution field, which reflects all damage dealt to it back against its enemies. The vordis liquefier (CRs 5 and 6) is a scuttling, spider-like monstrosity which uses an acid sprayer to reduce its victims into a puddle of easily-collected liquid flesh, allowing it to be reprocessed for the nefarious purposes of the vordis. Beyond these four monster stat-blocks, the book also contains a graft from each of these two types of vordis monstrosities, allowing players who harvest these parts to attach them to themselves in order to use the vordis&amp;rsquo;s greatest weapons against them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
