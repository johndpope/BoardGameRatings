			<description>The Macintosh Classic II (also known as the Performa 200) is a personal computer designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer, Inc. from October, 1991 to September, 1993. Like the Macintosh SE/30 it replaces, the Classic II was powered by a 16 MHz Motorola 68030 CPU and 40 or 80 MB hard disk, but in contrast to its predecessor, it was limited by a 16-bit data bus (the SE/30 had a 32-bit data bus) and a 10 MB memory ceiling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the Classic II shares a case with the earlier Classic, architecturally it is more similar to the Macintosh LC. The use of custom ICs, identical to those used in the LC, enabled the Classic II to have a lower component count than older Macs. Unlike the LC and the SE/30 before it, the Classic II oes not have an internal PDS expansion slot, making it the first slotless desktop Macintosh since the Macintosh Plus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A re-branded Classic II, called the Macintosh Performa 200, was introduced in September 1992. It has the same specifications as the original Classic II, with the addition of a speaker grille on the left side for enhanced sound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Classic II is the last black-and-white compact Macintosh, and the last desktop Macintosh to include an external floppy disk drive port. Apple discontinued support for the Classic II on January 1, 2001.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifications&lt;br/&gt;    CPU: 16 MHz (15.6672 MHz) Motorola 68030 (32-bit internally, 16-bit bus)&lt;br/&gt;    FPU: Motorola 68882 (optional)&lt;br/&gt;    ROM: 512 KB&lt;br/&gt;    RAM: 2 MB, expandable to 10 MB using two 100 ns 30-pin SIMMs&lt;br/&gt;    Display: 9&amp;quot; b&amp;amp;w screen, 512 x 342 pixels&lt;br/&gt;    Audio: 8-bit mono 22kHz&lt;br/&gt;    Hard drive: 40 or 80 MB&lt;br/&gt;    Floppy: 1.4 MB double sided&lt;br/&gt;    Size (HxWxD): 33.5&amp;quot; x 24.6&amp;quot; x 28.4&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;    Weight: 16 lb.&lt;br/&gt;    Gestalt ID: 23&lt;br/&gt;    Addressing: 24-bit or 32-bit&lt;br/&gt;    Battery: 3.6 V lithium&lt;br/&gt;    Expansion slots: none&amp;dagger;&lt;br/&gt;    Upgrade path: none&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Classic_II Macintosh Classic II]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
