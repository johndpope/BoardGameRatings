							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Gamers Constellation</name>
									
			<description>At the beginning of the game only the &amp;quot;Moon&amp;quot; tile is on the &amp;quot;night sky&amp;quot; board, and players will progressively add &amp;quot;Stars&amp;quot; tiles to the  board. There are 3 different kind of Stars (4, 5 or 6 branches).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has his own secret goal telling the shape of the Constellation he must realize on the board. To be valid, a Constellation must be made of only 1 type of Stars, and must include the Moon tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player who has his own Constellation appears on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gamers Constellation uses the same game mechanics as Xochintlan and 6x5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is available for free download on the author's website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note from the author: After having inserted this game in the BGG database, I realized there's another game named Constellation, from Hans van Halteren and published in 2003. The two games look very similar in many aspects... This is only pure coincidence !&lt;br/&gt;Mine is derived from the original &amp;quot;Fountain of the King&amp;quot; that I originally designed in 1995, which transformed into Xochintlan, then 6x5, and now the Gamers Constellation. I thought this was a great and original idea ... well, my bad !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
