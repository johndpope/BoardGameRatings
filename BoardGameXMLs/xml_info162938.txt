			<description>ESSEN: CW &amp;amp; WC is one of the ESSEN bonus tiles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing with the bonus tiles, players have one additional action during the Action phase. By placing their player token next to the bonus tiles, a player is allowed to either place a bonus disc on to a tile, or move one disc from one tile to another. If a disc is moved away away from a track, all progress made on that track is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bonus tiles are all intended for games with at least 3 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the players are using one or two bonus tiles, use 1 bonus disc per player.&lt;br/&gt;When the players are using three or four bonus tiles, use 2 bonus discs per player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ESSEN: CW &amp;amp; WC&lt;br/&gt;While many forget to eat anything at all, booth staff at ESSEN must occasionally have something to eat. When that happens, options are limited, but a Currywurst stand is never far. Motivated by the semblance of nourishment, morale rises, and the whole booth benefits. However, this is not without sometimes sudden and inevitable consequences...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When moving into the CW, and while a player&amp;rsquo;s disc is there, a player can always move ahead one step in turn order during the Cleanup phase - ie. if 3rd, they become 2nd. Their disc must remain in the CW and continues to give this benefit in each subsequent Cleanup phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A disc in CW may only be displaced when another player places a disc there. The displaced disc is placed in &amp;ldquo;WC&amp;rdquo;, where it must remain until it can be moved again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A disc in WC does not give any benefit. It may be moved again in one of two ways:&lt;br/&gt;When yet another player places a disc in CW, causing the disc there to be moved to WC, which frees the disc currently in WC.&lt;br/&gt;OR&lt;br/&gt;If there is still a disc in WC at the Cleanup phase of an afternoon round (2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th), it becomes available for use again in the next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
