			<description>Developed again by Clap Hanz, this is the third installment of the respected PlayStation golf series and the first entry on the PlayStation 2. It was released on July 26, 2001 in Japan and March 11, 2002 in North America. It was not released in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall look and feel of the game is pretty much the same as its predecessors, though refined visuals are a given. The same '3 click' system for hitting the ball is back. There are a number of different courses, characters, clubs, and ball types to choose from. New equipment can be purchased with experience points, which your characters earn by winning matches. Better equipment will ease up the game's difficulty a bit by providing greater accuracy, distance, and control. As an additional feature, the game has an international ranking system: With a password from the game you can post your scores on a website, where you can see how you measure up against everyone else out there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;John Daly is an unlockable golfer in this game, which makes him the first real life golfer to ever appear in the series. He only appeared in the American release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Hot Shots Golf 3&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
