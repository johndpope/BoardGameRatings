			<description>From the box copy:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game of Whipped!, you're a regular guy trying to hold onto your friends and the lady in your life. Your garage band may breakup when she throws out your guitar, or you may never hear from good old Chuck again after he sees you carrying her purse at the mall! Boost your male pride with an Iron John weekend, or flagellate yourself silly at the Relationship Counselor. Hilarious surprises and upsets abound in this light-hearted parody. If you haven't yet, it's time to get Whipped!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game description:&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with three &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; cards in play. The goal of the game is to be the last person with a friend in play. On a player's turn they draw their hand up to 7 cards and then play a card. Blue &amp;quot;Bond&amp;quot; cards are played on friends to &amp;quot;strengthen&amp;quot; the friendship. Pink &amp;quot;Whipped&amp;quot; cards are played to remove bond or friend cards from other players. Yellow special cards give you special actions (play all bonds in your hand, etc) and green special cards allow you to avoid or cancel a card played by another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
