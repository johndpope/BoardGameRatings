			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was cancelled in development. Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stomping Land managed to rise over $100,000 on Kickstarter. After losing contact with developer Alex &amp;quot;Jig&amp;quot; Fundora in late 2014, modeler Vlad Konstantinov halted his work on the game in January, and has now moved on to a different game altogether.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is assumed that Alex &amp;quot;Jig&amp;quot; Fundora pocketed the money and still owes Vlad Konstantinov payment, who actually had to pay the texture artist out of his own pocket. Most models made for the game have been sold off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
