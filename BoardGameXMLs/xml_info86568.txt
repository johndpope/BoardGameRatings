							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alligator Dice Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a game in Koplow's series of dice games that come in a tube and which usually feature dice where one side is replaced with a graphic of animal. In this case, you get five dice where the the one-pip is replaced with a graphic of an alligator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a simple dice rolling game - players roll the dice and need at least one alligator before they can score, They can set aside one alligator and other dice showing pipped sides which give the score - the other dice can be re-rolled once to attempt to improve the score. The player then decides whether to increase the size of their 'gator' by rolling all five dice and adding the sum of pipped dice to their score; however on this subsequent roll, any alligators rolled count as minus five points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest number of points after all the rolling wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
