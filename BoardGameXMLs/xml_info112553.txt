							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thrash Revised 2</name>
									
			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;The original Thrash is a Martial arts RPG created by Ewen &amp;lsquo;Blackbird&amp;rsquo; Cluney, and combined elements from the Street Fighter RPG, Mekton-Z, and Ninjas &amp;amp; Superspies to be as true-to-God to videogame martial arts as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thrash Revised was a revision of the game which took advantage of how open the system was and able to generate any anime character, thus being tailored into a generic anime system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, Thrash Revised 2 is an evolution of that route, the system enrouted towards a slightly more organized structure. The idea started as a customization of Thrash Revised for my Phantasy Star game setting, but I liked the finished product so much I decided to adopt it as new standard. Also, some modifications were made from the original template used in the Phantasy Star setting to polish the system some more and make it a bit more homogeneous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
