							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hadal Harrier</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each release for Crawthorne's Catalog of Creatures for the Pathfinder RPG presents a single, new creature for your Pathfinder RPG game, as presented by the famous and retired monster hunter and adventurer, Lord Crawthorne. Each release presents game stats for the new creature, as well as three adventure ideas to help insert them into your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hadal Harrier is a solitary, waterborne being that can only survive upon the flesh of the great white shark. This often forces them to sell their strength to others when they cannot find sufficient quarry on their own. Their incredible strength and ability to hole a ship with their blindingly-quick aquatic charge make them a deadly opponent for anyone in the water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
