			<description>In Ocean, players pilot fishing boats through a world reminiscent of the old &amp;quot;Wa-Tor&amp;quot; population dynamics simulation from A. K. Dewdney's Computer Recreations column in Scientific American.  There are three different kinds of breeding fish (represented by shells) that the players are trying to catch.  There are also sharks, a wave, and viruses that move around the board according to fixed rules in order to wreak havoc with your plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was originally published as Visjes in 1998.  Ocean is the 1999 re-release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    SeaSim&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
