							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Car Lesbians: Lesbian Car-racing Game</name>
									
			<description>Created by multiple unattributed contributors on the Traditional Games board (&amp;quot;/tg/&amp;quot;) of 4chan.org.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Car Lesbians is an exciting new game from /tg/ that can be played in as little as ten minutes or as long as a full campaign, depending on what the players and Dykemaster (DM) want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The premise is simple: you have a car and you are a lesbian. You must make out with other girls while riding in your car and making your car awesome. There are only two stats. These are Hotness and Car, and both are ranked 1-10 with normal people having a five in both (average looks / people carrier). Having a ten in each stat would make you smoking hot / give you a turbo-charged custom built Bond car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game uses a dice pool system: when you make a check, you roll a d6 for every point you have in that stat and count the number of successes. A 4 or 5 counts as one success, a roll of 6 counts as two successes, and each 1 is -1 success. If you get below 0 successes you have a critical failure; the DM will decide what happens next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
