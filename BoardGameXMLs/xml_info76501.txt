			<description>Subtitle: and Other Wondrous Items for Bookworms&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine a book so well written that it actually INCREASES your ability to use your skills. Now imagine an entire SET of such books! Well, now your players can experience them and more with this unique little PDF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This resource contains information on over two dozen non-magical books that grant competence bonuses to various skills and skills sets. Ideal for low-magic campaign settings, these books can literally become a campaign in and of themselves! Send the party off on a quest to find all the books. Or add one to treasure troves to set the party off looking for more. This booklet also includes a few magical surprises (like a portable library and a pen of scribing) to complete any adventurer's literary collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The contents of this booklet are open game content under the Open Game License (OGL copyright Wizards of the Coast).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
