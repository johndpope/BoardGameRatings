			<description>Title translates as &amp;quot;Twilight home: The Second Empire&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translated from the creator's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beyond the starts&lt;br/&gt;Where the fire is lit in the ashes&lt;br/&gt;The Goddess awaits&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's been 1700 years since our forefathers landed on Fo'ur. They lost everything: their freedom, their strength, their origin. It took us more than a millennium to regain the freeedom and strength and, and another half millenium to rebuild another empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was the mystery of our origin that got us up from Fo'ur, out beyond the residence of the Gods, and beyond the cold sun toward the stars. On almost every inhabitable world we found, there were remnants of a lost empire. On distant worlds there were silent and proud graves of a civilization long gone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In our unknown origin, we have an example to measure us, a warning from the past, and perhaps also the answer to the riddle that chased us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Who am I? From whence do I come?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the core rule book for the RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
