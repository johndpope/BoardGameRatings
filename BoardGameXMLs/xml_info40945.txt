			<description>Players place tiles with six segments into a larger puzzle, completing triangles in the process. Each segment has a number printed on them. The basic version is about getting triangles that are as valuable as possible. Another variant calls for meeting exact point requirements while completing triangles, which can be achieved by using the basic math operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a different game from Wittig's earlier Calculi that was published together with Trampoli in Edition Perlhuhn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
