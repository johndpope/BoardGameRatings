							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Les Templiers d&#039;Orven</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As newly dubbed Orven templars, your group of adventurers must explore 4 different dungeons and destroy the evil creatures dwelling there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Les Templiers d'Orven is a party-based role-playing game. The player creates a team of up to seven characters, buys equipment and chooses one of the four dungeons to explore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game interface is heavily inspired by Wizardry: a small window displaying the current location in wireframe 3d, a list of possible actions and a summary of the party members statistics. Character creation is semi-random, each character has a random starting score in each stat, which the player can improve by expanding points in one of the several available skills. The final character stats determine the character's class (guide, scribe, warrior or templar). Defeating monsters give experience points, necessary for levelling up, and gold pieces, useful for buying better equipment. Casting spells costs Concentration points, regained by resting or drinking potions. One of the spells allow the player to take control of one the opponents and add him to the party. Similarly, some monsters can take control of party members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the interesting features of the game is the possibility, while exploring a dungeon, to encounter and fight one of the player's previous adventuring parties converted to Evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
