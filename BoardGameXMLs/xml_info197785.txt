			<description>Word-O-Rama is a quiz or knowledge game for 3 or more players. Each player receives a pencil and a large pad printed with a 5x5 square. Like a bingo card, it has a &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; square in the middle, but there are spaces to the left for a vertical five-letter keyword, on top for 5 categories, and on the right for scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game box contains a spinner that goes from 1 to 75. To begin a game, the players make five spins to determine categories for the game. They spin one more time to determine the key word for the game. The rules include a table of 75 categories and 75 keywords.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players then start a 10-minute hourglass-style timer. Within that time limit, they try to write down for each category an answer that begins with the corresponding letter of the keyword. The rules show as an example a game with the category &amp;quot;animals&amp;quot; in the first column and the keyword CARDS: correct answers could include &amp;quot;camel&amp;quot; on the first (C) line and &amp;quot;dog&amp;quot; on the fourth (D) line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players get 10 points for each valid answer, but only if it is unique. If two players pick the same word, they get 5 points each, and if three or more think alike, no one gets any points. Players get a bonus of 10 points for each fully completed vertical, horizontal or diagonal line on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
