			<description>Galatune is an anime battle tabletop card game set on the fantasy planet of Lyra. The United World Government maintains peace and prosperity through the monopoly of advanced ancient technologies, but utopia comes at a steep cost. Will you join with the government to protect unity, or will you join the rebels and fight for freedom and independence?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-5 players each lead a Champion warrior into battle and earn a Victory Point each time an opponent is defeated. You win the game by being the first to earn 3 Victory Points by defeating 3 opponents. BUT there's a twist! The game doesn't end for you when your Champion falls in battle. Instead, you just get back up on your feet, respawn your Champion, and continue fighting! Think of it as a sort of card-based battle-royal, like a Battle Arena game, where you play for KOs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike other battle card games where players take their turns one-at-a-time, in Galatune everyone attacks simultaneously! It's an exciting formula that keeps the game moving and encourages players to predict and react to each other in real time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great game for first-time gamers or serious pros! Easy-to-Learn, impossible to master!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
