							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lore Core Rulebook</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website: Lore is a medieval-based fantasy role-playing game, and the starting point for GameFace Publishing. In Lore you'll discover a world of adventure, good versus evil, magic, mayhem, and mythical encounters to satisfy the most demanding gaming tastes. Melee is meant to take minutes, not hours. And while there are your races&amp;mdash; Elves, Dwarves, and Humans...what all gamers expect&amp;mdash;you'll also discover new societies and cultures you can play as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lore contains your standard class categories: martial, arcane, nature, and sacred; but with some unique sub-classes that will entice your imagination, set free your sense of drama, and express your alter-ego. Check the web site often, as we will reveal more as we count down to the official release of Lore!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure modules are set in a land known as Candlewood, a world where glory can be had, valor earned, treasures unearthed, mysteries to solve, and above all . . . Orcs killed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
