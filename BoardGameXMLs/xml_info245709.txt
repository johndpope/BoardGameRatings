							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Unknown Armies Book Five: Mine</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Book Five: Mine is a compilation of additional material for Unknown Armies, designed by a cabal of writers and prompted by backers of the wildly successful Unknown Armies Kickstarter in 2016. Herein you&amp;rsquo;ll discover new and, in many cases, revised rules and background for a dizzying array of miscellanea, salvaged from past editions and conjured into existence by dedicated fans of the work of Greg Stolze and John Scott Tynes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book is assembled into four chapters, in addition to this introduction. They are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adepts: Eight magickal schools, including some old favorites; a huge chunk of information about rituals; and a handful of artifacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avatars: Nine archetypes, updating several classics that were not included in Book One: Play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Places: Details on otherspaces, as well as a new category of archetype, the paragon place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faces: Antagonists and potential allies, including the Cult of the Cruel Ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just as with Book Four: Expose, the contents of this book are yours to accept, reject, twist, or turn as you desire. Nothing is canon unless it suits your own personal paradigm of Unknown Armies. But if you are ever looking to go beyond the core books and sample from that buffet of the unknown that is the occult underground and its many labyrinthine passages above and below, you may find what you most desire here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
