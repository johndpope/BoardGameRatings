			<description>Players try to buy lots on the game map. Lots will in urn bring the revenues. The lots that pay out are determined by dice.&lt;br/&gt;In the first phase, every player gets one lot for free&lt;br/&gt;In the second phase players can buy additional lots, using the revenues as money.&lt;br/&gt;In the last phase of the game, the lots pay dividends, but every turn there is a high chance that one random lot becomes worthless (i.e. contains a &amp;quot;Donnerloch&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;Players win when they buy certain combinations of lots or -if no one is able to - have the most money at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
