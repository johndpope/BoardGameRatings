			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fairies. In Costume. Having Adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use the awesome powers of these immortal nature spirits for whimsical ends in Costume Fairy Adventures! Gain special abilities by donning costumes and playing the role to the hilt. (Your fairy isn&amp;rsquo;t bright enough to know that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t work.) Warp reality by wishing really hard in service to the prank of the moment. And most importantly, get up to shenanigans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fairy adventures usually involve a small clique of friends dressing up to invade an otherwise sensible situation and unleash its potential for hilarious mayhem with pranks, stunts and nonsense. Using their innate sense for shenanigans or just doing whatever seems funny at the time, your fairies can make even the most boring village, ball or space fleet into the most interesting place in the universe. The inhabitants might not appreciate the brilliance of your efforts, but who cares so long as it's fun?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Costume Fairy Adventures Quickstart Edition allows you and your friends to take on the role of these tiny troublemakers and get up to proper mischief clad in fabulous costumes. While the full game packs in so much more &amp;ndash; extended rules, more Costumes and a variety of Playsets &amp;ndash; the Quickstart Edition has all you need to commit your first shenanigans and get a taste for the mayhem to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What You Need To Play&lt;br/&gt;In order to play Costume Fairy Adventures Quickstart Edition, you&amp;rsquo;ll need a few things before you start:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Characters. This edition doesn&amp;rsquo;t include character creation rules; however, pregenerated PCs are provided with this download. Let folks pick their characters, or just deal them out at random.&lt;br/&gt;     For face to face play, everyone will also need a pencil with a good eraser to record values that change during play. For online play, the relevant sections of your character sheets are form-fillable.&lt;br/&gt;     You&amp;rsquo;ll also need a handful of six-sided dice (around 5&amp;ndash;7). For online play, the forum or chat program you&amp;rsquo;re using may have a dice-roller utility, otherwise just let the GM handle the dice rolls.&lt;br/&gt;     Print and cut out a copy of the [Quickstart Costume Deck]. For online play, physical Costume cards may be useful for ease of reference. The GM should always have a copy in order to keep track of the Costumes.&lt;br/&gt;     Finally, you&amp;rsquo;ll need tokens to represent Magic points (about ten per player). You can use glass beads, poker chips, or even small candies, like gourmet jelly beans. We recommend using Magic tokens &amp;ndash; edible or otherwise &amp;ndash; even if you&amp;rsquo;re playing online since we find that the tactile element of handling (or eating) them adds to the experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
