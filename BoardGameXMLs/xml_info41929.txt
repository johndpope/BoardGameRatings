							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Word Hunt</name>
									
			<description>A different sort of word card game, where word fragments are combined in a search for valid English words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It contains a deck of about 60 orange cards, each with 1-3 letters that start a word; and about 120 yellow cards, each with 2-4 letters for the end of a word.  When an orange card is placed atop and at right angles to a yellow card, the letters combine to form a potential word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the main game, players are each dealt 2 yellow cards.  In a turn, a player draws 1 orange card from the draw or discard pile, and lays it on each of his yellow cards, pronouncing the &amp;quot;word&amp;quot; aloud.  Each yellow card that is part of a real word is turned down and saved, and replaced from the yellow deck; finally the orange card is discarded.  At the end of the game, the player with the most won yellow cards wins.  Players may be challenged if they fail to speak a word aloud, pronounce it wrong, or declare a nonexistent word; the loser of a challenge gives the winner one of his won yellow cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Tic-Tac-Toe game, 9 yellow cards are dealt into a 3x3 array.  In a turn a player draws 1 orange card and lays it on an empty yellow card to form a word, placing one of his tokens on it; if it cannot be placed to make a real word, it's discarded.  A player wins on getting 3 tokens in a row; then the cards are discarded and a new yellow array is dealt.  Presumably, play continues until a certain number of games is won or time is expired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
