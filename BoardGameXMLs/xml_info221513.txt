			<description>Hidden identities with opposing goals compete for trick-taking galaxy supremacy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are given hidden identity cards: The &amp;quot;Envoy&amp;quot; scores points for other people making their bid, the &amp;quot;Saboteur&amp;quot; scores for others failing, and everybody else scores for making their own. The deck size changes depending on the player count (3, 4, or 5) so every game is balanced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After being dealt their hands and hidden identities, each player bids the number of tricks they will take using gems. Color-coded gems make it easy to see if the bid is under, full, or over. One player may be a saboteur, so you cannot count on every bid being legitimate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hand is played out in trick. The Solar suit is always trump. As players take tricks they place their gems on the piles so the status of all bids is apparent to all. After the last trick is taken every player reveals their identity and scores points accordingly. Players move their corresponding cube on the score track until one player makes it to 30 points to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STORY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Centuries of multilateral conflicts throughout the galaxy are being resolved at the diplomatic conference of the era: The Congress of Zienna. Borderlines will be drawn and the resources of entire systems will be acquired. Empires, alliances, and multi-planetery corporations struggle for power --- not in battle but at the negotiating table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a representative of a galactic power sent to Zienna Prime. Your goal at the negotiating table depends on your hidden identity:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Envoy - Galactic peace alliances benefit from stability and mutual success. The Envoy's goal is to help all parties get what they want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saboteur - Hired by nefarious provocateurs seeking conflict, the saboteur is sent to prevent the negotiations from being a success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solo Agent - Representing the interests of a single client state or corporation, agents work to maximise acquisitions with no regard for competitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
