							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Potato Land</name>
									
			<description>Potato Land is a very fun collectible strategy game like &amp;quot;Gwent&amp;quot; from &amp;quot;The Witcher&amp;quot;. There are from two to eight players. You choose one of four opposition parties. You win if you have more points than your friends. Some cards have special effects: control of the weather, double of points, draw of additional cards, steal of cards of opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game becomes tense with every card which you put on the table. After all if you have fewer cards in the hand, you can absurdly lose this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
