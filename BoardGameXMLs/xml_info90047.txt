							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Civilization World</name>
									
			<description>Civilization World is a Facebook based Civilization game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Sid Meier:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Civ World games will have a well-defined beginning and end, each ending with a triumphant civilization and one person recognized as that game&amp;rsquo;s most prestigious player. Along the way, as you progress through the different eras of time, you'll have the chance to win era victories as well. We want players to have both a final goal to work towards, as well as short-term objectives to achieve as they play. The trophies you unlock with your triumphs will carry over from game to game, and you can show them off in your throne room.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
