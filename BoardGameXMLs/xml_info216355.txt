			<description>While the instructions say that two or more may play, each player needs 5 cards and there must be a draw pile, so, with 72 cards in the deck, there is a limit in how many may play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the game is to find &amp;quot;units&amp;quot; in your hand. A unit is &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    fractions that add up to 1&lt;br/&gt;    percents that add up to 100%&lt;br/&gt;    fractions and percents that together add up to a unit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card can be added either as a fraction or a percent. Some cards give the percent as the larger number, with the fraction as the smaller number, and some do the reverse. Each card also has a circle with a &amp;quot;pie wedge&amp;quot; that shows the given percent/fraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are shuffled and each player is dealt five cards. The rest of the cards form the draw pile. The top card is turned face up to form the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, a player takes one card, either from the top of the draw pile or from the top of the discard pile. With their cards, the player tries to make a unit. Each card can be used only once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player finds a unit, they lay it down, face up, and explains how it makes a unit. Then they put the unit into their &amp;quot;unit pile&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player lays down a unit, they draw from the draw pile until they have six cards again (if they did not make a unit, they will have six cards, and will not need to draw).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lastly, the player discards a card on the discard pile. Then it is the next player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all of the cards are gone from the draw pile, the players continue to play as long as they can, drawing from the discard pile only. They cannot fill their hands and do not need to discard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the one with the most units in their unit pile. Alternately, the winner may be the one with the greatest number of cards in their unit pile, whichever is agreed upon beforehand by the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
