							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Superstring Multiverse Worldbook 1</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the history of superhero comics, the concept of a multiverse has been used by numerous publishers to allow for characters to go on non-canon adventures, explore story options that would dramatically alter the primary narrative of the heroes and ask the question, &amp;ldquo;what if...?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superstring Multiverse is an attempt to recreate that freedom in your M&amp;amp;M tabletop game. Utilizing the characters from our Superhero Support line of products as a base starting point, we have decided to craft a vast and complicated multiverse of parallel worlds and infinite options to integrate into your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superstring Multiverse Worldbook 1 expands upon the core concepts introduced in the Superstring Multiverse Core Supplement by introducing two new worlds on the Superstring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First is World 10 - The Pantheon, a world in which the superheroes have been elevated to divine regard, acting as a super-powered world authority and keeping watch over humanity from their flying city of New Olympus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also covered is World 11 - Astro-Shifters, a world in which all superpowers are drawn from bizarre mystical energies that shift and change, altering a portion of the populace in unpredictable and chaotic ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These worlds are presented in the format introduced in the Superstring Multiverse Core Supplement and occupy spaces 10 and 11 in the Multiverse, for purposes of Hyperspace Travel. Each of these worlds can be used as destinations to be visited in a Multiverse-spanning campaign, or as the setting for an entire storyline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
