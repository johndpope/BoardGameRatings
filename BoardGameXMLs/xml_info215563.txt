			<description>The Problem Picnic: Attack of the Ants Mini-Expansion includes a few small expansion picnic cards originally offered as stretch goals for the Kickstarter campaign, but were not reached. As a result, these were offered again as an add-on after the campaign, so fans could get them anyway:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Bluebird&lt;br/&gt;     Wine Bottle, which includes a cardboard wine bottle obstacle and stands.&lt;br/&gt;     Frisbee, which includes a cardboard Kids Table Flyin' Disc.&lt;br/&gt;     Blueberry Pie, which includes a cardboard pie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
