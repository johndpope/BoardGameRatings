							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Conker&#039;s Pocket Tales</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Conker's Pocket Tales is a game released by Rareware in 1999. It is an overhead action game, starring Rare character Conker the Squirrel in a dual-format cartridge that served as both an original Game Boy game and a Game Boy Color game. While the two versions both co-existed on the same cartridge, only one could be played on the appropriate system. Several differences were noticeable in the layouts of worlds; some see Conker's Pocket Tales as two games in one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot&lt;br/&gt;Conker's girlfriend , Berri, decides to throw Conker a surprise birthday party. However, the Evil Acorn jumps out of the cake and kidnaps Berri and steals the presents. Conker has to save Berri and get his presents back. In the end, Conker rescues Berri, and the Evil Acorn gets blown away by an explosion in his base that Conker and Berri escaped from, when flying into space, the Evil Acorn claims that he will return but he has not returned yet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History&lt;br/&gt;The game is lighthearted in nature, and designed to appeal to younger gamers. It was intended to serve as a precursor to the planned Nintendo 64 title Twelve Tales: Conker 64, however it ultimately ended up being massively re-tooled into Conker's Bad Fur Day and its Xbox remake Conker: Live and Reloaded, an &amp;quot;adult&amp;quot; title featuring profanity, graphic violence and scatological humor.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Conker's_Pocket_Tales,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
