							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Slayer&#039;s Guide to Female Gamers</name>
									
			<description>What, in truth, do we know about female gamers? Those few who have encountered them over the years have been left baffled; some even psychologically damaged by the experience. The very nature of the Female Gamer may be so inhuman, so unknowable, so terrifying that it causes mental damage, hysteria and sometimes drooling. Reports of their nature are therefore sketchy, incomplete and often written in non-toxic crayon on circles of paper. Biblical scholars of the frothy and spectacularly be-bearded bent define them as evil; citing the mythical figure Eve from the bible as proof positive they are all foul and seductive temptresses who are on this earth to lead men astray from the path of righteousness and impressionable choirboys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crammed full of fascinating, nay essential, information about those mysterious creatures who sometimes show up at your gaming group but who look strangely different to everybody else. Marvel as we introduce you to the Historical Role of Female Gamers; gape at the Female Gamer Physiology; prepare to be taken aback by their physical attributes and then look in awe upon the likes of Zeenar, Warrior Dyke, the Ladette and the Velvet Goldmine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
