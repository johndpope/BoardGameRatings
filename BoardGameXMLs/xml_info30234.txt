			<description>The equipment for Multimatch I is a set of MacMahon's Three-Color Squares. This contains 24 squares representing all ways to divide a square into four equal triangles (with short edges along the square's diagonals) and color the triangles with 3 colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wade E. Philpott sold a cardboard set of squares, including rules for several games and puzzles, beginning in 1966. Kadon distributed it beginning in 1982 and started producing an acrylic version in 1989.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second edition Kadon rulebook (dated 1991) contains rules for 4 games, plus variants. The first three were originally designed by Philpott, although they have been changed slightly over the years; Closure was not in the original set and was presumably designed by Kate Jones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multimatch. Players take turns placing tiles on the 5x5 gameboard. Edges must match and the first piece placed on a border of the board determines the color of that border. Last player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bingo. Players take turns placing tiles on the 5x5 grid, attempting to be the first to create a row of 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outmatched. Players divide the tiles equally (face-down) and then race to assemble their group into a rectangle, with tile edges matching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Closure. The tiles are assembled into a random (but edge-matching) group. Players take turns &amp;quot;closing&amp;quot; one of the 3 colors by moving as few tiles as possible. Closing a color requires leaving no exposed edges of that color. Moves may not separate any tiles from the group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
