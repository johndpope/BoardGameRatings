			<description>Introduction text:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nemesis is designed to combine the speed and deadliness of the One Roll Engine (as seen in Godlike and Wild Talents ) and the Madness Meter (as seen in Unknown Armies ) to recreate an atmosphere found in horror classics Nemesis is dark horror, designed to emulate the works of H.P. Lovecraft, Stephen King, Ambrose Bierce, Brian Lumley, and William Peter Blatty, as well as settings such as Delta Green and the Gilchrist Trust, in a roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is designed to cover every period of game play from the early 20 th century to the modern day, and contains rules covering magic, monsters, vehicles and weaponry. It is a complete gaming resource for playing everything from a 1920s adventure into darkest Africa to a Delta Green investigation into a downed alien spacecraft. In short, it is a toolkit designed to answer the call for an updated horror game engine. We call this optimized engine Dark ORE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
