			<description>From Patch's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Heat up game night with this sizzling dice game! Toss the one-of-a-kind dice into the innovative Twist &amp;amp; Tumble Dice Cup, twist, and watch the dice tumble out! Create a line of color or number matches that will score big or make others lose big. In this game, you definitely want to Shizzle, and it&amp;rsquo;s better if you don&amp;rsquo;t fizzle!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turn rolling the dice and try to create a line of dice where the next die in line matches the previous by color or number. The more dice in your line, the more points you earn! You can reroll unused dice as many times as you want as long as you're always adding to the line. If not, you choke and lose all the points you've earned that turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the bank is out of chips. The player with the most points at the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
