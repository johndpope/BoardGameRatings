			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gentlemen and ladies: start your engines!  Turn your Atari into a high performance Formula 1 racing machine.  You will be going up against the most skillful drivers at your choice of 5 different courses: Indy, Monza, Monaco, Watkins Glen and &amp;quot;The Killer&amp;quot;.  It will take time for you to get familiar with your speed machine, so at first the three computer-driven racers will leave you in their dust.  The day will come when you know how to take turns at full throttle, how to pass on the straightaway and how to slide around the hairpin turns.  You will have mastered the 5-gear transmission, the hazardous oil slicks, and even night driving.  Then you can &amp;quot;go for the gusto&amp;quot;.  But look out... you can crash into the numerous trees and explode your dreams to success and yourself as well.  You can power yourself right off the track if you don't slow down in some of the turns.  So go get your racing scarf, put on your crash helmet and step on the gas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four levels of play, plus night driving option and choice of 1 to 10 laps per race.  With high speed graphics and authentic sounds.  At the finish of each race, the computer will give you split times per laps, final time and finishing place against your three computer rivals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Sid Meier&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
