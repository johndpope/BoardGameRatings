			<description>INTRODUCTION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attention, Heroes! The law-abiding citizens of mid-western Hometown, USA need you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super villains from nearby Colossal City have come to expand their criminal enterprises. Their minions are wreaking havoc on this once peaceful town, and someone must rise up to challenge the masked mayhem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the only people capable of thwarting these diabolical criminals. Though you are but a handful of courageous citizens, you possess unique powers and abilities that give Hometown its best hope for salvation. You are the Hometown Heroes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OVERVIEW&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hometown Heroes is a Superhero-themed card game by Roger Alan Cotton for two players, ages 11 to adult. Play Time ranges from 30 to 90 minutes, depending on how many episodes are played. The starter version of the game comes with seven Comic Book Issues, made up of twenty-one episodes. Expansions will introduce new comic book issues, episodes, and characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME CONCEPT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players play out a &amp;quot;comic book issue,&amp;quot; which is comprised of three Episodes. Each episode lists objectives worth different amounts of Victory Points. The player whose team of superheroes or super villains completes objectives worth the highest number of Victory Points by the end of the comic book issue, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME SET UP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Decide who will play the Heroes team and who will play the Villains team. The Villains Player always starts the game as the Active Player, with the Heroes Player starting as the Reacting Player. After the first turn, the players switch statuses. This continues until the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Decide which Comic Book Issue you will be playing. Place this Issue Card off to the side on the play area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Each player receives the Comic Book Issue Card's three corresponding Episode Cards. Episode cards are double-sided; with one side listing the Heroes Player's objectives, and the other side listing the Villains Player's objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. The Heroes Player selects five heroes to be in his super team, while the Villains Player selects seven villains and henchmen. These characters are represented by Hero / Villain Cards (which are placed face-up in front of their respective players, on the game play area).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. Place all (9) of your selected characters' corresponding Action Cards into your Actions Decks, along with the (9) base Action Cards that correspond with your alignments.  Then, shuffle the decks. These decks are made up of Actions Cards that represent attacks, defenses, maneuvers, and general actions (like Lifting and Tracking) performed by specific characters in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME TURN SEQUENCE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Hand Formation / Action Card Draw&lt;br/&gt;2. Initiative Determination&lt;br/&gt;3. Action Resolution&lt;br/&gt;4. Episode Completion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HAND FORMATION / ACTION CARD DRAW Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At start of game, draw (5) cards from your Action Deck to form your Hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of each of your successive turns, draw only enough cards to refill your Hand back up to (5) cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INITIATIVE DETERMINATION Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regardless of whose turn it is, the Action Card in either of your Hands with the highest Initiative Value gets to go first. If there are one or more Action Cards with equal Initiative Values, the Active Player's actions are resolved first. Initiative then continues to the character in either Hand with the next fastest Initiative Value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACTION RESOLUTION Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All actions have an Initiative Value ranging from 1 to 10. An action with an Initiative Value of 10 is the fastest action, while actions with an Initiative Value of 1 are the slowest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Active Player starts the action by asking if the Reacting Player has any Action Cards in his Hand that have an Initiative Value of 10. If not, the Active Player may play as many Initiative-10 actions from his Hand as he wishes (depending on availability).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unless the Reacting Player can prevent the Active Player's cards from taking effect, these actions are resolved and can be used to attack enemy characters, or to complete the objectives on the current Episode Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: If both players have actions with the same Initiative Values, the Active Player's actions always get resolved before the Reacting Player's actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the Active Player has played all of the cards in his Hand that he can play, his turn ends. The Reacting Player cannot play any further cards until the start of his own turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCORING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As your characters complete Episode Card objectives, you gain Victory Point Counters equal to the objectives' VP Values. As you gain these counters, keep them on the game play area, next to your characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You also gain (1) Victory Point for every enemy character that is Knocked Out at the end of the game, as well as (3) Victory Points for every enemy character you have captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
