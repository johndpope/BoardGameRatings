			<description>Like the original Take Your Pick, this is a party game where one player is the subject and everyone else draws three cards, each of which has two choices on it A or B.  The judges orient their cards in their hands such that they select one option from each card (turn the card one way, and the top word is circled, rotate it 180 degrees and the other word is circled).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In turn, each judge calls out the two words on one of his cards to the subject, who answers his preference.  If the judge was correct, he keeps the card and continues.  Wrong, and his turn ends.  The subject gets the same score as the judge who got the most points this turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick and entertaining, which is what SimplyFun party games seem to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This edition includes entertainment choices (Batman or Spiderman, P Diddy or Led Zeppelin, etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
