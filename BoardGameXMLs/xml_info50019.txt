			<description>From cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reality as we know it is a lie. An illusion fabricated to keep humanity at bay and prevent our awakening. Behind its facade something vaster and darker awaits - the true reality. Where heaven and hell fights to replace a vanishing god who may be dead. Humans are pulled into that Struggle as the illusion crumbles. Weakened by time and humanity&amp;rsquo;s lost faith. More and more people gain the ability to see beyond the illusion and start disbelieving old truths. The laws of nature prove to be weaker than what we once thought. Magic is a reality, and nothing turns out to be what it seems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kult is a contemporary fiction universe set in the world of large, dark, industrial cities. A world where human wickedness mingles with terror from other parts of a true, unseen reality. Sensitive people are crushed by the anonymity of the cities, and become psychotics. Under the surface, primitive passions are still held at bay by the morality of past civilizations growing and festering until they erupt in sick Perversions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But human darkness is not all that threatens. The evil that humans do corrodes the boundaries of reality and admits creatures from the other side. Our dreams assume physical form and chase us. Creatures from the past are reborn into the present, to re-arrange our lives. Our own fear gives birth to beings that threaten to devour us. Occult teachings can be used to establish openings into different worlds, and tap power from the unknown, but few if any humans realize the truth about the powers they conjure up. Sooner or later, they are all consumed by demons they cannot control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kult is a complete role-playing system written in four detailed sections. This second American edition features a more streamlined system and book for quicker and more enjoyable play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lie: This section helps players create detailed and unique characters with the use of advantages, disadvantages, dark secrets, and plenty of skills. Players are provided archetypes and a simplified character generation system so they can jump right into the game with little effort. A new, efficient and quick combat system helps Gamemasters run sessions with few interruptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rumours: With this section Gamemasters can bring the real world to life with detailed chapters on dealing with accidents, time, and meeting with horrific events. It provides suggestions on running adventures and campaigns, and how to create an atmosphere of horror. It also contains a fresh and focused Magic system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Truth: This section provides you with the dark background of the world in which your players will live. Our jailers and their minions are detailed, as is their most dreaded power, The Dark Art; with which they create and manipulate our very world and everything within it to their terrible desires. Nothing is what it seems, and a hideous game is being played out just beyond our sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Beginning: We end this book where you begin. An introductory adventure...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
