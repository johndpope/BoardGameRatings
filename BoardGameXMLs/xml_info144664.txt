			<description>First puzzling - and then play! First, the children get used to weekdays, months and seasons by playing. On the track assembled from puzzle pieces then they also can play the dice game &amp;quot;The Great Calendar Rally&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of two parts: in the first part you put together the playfield from puzzle parts. It consists of a circle with the twelve months (each a single part of the puzzle) and kind of a &amp;quot;bridge&amp;quot; of the seven days of the week (again each weekday a single part of the puzzle) - there you can describe the months, the four seasons and the days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second part the winner has to collect the most chips during a race through the months. A dice determines the number of months to go, you have to name them as you pass by. The game stops when the two chips of every month have been collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
