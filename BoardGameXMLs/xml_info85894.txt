							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ship Names for the Whole Fleet</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every good ship needs a strong name, in fact, it&amp;rsquo;s bad luck to sail a ship that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a name or to rename a ship that has already sailed. Besides, what is the party&amp;rsquo;s lookout going to yell when their arch nemesis comes into view - &amp;ldquo;Bad ship off the port side?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this reason and because giving names to your world&amp;rsquo;s ships makes it feel more like a living world, your friends here at Healing Fireball Publications have created a group of tables suitable for naming all the ships in your world. From the darkest pirate vessel to the traders just trying to make a living to the stout military vessels defending their borders, you will find a name to suit all your needs. This collection of three tables contains 50 ship names designed for use with either pirate ships, merchant vessels or military ships. This product also contains a short list of common ship prefixes, such as SS, LB and HMS as well as their meanings, to put in front of the generated name to give it a more seaworthy feel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
