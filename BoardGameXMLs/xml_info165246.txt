							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Temple of the Dead God</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not an adventurer, don&amp;rsquo;t even try this. But, yes, this is the entrance, this is the door. Take the rope at the top of the canyon &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;ll drop you straight down to the temple of the dead god &amp;ndash; some say a god outside of time. No matter. The temple&amp;rsquo;s outside time too, but trust the rope. It&amp;rsquo;ll make the trip. Once you get to the temple you&amp;rsquo;ll see some toys pieces you&amp;rsquo;ve met before slotting into place. The Old Fool and the Elf King are here, and some cloistered undead too, all watched over by Velistina, a friend of Edward Fulton, the captain of the Astral Star. She&amp;rsquo;s watching for shenanigans the Godslayer might pull trying to escape from Pirate Island. Don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled. He&amp;rsquo;ll use this door if he can. And if he can slay a god, what might he do to flesh like you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
