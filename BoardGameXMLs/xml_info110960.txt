							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Darklands (Lone Wolf MGB)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Darklands, the book about this most terrible country and the vile beings that rule that blasted scar on the face of Magnamund. This text will definitively list the Darklords in all their ebon glory, with their powers, their provinces, and their legions in detail. By the time you have finished reading this tome of terror, you will know the ways of evil on Magnamund much better than you did before. You will know which Darklord rules in the domain of Nightmares, which one revels in the applications of torture, and what horrors churn to be awakened in the underhalls of Helgedad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To defeat the Darklords and stop the press of evil, great legends will have to arise. Great powers will have to be mastered. More importantly, great heroes must answer the call of battle. Can you be such a champion? Can you resist the lure of evil power and fight for the Light? And ultimately, will you have the courage to venture where the road of heroes must eventually go?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dare you enter the Darklands?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
