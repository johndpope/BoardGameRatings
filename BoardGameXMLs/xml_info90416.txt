							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Politics of Terror</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A maverick politician is targeted by the Mob! Can the player characters defeat the Politics of Terror?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adamant Entertainment is proud to present the first chapter in our first Serial Adventure, Crimson Emperor. Part of the Thrilling Tales line of pulp products for modern D20, the Serial Adventure is a five-part extended campaign, written by Walt Ciechanowski, and intended for a group of 1 to 3 player-characters of 9th through 11th level. The five weekly chapters of the Crimson Emperor can be played as parts of a larger story arc, or as stand-alone adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this first installment, the players are drawn into an attempt by mobsters to put an end to the political career of maverick politician Senator Stuart &amp;quot;Steamboat Stu&amp;quot; Morrison. This will lead them on a journey that will, through the course of the other chapters of the Serial Adventure, bring them from the dark alleys of Chinatown, to a hidden valley in Tibet, and from the fortress of a self-styled Emperor to the very Halls of Power in Washington D.C.!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
