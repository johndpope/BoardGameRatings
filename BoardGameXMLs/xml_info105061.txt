							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Munchkin Jolly Jumbo D6</name>
									
			<description>Munchkin: Jolly Jumbo D6 is an expansion for any of the numerous Munchkin games and it comes in two colors: red and green. The packs include a 25mm die (colored red or green respectively) and four new cards (two Doors and two Treasures, with different cards in each pack). In addition, a special rule is written on the card stock backing of the package. See the publisher's note about this card stock rule before opening the package.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that the publisher has released several additional variants of the Jolly Jumbo d6, in various color schemes. These dice do not come in a package, have no special rules, and do not include any cards. They aren't available through standard retail channels and must be purchased directly from Warehouse 23, the Steve Jackson Games online store. For the purposes of BGG versions and collection tracking, these dice lacking rules and cards are mere accessories and should not be listed with this entry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See the individual board game versions for a description of the cards and special rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the Munchkin series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
