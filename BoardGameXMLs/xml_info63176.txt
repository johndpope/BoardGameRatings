			<description>In this version of Brin de Jasette (French for &amp;quot;A Bit of Bander&amp;quot;), the active player choose a question from his or her card and read it loud. Each question ask something from the active player. Here are some examples:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;What would I bring on a desert island?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;If I would design a new computer program, what would it does?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;What makes me look cool?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player now answer loud to the active player, who has to give secret points for each answer. He can give 0 to 10 points. After one round (each player was active once), players reveal their point. If one has 30 (or more), he wins. If not, you make another round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
