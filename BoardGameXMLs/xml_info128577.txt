							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cretan Labyrinth</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The labyrinth, an imposing structure, especially if you are unaware that it consists actually of only one single non branching path leading from the exterior entrance to its center. But even although you can't actually get lost inside, it still plays havoc with your senses. Its uniform walls and its many twists and turns can make even the most steadfast loose their sense of direction. And among the countless floor tiles and indistinguishable stones of the walls it is hard to mark progress or find traps. In addition sound echos in unnerving ways through the narrow hallways. And what one hears might be beyond the next turn, the one after it or it could be approaching from behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map is available free of charge to celebrate the 100th release in the Battlemaps series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
