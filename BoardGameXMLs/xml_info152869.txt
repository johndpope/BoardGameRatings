			<description>Up and Down is played with one or two Mystique Decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup:&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the cards and divide them into equal high face down piles for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes the top 4 cards of his pile and places them face up in front of him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game rules:&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest card (card number) starts by playing this card. If there is a tie (when playing with two decks) the player with the golden card start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After playing a card, players always refill their hand by placing the top card of their pile face up next to their other face up cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting with the second card, only cards fitting the following criteria can be played:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card shares the colour or the suit of the last card played&lt;br/&gt;The card number (1-5) is higher/lower than or equal to the number of the last card played (at the beginning of the game it must be higher or equal)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player does not have a fitting card, he must pass. But if he can play a card, he must.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;If all players successively have passed, the direction (higher/lower) is changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the rare case that all players still have to pass again, the player with the highest card begins as if a new game would start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End of the game:&lt;br/&gt;As soon as a player would be allowed to refill his hand, but has no more card in his draw pile, he wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
