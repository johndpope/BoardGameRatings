			<description>From the Box:The Old Course, St. Andrews&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one knows who the first golfer was but everyone knows where he played: The Old Course, St. Andrews, Scotland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first mention of the game was in 1457 and ever since then a succession of great champions have wrestled to master The Old Course. Now, the latest in a long line of champions, Seve Ballesteros, winner of the 1984 Open, here at St. Andrews, plays The Old Course as Touring Professional of The Old course Golf and Country Club.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Old course Hotel, as it then was, was acquired by a major British public company in 1982 and a multi-million pound refurbishment programme was completed in April 1983 creating 150 luxury five star rooms, a health spa, restaurants and many other luxury amenities for the exclusive use of members of The Old Course Golf and Country Club.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The club offers a unique membership which gives members a passport to unparalleled golf facilities the world over and which includes many of the finest resorts both in europe and in the U.S.A., with luxurious, complimentary accomodation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jack Nicklaus, Bernhard Langer and Sean Connery are but a few of the well known members of this, the most prestigious club in the world-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Old Course Golf and Country Club, St. Andrews.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game: Played on full colour scale drawings of The Old Course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
