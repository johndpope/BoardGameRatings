			<description>In Boinnnggg, each player is rolling dice to move their four plastic discs around the board onto either frog or flower spaces.  When a flower space is reached, a player attempts to flick the disc onto a central flower-themed tower.  Landing a piece on the top level or middle level will earn points, while landing directly under the flower will earn no points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until the first player has landed all four of their discs onto or under the tower, with the winner being the player who scored the highest number of points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Frogs hop around this quiet pond, until one all of a sudden attempts to jump to the big central flower. Try to get all your frogs onto the flower in the middle but watch out, the first to get there does not necessarily win the game!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
