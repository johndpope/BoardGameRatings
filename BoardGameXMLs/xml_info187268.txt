							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Chuubo&#039;s Marvelous Wish Granting Engine Halloween Special</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you love the Chuubo&amp;rsquo;s Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine RPG, and who doesn't? Then you'll want to pick up this marvelous introduction to its &amp;quot;Fairy Tales&amp;quot; genre---&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An 80-XP campaign for 2-4 players featuring:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-The Headmaster, a Halloween-obsessed drunk;&lt;br/&gt;-The Ideologue, led astray by the &amp;quot;Blood Fang&amp;quot; books;&lt;br/&gt;-The Idol, who doesn't really want to be this story's hero; and&lt;br/&gt;-The Exchange Student, from the Halloween World on the other side of the mirror...&lt;br/&gt;as well as extensive notes as to how a Fairy Tales campaign plays out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is meant for use as a one-shot campaign for new or experienced players, and some game features have been simplified and some choices constrained in pursuit of that end. Much of the book's Halloween-themed art has appeared previous to this product, but you know you want to buy it anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need the Chuubo&amp;rsquo;s Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine RPG, or, at least, someone in your group had better have the Chuubo&amp;rsquo;s Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine RPG, to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy! And happy holidays!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
