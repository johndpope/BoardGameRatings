			<description>Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Megacity and welcome to your new job: bus driver!&lt;br/&gt;Get behind the steering wheel of one of the many different bus models and master one of the countless tracks in the fictional city Megacity.&lt;br/&gt;But keep and eye on the timeplan and transport as many passengers as possible. Reckless driving or unpunctuality will result in a bad reputation and penalty fees.&lt;br/&gt;Only when you keep the schedule, you can arrive at the bus stop when the most passengers are waiting. Too early or too late and you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to sell that many tickets.&lt;br/&gt;Depending on your success and reputation, the tracks get more difficult, longer and more complex.&lt;br/&gt;Choose between different bus models, 8 different bus models are already included, more can be downloaded via the internet. But remember, only paying passengers will result in enough cashflow necessary to run the bus company.&lt;br/&gt;Buy or rent larger busses, keep the service running and check up on all busses. Or invest in ad campains or special offers to attract more customers.&lt;br/&gt;Extra income can be generated by renting ad spaces on the busses.&lt;br/&gt;A total of 18 completely different tracks through different districts (suburbs, downtown, industrial, business center etc.) offer long hours of fun and challenges.&lt;br/&gt;Prepare yourself for driving in all types of weather conditions (sunshine, snow, ice, rain, fog), different daytimes and the number of passengers depending on the daytime and weather as well.&lt;br/&gt;To show what you are made of, you can try to get into the world-wide highscore list.&lt;br/&gt;No matter if you are beginner or pro, this simulation challenges everybody.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;18 different tracks in a huge megacity&lt;br/&gt;34 different missions&lt;br/&gt;8 different bus models in 4 classes, downloadable buses via internet&lt;br/&gt;Tycoon elements (ad spaces, buying/renting of buses, ticket prices, promotion offers etc.)&lt;br/&gt;huge city model with traffic, pedestrians and lots of details&lt;br/&gt;different camera views including bus driver view (cockpit view)&lt;br/&gt;help system for beginners&lt;br/&gt;highscore list and online highscore system&lt;br/&gt;different daytimes and weather conditions&lt;br/&gt;easy to use interface&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
