			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a band of hardy adventures a little snow is only a minor inconvenience, however in the &amp;quot;Frozen Wilderness&amp;quot; where danger lurks behind every tree a little snow may be the difference between life and death. Who knows what tracks have been covered by this latest flurry, perhaps a group a bandits wait to ambush unwary travelers as they cross the bridge, or maybe the ice covering the stream is not quite thick enough for an adventurer weighed down with loot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map shows a path through the wilderness, cutting across a frozen river towards a secluded hut, smoke rising from a cooking fire - who knows what may lurk inside!. It has also been designed to work in conjunction with our new &amp;quot;Frozen Wilderness&amp;quot; Vinyl Game Mat so that you can expand your gaming!&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Evermelt&amp;quot; Vinyl Game Mat 20&amp;quot;x 30&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This high-quality vinyl surface is ideal for staging encounters during your adventures! The mat lies flat for ease of play and is sold in sturdy polycarbonate tube for easy storage and transport. The mat may be marked with WET-ERASE markers to temporarily alter terrain areas or make other notes about battlefield conditions during play. The Game Mat measure 20&amp;rdquo; x 30&amp;rdquo; and is marked with a 1&amp;rdquo; grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
