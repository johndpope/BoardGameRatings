							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Smithsonian Artifact or Fiction</name>
									
			<description>From Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is that Smithsonian fact unbelievably true or outrageously false? Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell the difference! Each player takes turns writing down the correct answer to a question, along with one they made up. Everyone guesses which answer they believe is a fact and which one is fiction. The player who gets most tokens by guessing correctly or bluffing the best wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- It&amp;rsquo;s a trivia game with a twist. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to have the correct answer just the most believable one!&lt;br/&gt;- Fascinating facts and pictures accompany each question&lt;br/&gt;Rewards creative thinking and creative writing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes:&lt;br/&gt;290 Cards&lt;br/&gt;60 Tokens&lt;br/&gt;1 Answer Pad&lt;br/&gt;6 Pencils&lt;br/&gt;1 Set of Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
