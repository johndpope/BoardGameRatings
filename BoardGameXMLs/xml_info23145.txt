			<description>Intro ~ Adrian &amp;amp; Adeline Halabaster, and the celebration of Halloween, are synonymous as this popular pair are known for hosting the most elaborate and exciting Halloween extravaganzas! Their costumes and makeup have always been unbelievably creative, their decorations are extraordinary and the incredulous atmosphere this talented duo has been able to create year after year leave their guests completely in awe&amp;hellip;.and this year is no exception&amp;hellip;..well&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;except for the&amp;hellip;.murders!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what happened?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adrian has a charming tradition that he carries out every year.  At the start of each party and with a very special champagne ordered specifically for this occasion, he would signal for everyone's attention, tap the side of his glass, and make the following toast: &amp;quot;Ladies and gentlemen, ghosts and goblins, witches and warlocks&amp;hellip;.here's wishing everyone an enchanting evening, an extraordinary experience, a marvelous masquerade, and, of course, a very, very haunting Halloween!&amp;quot; He and his wife, Adeline, would then sip from each other's champagne glass. A charming tradition&amp;hellip;..perhaps&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;but unfortunately, this year, his party agenda had been &amp;quot;fatally&amp;quot; altered. It seems just after Adrian completed his toast, and the champagne was flowing&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;there was murder in the air. &amp;hellip;. and double trouble, you might say.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tell us more&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone was holding their glasses high, listening to Adrian's words, watching the two enjoy the first of their bubbly, when suddenly&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;and in the blink of an eye, there were two &amp;quot;bodies&amp;quot; lying on the floor. How did this happen? How were they murdered?  Who could have done this?&amp;hellip;..and Why? A furious Adrian looked about the room, studied each face and with his glass still in hand he wailed, &amp;quot;Murder! Murder&amp;hellip;.right here in my home&amp;hellip;.and surrounded by friends and family!  &amp;hellip;.how could this have happened? I will not rest until I find the evil one who dared invade my home!  YOU&amp;hellip;.you are still here in this room, I can feel it&amp;hellip;.. and with the help of my friends, we will search you out, expose you&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;and of this&amp;hellip;.I solemnly swear!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, now it's time to join the fun and get ready to solve this mysterious &amp;quot;double-murder&amp;quot; at the Halabasters' Haunting Halloween!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
