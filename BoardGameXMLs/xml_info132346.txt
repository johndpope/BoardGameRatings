							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game of Bull</name>
									
			<description>Very simple game that is total luck. Four or more can play. Divide up the available counters equally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player chooses a design on the board, puts one counter on it, and spins the spinner. If it stops on his chosen design, he takes back his counter. If it doesn't, the counter stays on the board and the next player chooses a different design and places a counter on it. He spins the spinner and if either of the two designs with a counter on is spun, he takes both counters. If not, then his counter stays and the next player puts a counter on a different design. Now three designs have counters on them. He spins the spinner and if any of the three designs is indicated, he takes all three counters. If not, then that is 'Bull' and the next player takes the three counters for himself. He then starts another round by placing a counter on a design of his choice, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player should run out of counters, the game ends and the player with the most counters, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
