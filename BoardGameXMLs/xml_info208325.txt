			<description>Tides of Fate is a nautical fantasy strategy game set in the world of Thes'lia. The game supports 2-6 players with faction vs faction and free for all variants. Strategize and coordinate with allies to defeat the opposing faction by battling ships, conquering islands and sieging capitals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game revolves around five major mechanics. Movement, resources, expansion, combat, and fate. These mechanics allow for numerous different strategies while offering enough probability and luck to keep players on the edge of their seat throughout the whole game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is split between two factions, the Congregant and the Derelict. The Congregant are the Avarie, Lokar, and Naerath nations. They believe in a prophecy foretold by ancient priests that the gods would return and bring harmony back to the people and Thes&amp;rsquo;lia. The Derelict are the Rogand, Kondrei, and Vayunne nations. They believe the era of gods have come to an end and wish to bring Thes&amp;rsquo;lia into a new era of revolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These conflicting ideologies have brought much strife between the two factions. The Hallowed Isles have become the only reliable origin for resources, causing the land and oceans surrounding them to become theaters of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
