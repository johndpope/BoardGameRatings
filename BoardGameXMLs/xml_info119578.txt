			<description>Spodd is a two player game with a twist for the Shibumi game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment: the 4x4 Shibumi board, balls in two colors. The board is rotated 45 degrees to have clearly seven columns with varying number of balls (1-3-5-7-5-3-1 on the surface of the Shibumi pyramid).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules: the board starts with two red balls placed in the left and right corner holes. Two players, White and Black, take turns placing one ball of each color adjacent to each other. The balls can be placed on board holes or on top of 2x2 platforms of existing balls. You can place a ball on a hole and the other on a platform, as long as they touch each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim: without the left and right corner holes there are five columns with an odd number of balls on the pyramid surface (3-5-7-5-3). When the pyramid is complete, the player with the most visible balls in a column wins that column. The winner is the player who has won at least 3 columns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variant for expert players: players score one point when they have conquered a column composed by three balls, two points for a five balls column and three points for the seven balls column. The winner is the player with the highest score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: the game has an odd number of columns composed by an odd number of balls. Ties are not possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the Shibumi Rule Book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soft cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-andres/shibumi-rule-book/paperback/product-18940123.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-a...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Downloadable PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
