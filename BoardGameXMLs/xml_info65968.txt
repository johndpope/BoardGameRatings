							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Roland Garros</name>
									
			<description>French game themed on the famous Roland Garros tennis tournament. The game consists of a board where the players move their pawns and six 18 piece puzzles (that form a tennis racket), one puzzle for each player. When the player's pawn lands on a space with the same color they can take a puzzle piece from the stock. If they land on a different color they have to take a trivia card and if they answer the question correctly they may also take a puzzle piece. When they land with their pawn on an exchange space they have to exchange one of their puzzle pieces with an opponents piece. The player who finishes his puzzle first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
