			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PC version runs in Windows, but also includes a Microsoft Windows Runtime system for PCs with only MS-DOS or Tandy DOS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Back of the Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been more than forty years since the first nuclear bomb exploded. In that time, the shape of the world has changed dramatically. The power to destroy civilization rests in the hands of the superpowers and now, as either the President of the U. S. or as the General Secretary of the U.S.S.R., you have total responsibility for your nation's course. To succeed, you must enhance your country's prestige without infringing too much on your adversary's interests. If you play the isolationist, you will find yourself alone in a world dominated by your opponent. If you are too aggressive, you could unleash the war that annihilates humankind - and both sides lose.&lt;br/&gt;Balance of Power uses a huge statistical database, a meticulously detailed display of the world, and advanced artificial intelligence techniques to put you in command of one of the world's superpowers. You have vast amounts of information available as you press your country's interests and resist the pressure of the other side. Noted game designer Chris Crawford has created a model of the world which will entertain, educate, challenge, and perhaps frighten you in ways no computer game has ever done before. &lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Covers the eight years from 1986 to 1994&lt;br/&gt;     Advanced database allows an accurate portrayal of the world and its politics&lt;br/&gt;     Advanced artificial intelligence routines create a versatile and varied computer opponent&lt;br/&gt;     Includes four increasingly challenging levels of play&lt;br/&gt;     Offers one- or two-player games&lt;br/&gt;     Includes world maps that illustrate Resources, Well-Being, Violence, Political Rights, Civil Rights, Major Events, Insurgencies, Diplomatic Relations, Treaties, Spheres of Influence, and more&lt;br/&gt;     Helps develop an intuitive understanding of the forces that shape our world&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
