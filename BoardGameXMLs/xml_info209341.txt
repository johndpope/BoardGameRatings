			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I Am Jungle King, and This is MY Domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sacred Lands are a realm of prehistoric adventure, closely tied to Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behold the unique, human and non-human denizens:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Alraune: These floral humanoids evolved from carnivorous plants.&lt;br/&gt;    Humans: Numerous human tribes descending from humans who accidentally stumbled into the prehistoric dimension.&lt;br/&gt;    Saurians: The greatest threat to the human inhabitants of the Sacred Lands are the Saurians; a race of evolved dinosaurs.&lt;br/&gt;    Zebrar: This race of equine humanoid evolved from African zebras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then there are a few notable individuals as well:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Stenops (PL 11): a saurian scientist, who believes that by merging saurians and humans, he will create a new race of super-beings that will dominate the Sacred Lands.&lt;br/&gt;    Jungle King (PL 8): Protector of the Sacred Lands. A human born to travelers who ended up in the Sacred Lands by accident. Raised in the energies of the Life Matrix, he is stronger, faster, and more resilient that typical humans. &lt;br/&gt;    Nemean (PL 8): Jungle King's powerful, and faithful saber-toothed cat companion.&lt;br/&gt;    Powerstar (PL 10): An Earth-born meta who seeks to protect and defend the newly discovered lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, the Sacred Lands also has its share of enemies ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
