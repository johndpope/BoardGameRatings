							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BrewMaster: The Craft Beer Game</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher/designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players combine ingredient cards to produce six beer styles including ale, stout and Belgian. In doing so players use some of the 90 cards representing real beer ingredients.&lt;br/&gt; After producing beer players place chips (representing crowds) onto the laminated game board (so that it can be played on a bar table). As the game continues players try to make better beer and steal crowds from each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is heavily influenced by event cards, which are drawn after players brew beer. The event deck represents some of the real triumphs/tragedies that have taken place in the craft beer world, such as the brewer who loses his green scrubie in the heat exchanger and loses a turn. The event deck also contains beer festivals and the dreaded Big Breweries card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most beer festival trophies and crowd markers wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is good for game fans as well as experienced and novice beer lovers and their friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
