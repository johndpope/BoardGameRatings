			<description>This is a Mormon game which teaches about Mormon genealogy and their family sealing practices on a monopoly type board, with a separate board where one collects cards relating to family members, and then tries to collect other cards to unite those family members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From submitters' memory:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gameboard was a dark color, and composed of dark colors, but basic layout was like a monopoly board. At the corners it had side routes which you could choose to go on instead of the main route. These would have slightly longer detours around the corners. You would roll one die and advance that many spaces. On each space were opportunities to earn money, spend money, find ancestors and locate ancestors. If you found an ancestor, you obtained a blue (boys) or pink (girls) card representing that ancestor which you then put on your own board (which you had in front of you) which represented you and all your ancestors. The idea was to collect all these ancestors (such as brother, mother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, etc.) and put their cards in their respective portions of this board. Once you had them all, the next goal was to seal/unite them all together. You did this mainly on those side routes, which was where you could get sealing cards. You would put these cards (one per link between each ancestor) to connect the ancestors together. The first person to connect all their family/ancestors together won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
