							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Donelson Breakout</name>
									
			<description>Donelson Breakout covers the Confederate attempt to escape from Grant's siege of Fort Donelson. It uses the Age of Rifles system, for a fast, low to moderate complexity, brigade-level game of ACW battles. Interactive Sequence of play, orders, and a modern, fire-based combat system (no odds optimising!). To win, you have to use your army like a 19th century commander. Maintaining morale is the key. Running away will inspire defeatism in your troops just as heavy losses, but no side will emerge unscratched when encountering the enemy. Among all this you have to contend with multiple subordinates on a battlefield where no information can be sent faster than a rider can go. How you are able to orchestrate your leaders to enable effective concentration of force will decide the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system combines a grand tactical perspective (battle strategy, not micromanagement) with a focus on a historically sound use of your units. Four pages of basic rules aim at an easy entry into the world of pre-industiral command and combined arms with four types of orders and assault combat, cavalry charges, and artillery bombardment. Nine pages of full rules add concepts such as additional order types, written orders (although markers are available for those who do not wish to write), reaction charges, and enfilading fire. Finally, 2 pages of Advanced and Optional rules add hidden movement, division level doctrine, and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scale:&lt;br/&gt;400m per hex&lt;br/&gt;1 hour per turn&lt;br/&gt;brigade level units&lt;br/&gt;Individual army and division commanders&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
