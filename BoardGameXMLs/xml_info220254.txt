							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Blind Medusa</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Medusa is already a legendary creature in countless fantasy worlds, recognized for her petrifying gaze and terrifying hair of snakes. Many warriors will brave their lairs for fortune and glory, only to have their statuesque corpses left behind to mark the event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In one such lair, a young fighter used his wits to avoid the Medusa&amp;rsquo;s direct gaze with a reflective shield, thinking it would protect him. (It did not.) There was however, an unintended side effect: the Medusa became caught in its own gaze. Her face was permanently scarred by petrifying stone, blinding her and rendering her sight useless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the months that followed, starving and alone, she called upon her gods to give her new abilities which would let her survive and praise their names. Her request was granted, increasing her powers exponentially. Now her cracked eyes are the last thing many heroes see before they become a permanent fixture of her dark lair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is only one certain way to escape the Blind Medusa's wrath: Put out your torches, close your eyes, and sneak out of her home before she finds you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
