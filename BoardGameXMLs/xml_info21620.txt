			<description>This game is similar to BINGO with the following differences:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- each board is made up of combinations of 5 shapes (circle, rectangle, triangle, square &amp;amp; hexagon) and the numbers 1-10.&lt;br/&gt;- there are 2 spinners which each player in turn spins both to obtain a shape/number combination to match to their board.&lt;br/&gt;- each player has their own turn and do not share the combos obtained on their spins with the other players.&lt;br/&gt;- if the shape/number combo isn't present or has already been filled on their board, that player may choose to re-spin one of the 2 spinners for a chance to get a combo that they do need.&lt;br/&gt;- like in BINGO, the first player to complete a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row of 5 wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is great for Ages 4 - 10 for teaching number and shape recognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
