			<description>CALCUL is the 1st boardgame credited to Rudi Hoffmann.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's like most of his games one with easy to understand and to learn rules but including the special &amp;quot;Kick&amp;quot;: Every player starts with two parts of a pyramid cut in half, and following a certain pattern on the gameboard tilting their pieces, they have to reunite these halves to form a complete pyramid on one the the square board fields.&lt;br/&gt;The more players the more challenge, as the space to tilt your pyramid is limited...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was a special promotional item for a company doing promotion itself, and it was of immensly high production quality: The game box was a wooden one, the gameboard was printed on top of it and the the pyramid halves were made of wood covered with lacquered cardboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
