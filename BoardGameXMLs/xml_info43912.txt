			<description>Two players or two teams are playing against each other in this game. They movement of their playing pieces is determined by dice rolls. &lt;br/&gt;Each player has a fort in which he or she puts prisoners (i.e. other player's pieces that were reached at the end of a move). These prisoners have to be guarded by a playing piece of the own color, but can be freed if the guard is defeated. The player or team who conquers both of the other team's forts, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
