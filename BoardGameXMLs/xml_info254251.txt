			<description>A bunch of cards have all kinds of different sheep on them. On your turn you draw one card at random from the player to your right and then play as many sheep cards as you want, telling a story to connect them as you go along. Then the other players vote on whether the story made sense or not; if at least half say yes, you can just discard the cards, otherwise you have to draw to replace them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to get rid of all your cards. However, the game continues until one team wins. The only catch is, nobody knows what team they're on until they run out of cards! Cards that tell you what team you're on are dealt at the start of the game but are kept face-down and unchecked until you run out of cards. This keeps voting honest even as the game goes on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the rules are in Japanese, the cards have no text, so the game can be played in any language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
