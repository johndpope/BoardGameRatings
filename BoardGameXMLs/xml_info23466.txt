			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funetically Correct the board game that lets you spell it like you hear it.  Funetically Correct is a game of innocent creativity and flexibility. The game challenges its participants to spell words the way they sound. Players use letters, numbers and a few assorted icons to spell words or phrases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played by as few as 2 people or as many as multiple teams. Because the game relies on others being able to identify your word or phrase, the game changes every time you play. Enjoy the experience. Challenge your imagination with this fun, creative game. Recommended for ages 7 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
