			<description>Dragons like Knights, and Knights like Dragons... With ketchup!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 players face off, one as the Dragon, and one as the Knight.&lt;br/&gt;Winner of 2 out of 3 battles between 3 (or 4) unique match-ups of a Dragon and a Knight.  Is it the Plate armored Knight vs the Hatchling Dragon, or the peasant wearing Quilted armor vs the Ancient Dragon?  You won't know until you flip your Armor Cards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 4 levels of protection (Armor) as well as Effort cards and Weapon Cards.  &lt;br/&gt;The Knight can attack with a [Mighty] and [Good] Effort with his [Razor Sharp] [Halberd] for 11 points, or if his hand is full of weak cards, he'll be forced to make a [Pitiful] Effort to attack with his [Crossbow] for 2 points.&lt;br/&gt;What to play, what to hang on to?  Deceptively simple, with a deeper strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever defeats their opponent by reducing their Health to zero in combat will have dinner when they're done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
