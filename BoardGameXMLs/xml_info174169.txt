							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Geek Army</name>
									
			<description>It is time to bring together your own Geek Army and take over the world (game night) in this 2 - 5 player, simple and fun card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of us were picked on at school, many were last to be pick for sports and many want to take over the world. Well the fight back starts here! Some will fall in the upcoming battle, but if you bring together the ultimate Geek Army, you will take over the world (game night). Come the GEEK REVOLUTION!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has been designed to be played at a game night or convention. Your job is to build the best geek army you can. Each player starts with a hand of cards. On your turn you must do the following actions in order. Draw or Pick Back, then Place and finally Discard. Do each action only once then play passes to player to your left. This continues until a player &amp;ldquo;Goes Out&amp;rdquo; by having no cards in there hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game calculate your score by adding the value of each set in your army together (the cards face up in front of you).&lt;br/&gt;Then minus the value of any sets you have left in your hand. Each of the 10 sets of Geek Cards, have a value based on the number of them you have collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The large number indicates how many points in total a set of this type of Geek is worth. The twist is that each set does not necessarily become worth more with the more of that type you have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who wins the game gets to use their new geek powers (meta game effects like picking who makes drinks, or what game the group plays next.) You might want to play again just so you don't have to make the drinks for the rest of the event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
