							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Times in Brighton</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Times in Brighton is an adventure for four to six characters of 1st - 2nd level. Although designed as a Labyrinth LordTM compatible product, It is easily compatible with most fantasy RPG systems. In addition to the adventure itself, contained within these pages are details of Brighton and its people, a town that could easily become an important part of your character's careers as adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town of Brighton exists in the north, at the source of the Daakencraags where the Darkenwolde Forest shades the winding Brother&amp;rsquo;s River. The legendary adventurer, Richan Thatcher (along with his party of adventurers) carved the place away from a once mighty goblin kingdom. It has prospered for many long decades, until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Townsfolk are disappearing from the surrounding countryside. Goblins are on the march once more. If that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, a terrible blighting disease has infected the waters and not even the curative magics of the Temple of the Winds can thwart it. This is indeed a very dark time for Brighton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
