			<description>&amp;quot;Game Boy Wars 3, the third and final Game Boy Wars sequel produced by Hudson, was released on August 30, 2001 exclusively for the Game Boy Color. The working title during the game's development was Game Boy Wars Pocket Tactics during development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay of Game Boy Wars 3 is a departure from the previous Game Boy Wars titles, being modeled after the Nectaris series of war simulators that were also produced by Hudson. For example, indirect attack units can now move and attack at the same time in one turn. In contrast to the previous Game Boy Wars titles, having the required fund is not enough to produce certain units. The player must provide construction materials to the factories and cities as well. To do that, the player must deploy construction units to these sites and built the materials. These construction units can be used to cut down trees and create roads.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Game_Boy_Wars,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
