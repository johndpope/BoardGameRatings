							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Canticle of Smoke</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Location: across the Flame Worlds&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The secretive and subversive arm of Unity, the Canticle of Smoke is an unknown quantity to even those relatively high up in the Fire Council. Smoke operates outside the remit of the other armed forces of Unity, and performs covert missions such as infiltration, assassination and all manner of other high risk actions. The rulers of Smoke aren&amp;rsquo;t known, and the agenda of the organisation seems more complex than even the other canticles of Unity realise. One thing about Smoke has become clear to the Envoy &amp;ndash; its name is known to the organisation, and its agents are targets of Smoke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By its nature Exilium is a mission-based roleplaying game, with separate missions being generally unconnected except by the presence of a Shadow. This can lead to a very &amp;lsquo;episodic&amp;rsquo; feel to games. Smoke is a key organisation in this regard as it allows the Narrator to introduce elements to games sessions which transcend the mission structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that the mission shard is system neutral so could be used for other science fiction roleplaying games, although some of the factions etc. are context specific for Exilium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
