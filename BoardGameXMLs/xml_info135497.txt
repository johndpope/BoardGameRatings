			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Quiet down you two.  We aren&amp;rsquo;t supposed to be this close to the exclusion zone.  If an ETM patrol finds us we lose a month&amp;rsquo;s worth of salvage.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dodger was right of course.  The Martian government and Eckard Tactical Management took security around the Cydonia Ruins very seriously.  All manner of alien artifacts had been discovered along the edge of the exclusion zone ranging from what most believed were extraterrestrial chew toys to massive egg-shaped devices thought to be long dead fusion power plants.  While Dodger and his crew had so far only found shards and pieces, a single intact artifact could make them all very rich...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gift of the Makers is an adventure for Traveller. Set in the in our own solar system, both on Mars and Venus, it involves a hunt for two enigmatic alien boxes, dug out of the ruins of the Cydonian city on Mars. Of course these boxes are valuable, and lots of other interested parties want them too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a TL 9 Traveller adventure for Zozer Games&amp;rsquo;  Orbital setting, it would be helpful to have that PDF, but it&amp;rsquo;s certainly not necessary and only the Traveller Main Book is required.  This adventure as written is intended to be an introduction and prequel to the Orbital setting and takes place three years before the official date of that setting (2100 AD).  However, this needn&amp;rsquo;t be the case and with minor modifications the Gift of the Makers could easily be integrated into an ongoing Orbital campaign, the Third Imperium setting or even 2300AD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Locations include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Cydonia - the city on the edge of the alien ruins&lt;br/&gt;     Bouncy House - the floating Venus aerostat&lt;br/&gt;     SUSS Prometheus - the personal spacecraft of an eccentric billionaire&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extras include: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New Vehicles&lt;br/&gt;     New Weapons&lt;br/&gt;     New Equipment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
