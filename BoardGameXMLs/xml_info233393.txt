			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;失われた宝玉 (Lost Gemma) (ロストゲムマ on the card backs) is a member of the &amp;quot;Lost Legacy&amp;quot; games family, but builds on the base formula.  Players are trying to locate the &amp;quot;Lost Gemma&amp;quot; (Latin for &amp;quot;jewel&amp;quot;) which is hidden among the growing ruins.  The game consists primarily of two phases:  Investigation and Search.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Investigation Phase, players decide whether to place their starting point card or draw and play something from their hand.  The former action can only be carried out once, while the latter forms the bulk of the phase.  With a few exceptions, cards played are added to the 5 x 5 grid that forms the ruins.  When players can no longer complete either of the main actions, play moves onto the Search Phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are hot on the trail of the &amp;quot;Lost Gemma&amp;quot; during the Search Phase.  The player holding the card with the lowest search value goes first and then turns continue in ascending value order.  Each player begins at their starting point card, chooses a direction, and then follows the path until they either locate the &amp;quot;Lost Gemma&amp;quot; or face failure (via a &amp;quot;Dead End&amp;quot; or by leaving the ruins).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to uncover the &amp;quot;Lost Gemma&amp;quot; wins.  However, if all searches end in failure, the game ends in a draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published for the Tokyo Game Market Autumn 2015 show, and features the characters from the Game Market catalogue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
