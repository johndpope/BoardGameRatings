			<description>This game by Technical Term Game Company of Japan comes packaged with Iron Lady's Fleet 2, a remake of the company's 2007 game on the Falklands war. Like others in the series (including Antarctic Fleet and 4th Fleet), it is based on the Victory Games Fleet System of tactical and operational naval warfare, using individual named naval ships, airplane squadrons, and smaller coastal patrol combatants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game deals with potential naval conflict between Ecuador and an allied Colombia and Peru. As a result, it has only a single sheet of counters, and splits an Antarctic Fleet-size map in half, with ILF2 on the other half.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
