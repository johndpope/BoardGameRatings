			<description>Pro Evolution Soccer (also known as World Soccer: Winning Eleven 5 in Japan and North America) is the first installment of Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer football video game series that was released on October 30, 2001 in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player animations (compared to previous versions such as ISS2 Pro Evolution) have been improved. The stadiums and crowds have been reworked for added realism. Some components such as flares, stadium shadows and multi-tired stadiums made their first appearances in the series.  The game includes FIFPro licenses for 53 National teams and 32 Club teams; including unlicensed names for six hidden teams and 33 hidden players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goalkeepers are much smarter, actually saving headers on occasion and not letting in quite as many howlers as past iterations in the series. In terms of shooting and passing, little seems to have changed. Lobbed shots can still be performed by either double-tapping shoot or pressing L1 in conjunction with the shoot button. Players run even more intelligently off the ball than before, and the ball itself seems to react more unpredictably than ever&amp;mdash;rolling through players' legs, ricocheting off defenders, and even occasionally bouncing favorably (some would say luckily) for a player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring is no simple affair, requiring equal doses of strategy, planning, and skill. Charging blindly toward an opponent's goal area will usually result in the player being dispossessed. Intelligent passing, individual skill, and a little touch of magic are the ingredients for success, making the act of scoring a truly enjoyable moment instead of a routine formality. Blasting a 30-yard strike home is just as satisfying as a well-worked play, as are the many other methods of scoring, be they skilful runs through the midfield or fortunate deflections off a defender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pro Evolution Soccer&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
