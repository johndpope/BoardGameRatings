			<description>From the front of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to volume two of the Bestiary of the Realms. As this is our second volume, you'll find several score new or converted monsters, as well as a few different interpretations of monsters that have already been converted.&lt;br/&gt;A word of caution, just as many official 3E and 3.5E monsters did not slavishly follow earlier write-ups of those monsters, neither do the monsters herein. Instead, we did our best to consider all sources, hopefully make full and creative use of the 3.5E rules (including non-core WotC books), and in many cases add a little bit here and there to many of the monsters, even if it was in only adding or updating their Realms lore. A few have even been renamed. One last note, we've done our best to include source references for all things where appropriate, except those found in the three core rulebooks or Expanded Psionics Handbook.&lt;br/&gt;Until then, Sword High!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
