			<description>The game consists of a deck of 54 cards. On each card is a different dog breed, belonging to one of 10 different groups and one of 22 different subgroups. Each player gets five cards from the start. Each round you get to ask one player for a certain cards that you need to complete a subgroup. If the other player has the card, you get it and can ask for another card. If the other player doesn't have the requested card, you have to take a card from the draw pile and it's the next player's turn. When you have a complete subgroup, you put it on the table. When the deck runs out, you count the score. You get points for all cards from a complete subgroup, and a bonus if you have two or more subgroups within the same group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
