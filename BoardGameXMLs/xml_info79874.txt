			<description>Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What happens before your character becomes first level? There are a whole lot of skills learned and yet when you multiclass you don't get that burst of skills again. So why are all those skills dedicated to your first level's class? Why can't they go toward some other profession your character had?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now they can. Is your Ranger a former Blacksmith? Now your skills can reflect that former training. Create richer backgrounds for your character because now you can put the skill points into skill unrelated to the class you take at 1st level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And, while you are creating these pre-first level characters, I just know you want to try a really low-level adventure. What is it like when the small hamlet's completely wet-behind-the-ears youth must face a lone orc? Rules for adventuring before level one are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Give it a try!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
