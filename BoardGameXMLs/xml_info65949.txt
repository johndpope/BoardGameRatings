							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Loto Tirelire</name>
									
			<description>French game published in the 1970's. It featured a set of 96 cards, tokens and a board with two rows with slots for 4 cards. The cards are divided in different theme sets (animals, celebrities, folklore, sports &amp;amp; work).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How the game works: each player receive a set of cards and each round they can either take a card from the player on their right or play a card in to one of the slots. If they can play a correct card on a slot space they may insert a token in a 'tirelire' (a little plastic box that represents a safe, every player has one). After every round the safe (which has numbers ranging from 10 to 1) moves one number down. The moment the safes are on number zero the game ends. The players open the safe and count the number of tokens in it; the player with the most tokens wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
