			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Night of Nights is a romantic short story in jeepform about a love that was never meant to be. It is a simple take on a classic tale, with just enough twists and turns not to make it into Pretty Woman. It is about creating the most beautiful tale with the given premises, about role-playing and about character and story immersion, for some definition of immersion. In the Danish short story scenario tradition (that may just be a figment of my imagination), the game is meant to be played in less than 60 minutes, including player preparation. There will be touching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players:&lt;br/&gt;2 players, 1 game master&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duration:&lt;br/&gt;About 1 hour&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Premier:&lt;br/&gt;Fastaval, 2008&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
