			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the year 20XX. Despite the actions of the malfunctioning robots from the future the singularity has happened. It is now the first days of the war between humans and machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the center of the war is one robot, it was unleashed with one mission then something went wrong and now it has several. This could be a good thing as there's no way it can fail them all... right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This item presents some variant rules to allow a competitive, three-player game without a game master.  Although not authored by the game's creators, it did receive their sanction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
