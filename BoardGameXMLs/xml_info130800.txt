			<description>A-Mart &amp;ndash; subtitled Arithmetic Mart &amp;ndash; has you shopping for food in the supermarket, but your goal is not to grab all the food that you can, but rather to remember how much food you actually bought. Oh, and you're a porcupine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players start at the entrance of the supermarket. On a turn, you roll the die, move that many spaces on the track, then take 1-2 food items from the shelves next to you on the movement track. Supermarket employees help you take more goods (so helpful!), while porcupine bullies force you to toss an item previously placed in your cart. Land on another player and you take something from them, potentially messing up both your counts. Some food cards &amp;ndash; being coupons, I suppose &amp;ndash; subtract from your total; others double the total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever reaches the end of the track first collects five bonus points, and the game ends. Players then announce the total amount of goods they've collected. If correct, they add 20 points to their score; if they're off, they lose 10-50 points depending on how far they're off the mark. Whoever then has the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
