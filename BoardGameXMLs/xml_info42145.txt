			<description>25 tiles with paths on them are placed face-down on the game board. Each player starts his or her dog's movement in one of the corners. The players then take turns flipping over an adjacent card and moving their dogs according to the path that is shown. When a dog meets another dog, the tiles are reshuffled and a new round is started. There is no strategy, it is a purely luck based game for smaller children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
