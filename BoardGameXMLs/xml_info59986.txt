							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dweomercraft: Lich</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ly everyone hates liches - those Lords of Sorrow - more so even than vampires, dragons and demons. They taint everything they see and are sentient, free-willed open wounds in the fabric of the omniverse. They are possibly the grandest form of blasphemy known to exist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Lord of Sorrow that rarely, if ever, leaves its crypt is not as frightening as one that frequently goes hunting for souls to eat. A lich that rarely, if ever, looks up from its magical work is not as useful to a game master as one that wants to collect the heads of the player characters as horrible conversation pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, here liches are given reasons to get up, go out and be horrible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this book is to expose a Lord of Sorrow on many levels: its magic, its mind, its goals, so forth and so on. In so doing, liches should become a more flexible tool in the hands of the game master, and the player character may become better prepared to deal with them - and players may even run a lich.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
