			<description>Installment 4 in the Legends of Time and Space&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the module:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Growing up on the periphery is not easy.  It's a tough life, and to survive, to have to know how to deal with ruffians, swindlers and thieves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For excitement, and to pay the rent, you make your living as a bounty-hunter.  The risks are great but the payoff can be tremendous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your quarry this time is a dangerous pirate, armed and ruthless.  Initially, his ventures were an irritation to the locals.  But as his greed and daring grew, he garnered the watchful eye of the meagerly-equipped local authorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to capture &amp;quot;The Duke&amp;quot; and bring him to justice.  But you must hurry.  The provisional government is weak, and with each of &amp;quot;The Duke&amp;quot;'s raids, society falls further into chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must find &amp;quot;The Duke&amp;quot; and neutralize him before it is too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This easy-to-play adventure is designed for solitaire or group play, and is suitable for one to four players, ages 12 and up. This complete game includes the adventure booklet, rules, pieces and game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player creates one or more characters from the rules, equips them with items they purchase and sends them adventuring by using a paragraph reference system, much like the &amp;quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&amp;quot; type of game. The player resolves encounters with die rolls and updates his character's status to reflect damage, victories, records key words, and attempts to complete the mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Counters and a map provided with the module, aid in visualizing the relation between character(s) and encounters with animals, bandits, stray robots, drunken gods and what have you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This series is strongly inspired by Metagaming's Microquest series: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/24145&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/24145&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
