							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">One Summer at Soundsend</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is early June 1932, and the big cities of the East Coast are rapidly emptying as the affluent flock to resorts in various states. One popular resort is the area of St. Jean's Sound on the coast of Maine, a little known area where many wealthy families maintain regular summer retreats in the three small towns, St. Jean, Soundsend, and French Head. Each town is distinguished by the origins of its summer residents. St. Jean is preferred by Philadelphians, Sounds-end by Bostonians, and French Head by New Yorkers. In addition to the many summer houses there are many rental cottages and several summer hotels. The main attractions of the area are boating on the sound, one of the few natural fjords on the East Coast of North America, and mountain climbing on the small mountains around the sound. The whole area is undeveloped, and the year-round population is small made up mostly of lobstermen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
