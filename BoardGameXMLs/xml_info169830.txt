							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sorcerers of Ur-Turuk</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sun, sand and Magic! This new D6 system-based RPG plunges you into a world of dark sorcery and burning skies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RPG has many inspirations from history, literature and RPGs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take a strong dash of persian mythology and desert culture. Add in some Sword and Sorcery excursions into the desert, ancient temples and dark gods. Finish with group-style play (where every player has multiple characters), a freeform and flexible magic system and a rules set based on the classic and proven D6 system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central characters are Sorcerers in an ancient and corrupt city, living together with loyal supporters and employees. The Sorcerers must find and explore ancient ruins in the deep desert to recover ancient lore, for this is the only way new magics can be discovered. The use of multiple characters means that each player can use the best character for each particular mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the manuscript has already been written, and indeed one chapter has already been laid out. Both this and the plain text pdf manuscript written will be made available to backers immediately. The manuscript should be complete by the time the campaign finishes with more layout hopefully done by then.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will feature multiple original pieces of art by the renowned artist Brian Macey and the whole book will be in colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Fast and action-oriented rules&lt;br/&gt;     Varied and specific character creation&lt;br/&gt;     Freeform magic system&lt;br/&gt;     Group-style play&lt;br/&gt;     Faction relationship rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
