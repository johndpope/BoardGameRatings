			<description>Mathematic think and logic game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets the same set of numbers (1 and 2 digits). He shuffles them and takes new that he has again 12 numbers on his hand each round. The player adds 3 stones to his Hand if he cannot do anything on his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board shows places for the numbers and the 4 base calculations between them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally there are rows of number fields, where the player can place series of numbers with always the same difference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On players turn he can place whole valid calculation, or a part of a series of 3 or more numbers (with the same difference).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A third possibility is to continue a series. The actual player places as much as he can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If something is wrong, he gets the numbers back and the next player has his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after the round when the first player has placed all his numbers. The player without Stones wins. If more than 1 has finished the one with the less number of used special marked field wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
