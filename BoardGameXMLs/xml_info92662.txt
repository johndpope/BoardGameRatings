			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jack of All Sides is a d20 adventure, playing in the world of the Iron Kingdoms designed for three to four characters of levels 2-4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 7th isn&amp;rsquo;t what you would call &amp;lsquo;Cygnar&amp;rsquo;s Finest&amp;rsquo;. Much of their ill-fated reputation was brought to them by Captain Gerald Custler. Although Captain Custler was a smart and educated man, he behaved quite jumpy in the field, ordering often disastrous manoeuvres and getting many loyal Cygnarans killed.&lt;br/&gt;A week ago, during a border skirmish with Khadoran troops, he led his men into an awkward position where they got caught between friendly and enemy fire.&lt;br/&gt;Much of the 7th was slaughtered that day...&lt;br/&gt;What remains of the division has been sent to the second line of defence for a much needed rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
