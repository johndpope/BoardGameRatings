			<description>In playing this Game, a teetotum of eight sides is made use of, together with six counters of different colours, as markers, to avoid confusion in telling the game. Each player should also be provided with about two dozen of counters, on which a nominal value should be set, that any player who happens to be out, may purchase of the winners. If more than six persons sit down to play, a greater number of markers may be cut out of card, and distinguished by figures, as may be agreed on.&lt;br/&gt;Each player proceeds in the game according to the numbers he spins, and pays the fine, or receives the reward appointed. Advances are made by adding the figure turned to that on which the marker stands. Should any player spin a number on which there is already a marker, he must take its place and the other must move one forward. Any player taking more than his due, must go back as many numbers as he took. If he take too few, and the next player have spun, he must remain where he was.&lt;br/&gt;Whatever fines are marked in the list of numbers, must be put into the pool, and the first who makes exactly 150, or `The Jubilee' wins the game; but if he happens to spin above that number, he must go back as may from 150 as he spun beyond it, till he or some one else wins the pool and its contents. Persons going backward in the game are exempted from the fines attached to the figures on which they be obliged to rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;George IV sits at the centre of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published May 1st, 1820.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
