							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Femme Fatale</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OMNI-Labs keeps its database of known meta-powered individuals in the middle of the Nevada desert, buried beneath a heavily fortified structure that has more in common with a military base than the research lab that's advertised at its front gate. The information in the database is the most complete and up to date data possible for the powers and background of every super-human known to mankind and alien species alike. Accessed by super-heroes, law enforcement personnel, international governments and even the occasional super-villain, OMNI provides a reliable resource for establishing who you're facing, how their powers work, and what they appear to be after.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Femme Fatale details five new super-villains for your M&amp;amp;M campaign, from the deadly Amazon X to the psychic radical Soulfire. They are wanted for a variety of misdeeds, from professional data-theft to waging a one-woman war against the super-human individuals that populate the 21st century, but they all have one thing in common - they?re among the most dangerous women ever stored on OMNI's records.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
