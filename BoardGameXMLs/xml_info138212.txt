							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Talisman of Gorshan</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Talisman of Gorshan is a FREE browser-based adventure for d20/v3.5 and includes a dice generator and links to the d20 System Reference Documents. Play from any internet connection. No need for dice or books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for 4-5 characters level 8-10&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Talisman of Gorshan the adventurers will seek out and return the 3 fragments of a powerful artifact once held by the mage, Gorshan. The talisman was broken by an orc&amp;rsquo;s blow in the battle for Broadarrow Crossing years ago, and the fragments carried away by the horde.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gorshan has managed to locate the fragments through remote viewing and needs the party to retrieve them. The adventure will take them to the high mountain nests of the Dragonhawks to the chilling grounds of Rakor&amp;rsquo;s Tomb and the desolate fields of the Forsaken Farms. These locations are all found in a small wilderness region known as Danarr.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure begins in Helmwood, a trading hub and home of a burgeoning lumber industry in the southern area of Danarr. The mage Gorshan has traveled here in order to be nearer to the last fragment to decipher its exact location. The party will be staying in Helmwood at the Dizzy Dryad Inn when they are approached by Gorshan&amp;rsquo;s men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
