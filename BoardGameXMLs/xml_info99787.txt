			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even the dullest heroes who see a big, hairy, monster with eyes of flame, scythe-like claws, and fangs the size of steak knives instinctively say, &amp;quot;Hey, that is probably something bad &amp;mdash; where is my gun?&amp;quot; Whether it lurks in their closets, squats beneath their beds, or even chases them around the world, there is never a question that what they face is a monster. As soon as the heroes sense its presence, out come the silvertipped bullets, holy water, and spell books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the most dangerous monsters are those that masquerade as something innocuous. They know the weaknesses of our flesh, the frailty of our spirits, and take advantage of these failings to get up close and personal. These monsters slide into the character&amp;rsquo;s lives, and possibly even their souls, to strike when the heroes are most vulnerable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following are three creatures that prey on human beings. Each uses a different form of disguise to infiltrate society and fulfill its need to feed itself and its young, propagate its species, or destroy those who oppose the Shadow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
