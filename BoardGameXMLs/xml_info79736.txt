			<description>From the game inlay card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The totally evil Terry Ball has captured your spherical pals:- Lover Ball, Eddy Ball, Glow Ball and No Ball.  Armed with only a bubble gun, you must enter Terry Ball's domain and struggle through the sixteen defence zones.  You will find a pal to rescue at the end of every fourth defence zone.  Each zone will offer a constant barrage of obstacles - glowing ones are electrified and will electrocute your ball on contact.  Terry Ball has also populated these zones with such nasties as doughnuts, microwave ovens and roulette wheels which are harmless when they first appear but become highly dangerous when they stop flashing.  However, do not despair, for as you negotiate these deadly zones, POWER DISCS will be created.  If your ball picks one up, he will receive either a piece of weaponry or a bonus of some kind.  Weaponry is shown as a series of icons to the right of the screen.  These are TURBO BOOST, HORIZONTAL LASER, SMART MISSILE, BULLET SPRAY (Front and Rear Bubble Gun), ELECTRO SHIELD, LASER SPRAY (Left and Right Lasers), MOLECULE BOMB (Nullifies Electrical Obstacles), SUPER BRAKES, LASER COOLING UNIT, RAINBOW RIPPLE LASER.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you start the game a POWER DISC will instantly appear on the screen.  Pick this up for a TURBO BOOST.  Now progress upwards through the first zone.  If you let you bubble gun fire for too long then it will overheat and you will have to wait for it to cool down.  Every time you die, you will lose a piece of weaponry.  As you progress through the levels, some faulty FAULTY DISCS will start to appear. These discs make movement even harder.  Finally on the twenty-seventh POWER DISC, you will get the ultimate weapon - PICK IT UP FOR RAINBOW RIPPLE LASER.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
