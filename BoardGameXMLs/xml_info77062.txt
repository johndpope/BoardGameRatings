			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glider PRO is the culmination of the Glider series of games, released on the pre-OSX macintosh platform.  It was originally published by Casady &amp;amp; Greene, and made available for free download by the author (John Calhoun) after C&amp;amp;G shut down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Glider PRO, the player controls a paper airplane, maneuvering it through a level called a House.  The hazards are everything you would expect to find indoors: tables, counters, stereos, TVs, fans, and of course the floor.  As a paper plane, you are dependent on the carefully placed heat vents in the floor (as well as a few candles) to give you lift.  This means you can only move laterally, and will glide downwards unless above a vent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are other enemies as well, such as popping toasters, jumping fish, dripping water, shredders, balloons, and enemy papercraft.  Your glider isn't defenseless either, as you can arm yourself with rubber bands, batteries, helium, and aluminum foil power-ups.  The goal is to make it past these obstacles and find the stars hidden around the level to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version introduced more elements to the game, most notably a level editor for users to import custom graphics and create their own houses.  By playing one of them, your glider can venture to an ocean liner, a space station, a castle, or simply outdoors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The charming graphics, nonviolent lighthearted gameplay, and great customization have made Glider  PRO surprisingly long-lived.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
