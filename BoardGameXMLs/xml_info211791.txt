			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under The Cowl is a short role-playing game for 2-4 players in the tradition of experimental tabletop RPGs and theater improv games. Players play retired characters who were superheroes, villains, and sidekicks who are being interviewed on a documentary-styled TV show focused on the rise and fall of super-powered humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed as a zero-prep, GM-less game, using the technology of the phone or tablet to replace physical cards. Digital cards include countless combinations of story prompts to lead you on your story as you recall your hey-days of being a super-hero ( or super villain ).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distributed as an Android-compatible &amp;quot;app&amp;quot;; requires all players have a device and the app.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
