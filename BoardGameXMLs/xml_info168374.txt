			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no easy way to describe this game.  You play a Fuzzball.  You are trying to collect key cards to go through elevators to the next level.  You want to eat junk food, as it gives you health back.  You want to collect rings, potions, armor, shields, and wands as power-ups.  You want to avoid the evil creatures lurking on each map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most importantly, you don't want to trap yourself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The levels are made up of patterns of tiles.  There is only a certain number of times you can go across each tile before it disappears.  Food and power-up items are hidden under tiles, while wands appear randomly in place of tiles during the game.  When an item is taken, that tile immediately disappears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So the trick is to find the elevator key card, and make it to the elevator without trapping yourself - but the more tiles you removed the higher your score.  And let's not forget about the creatures chasing you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game did come with a two-player mode, which involves both players using the same keyboard and playing against each other at the same time.  This was unique because it would alternate who played the Fuzzball, and who played the evil creatures.  Each time the Fuzzball would die, the players would swap who controlled good and evil.  Given how awkward that was, the game was usually played as a single-player game against the computer AI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
