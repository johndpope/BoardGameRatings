			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Simply Classes: The Foodamancer&amp;quot; is part of the &amp;quot;Simply Classes&amp;quot; series which offers a brand new d20 fantasy character class with an extensive history, player options, and ideas on how to fit it into any campaign setting. For untold centuries, the hearth and dining table has been the center of society. Food has long been celebrated as one of the most beautiful things in the world, held in high esteem by many different peoples and cultures. It is one of the few things that the many diverse peoples of the multiverse have in common: all creatures must eat to survive, whether it is raw meat or the finest in cheese potatoes. There exists those individuals who go beyond normal chefs; they are able to create the perfect dish, cast molten muffins at their enemies, and becoming the masters of their kitchen domains. They are the foodamancers: the Captains of the Culinary, Kings of the Kitchen, and the Princesses of the Pantry!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
