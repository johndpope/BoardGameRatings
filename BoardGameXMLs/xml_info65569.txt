							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Geometric Gin</name>
									
			<description>The players will be able to calculate perimeter and area of triangles, squares, rectangles, and trapezoids. They will also be able to categorize triangles by determining whether they are right, isosceles, acute, or obtuse. In the affective domain, the players will enjoy applying their geometric skills in a fun and exciting game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to get 'Gin'. This entails getting a correct combination of three and four cards. As in Gin, the cards must be categorized by 'suit'. The suits for this game are perimeter, area, or triangles. The cards must first be shuffled and seven cards should be dealt to each player. The deck should then be placed face down with one card placed face up as a discard pile. The play goes in a clockwise direction and begins with the player to the left of the dealear. At each players turn, the player has the option to pick the face up card or one from the deck. The player must then discard one card in the discard (face up) pile. Play continues until someone gets 'Gin'. When a player gets 'Gin', he or she must show the cards to the other players and explain what the two groupings of the cards are. The groupings may be of similar triangles, same area, or same perimeter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;48 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
