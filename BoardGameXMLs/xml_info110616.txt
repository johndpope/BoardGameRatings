			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike its SNES counterpart, which was a fighting game, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers game on Sega Genesis was a fighting game.  The player chooses between one of the five original Power Rangers and fights a one-on-one battle against Rita Repulsa's latest monster.  Victory in the one-on-one results in a battle between Megazord and a giant version of that same monster.  After a certain point in the game when you have defeated the Green Ranger and his Dragonzord, you have the option of playing as the Green Ranger and his Dragonzord.  Each Power Ranger has some standard fighting game moves and a couple of special moves.  Both zords have different moves and all of the monsters in the game have different moves that they will throw at the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
