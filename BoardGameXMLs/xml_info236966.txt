			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They said it was impossible to build a bridge across the Guthe Gorge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The King of Azadmere would never approve, but he was convinced. The site was too remote, but caravans and workers were organized. The wilderness was too dangerous, so mercenaries were hired and a fortified camp built. Then people started to believe it could be done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That was until the killings started inside the camp. In three days, three men are dead: two stabbed, one thrown into the gorge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now everything is coming apart. Someone, or something, is determined to drive off those building the bridge. The workers are terrified and on the verge of mutiny. They demand that something be done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can the PCs find the killer before they strike again? You must act quickly. The entire mission teeters On The Edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
