			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've been marooned on Bounty Island, home of the most sinister corporation on earth:  Omicron.  The Omicron Masters have discovered the secrets of mind control and genetic mutation- and they're about to take over the world.  It's up to you to stop them- but how will you do it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I you decide to search the Omicron vaults for secret datea, turn to page 98.  If you decide to hunt down the Omicron leader instead, turn to page 103.  Beware!  The Omicron Masters re fiends.  If they catch you, you could be devoured by mutant rats or frozen in a vat of liquid helium.  Or you might find a way to destroy Omicron- and save the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What happens next in the story?  It all depends on the choices YOU make.  How does the story end?  Only YOU can find out!  And the best part is that you can keep reading and rereading until you've had not one, but many incredibly daring experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
