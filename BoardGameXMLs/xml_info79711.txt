			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;A puzzle  game developed specifically for use with the Super Famicom Mouse. &lt;br/&gt;Wario is up to hi old tricks again and has dropped buckets on the heads of Mario and his friends. You play as Wanda the fairy whose job it is to guide Mario, Yoshi and Princess Peach to safety as they stumble about blind. You must make sure they avoid obstacles and enemies, fill in missing special blocks and reach the goal in a set time limit in order to clear a level. Each of the three characters has slightly different attributes and represent a step up in difficulty. Peach walks the slowest, then Mario, with Yoshi being the fastest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
