			<description>Domina is a traversal game by noted New Zealand game and puzzle designer Karl Scherer. The object is to get one of your pieces to the opposite end of the board before your opponent does the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is an 8x8 square grid, and the pieces are rectangles in two colors, seven for each player, each spanning two square spaces. Dominos in two colors on a standard Checker board work well. On a turn, a player pins one end of any of his/her pieces, then rotates it 90&amp;deg; clockwise. If, and only if, that would cause the rotating end of the piece to occupy a space that is either already filled, off the board or behind the pivot end of the piece, continue rotating the piece another 90&amp;deg; to 180&amp;deg;. Likewise, continue rotating another 90&amp;deg; to 270&amp;deg; if the next target space is unavailable or illegal. If none of the three target spaces make a legal move, the player must select a different piece to move. The first to land one end of a piece on the opposite row wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
