			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Covens of Chaos, the ninth in our line of monster books called Mythic Menagerie! Each volume in this line presents a small set of monsters tied to a single theme, but spread over a range of CRs. For Covens of Chaos that theme is variants of hags, the classic crone&amp;mdash;witch of fables and ancient mythology. As an added bonus, author Sam Hing has put together an awesome set of hag-related magic items, spells, and feats to round out your wicked wise women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hags are prevalent in many old fables, and are often portrayed as hideous witches who may or may not be human. From the witch who wanted to eat Hansel and Gretel or the tales of Baba Yaga in her flying mortar to the Greek and Norse depictions of the three Moirai (or Fates or Norns), powerful, ugly women of power are common antagonists in many of the stories from which modern fantasy roleplayng games draw inspiration. The very term &amp;quot;hag&amp;quot; evolved from the Old English word h&amp;aelig;gtesse, a word for &amp;quot;witch&amp;quot; that is also the root of the Germanic hexe, the origin of the hex powers of the witch character class. Much like witches, hags have a broad range of powers and a bad reputation, though unlike many witches, the hags' reputation is almost entirely deserved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While numerous types of hags already exist in the pages of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary, this product expands their options (and CR range) to ensure there's always a hag appropriate for any adventure. Within these pages you will find everything from hags that just wish to fill their bellies to those dedicated to destroying the powerful servants of the outer plains. From the disgusting and cowardly whaitiri (CR 3) to the terrifyingly destructive kalaratri (CR 15), the Covens of Chaos are ready and able to plot against player characters of any evel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So put some more wood around the cauldron, take a big bite of that shiny apple, and tell the children to be home before nightfall. The gwrachods are looking for new trophies, the night filches have their hair woven into nets, and the truies are hungry. The Covens of Chaos are plotting, and you're not going to like what they have planned!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
