							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Feats of Spellcasting</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb (from introduction):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Genius Games is proud to present our first Genius Guide to feats, Feats of Spellcasting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New feats for spellcasters should mean more than new metamagic feats. Just as monks, fighters and rogues can use feats to adjust and modify their fighting styles; bards, clerics, druids, sorcerers and wizards should have a range of options that let them adapt their spellcasting ability. Spellcasters may wish to focus on learning new ways to use their elemental spells (such as with Caustic Hex), increase just one aspect of their spellcasting power (perhaps with Far Caster), or master a new kind of magic that only works after the caster&amp;rsquo;s blood has been spilled (with Blood Mage). While there are a few feats a non-spellcaster could qualify for and find useful (such as Arcane Defense and Sensitive), the focus of this product is giving spellcasters just as many ways to differentiate themselves from every other spellslinger as a rogue has to become different from common cutpurses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
