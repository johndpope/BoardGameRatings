			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Math Blaster was the first game in a series of educational titles released by Davidson &amp;amp; Associates Inc. . The game was designed to teach children math, and provided an entertaining interface that led to its success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players control a small astronaut named Blasternaut and answer math problems by choosing which cannon to launch. A problem is displayed at the top of the screen, and each cannon contains a possible answer. Launching the correct answer will earn points. Both the overall game and each question are timed, and an editor is included for people to customize the problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Math Blaster covers addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and fractions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
