							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Adventurers&#039; Cauldron</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legends have it that on some far off plane, in a nearby dimension, there sits a large cauldron of bubbling magic. Since history remembers, wizards and lords from many worlds have sought after this cauldron, knowing that magical foods of unique ans bizarre powers are occasionally given forth from it's boiling depths. I recently decided to travel the many universes and gather up a sample of each food that the cauldron had given out to various adventurers. Taking these samples, I proceeded to experiment until I could reproduce these magical wonders. After years of trial and error, I finally completed my studies and decided to put the results in a form usable by everyone. The Adventurers' Cauldron is the result of my labors and I'm sure that each and every one of you will enjoy the normal adventure meal a lot more, when you don't now what's going to happen afterwards!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bon Appetit!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Terrestrial Warlock&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: All the foods and recipes in his book are fictional and are NOT intended for real-life use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
