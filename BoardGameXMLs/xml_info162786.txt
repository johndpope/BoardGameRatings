As the game progresses, space hexes are explored, flipped face up that is and planets discovered my be colonized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players earn Victory Points for controlling planets (1 VP per planet they control) as well as for having the greatest total population on all their planets, the most powerful military, the  highest research rate, the strongest fleet of spaceships and for having the largest territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each round, Victory Points are calculated and the player who is first to reach 12 - 20 VP is declared the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
