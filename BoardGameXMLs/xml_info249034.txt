							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fate of the Ruthless Wizard</name>
									
			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The old tower looms over your small village. In the past it was a sign of resilience, but now it has turned into something else. As you step out of your small homes into the Towers shadow, the fear of the wizard Broshgar creeps back into your hearts. He took your food and your goods, he abducted your friends and your family and without remorse he killed anyone trying to stop him. Only a few months ago he took four of your children at once. And you let it happen. But today is the last day you'll ever be afraid of him. Assembling in front of the towers entrance you are ready to end his reign of terror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
