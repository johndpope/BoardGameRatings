			<description>This is the improved 2nd Edition that will correct many of the discrepancies of the initial version. There is also an ERRATA sheet included to 'fix' this ONE as well. Illustrations are by J.M. Rea-Taylor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the Contents from the 120+ pages of this &amp;quot;tome&amp;quot;, including the inside Front &amp;amp; Back 'cover', then there are descriptions or annotations for:&lt;br/&gt;CONTENT&lt;br/&gt;Notes on Organization&lt;br/&gt;Notes on Equipment&lt;br/&gt;Notes on the Army List&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many charts included on these pages, to cover the weaponry that was available at the time that it is denoted for them here. Also, they've shown with diagrams that display the  components that would make up some of the more typical Unit compositions, such as a &amp;quot;Belgian MECH Brigade&amp;quot; and the like.  This even goes so far as to show the upper 'echelon' Units that would comprise the likes of a &amp;quot;Warsaw Pact Corps&amp;quot;, or the  Soviet &amp;quot;Group of Germany&amp;quot; forces. It even has an extensive 'Bibliography' that lists some &amp;quot;Wargames&amp;quot; and other books of *note* from which they culled their vast amount of '411' with regards to that all in it here. One additional *note* is that they intend for this to be used with the &amp;quot;Wargames Research Group&amp;quot; set of RULES, while it still doesn't detract or preclude from anyone using the information that they obtain within their pages, for just about whatever they are capable in doing with such.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
