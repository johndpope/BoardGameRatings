			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Ever since the world as we knew it ended, people have been saying that chivalry is dead - they've been saying it for a long time anyway, but this time they're sure. No one does anything for any motive except survival. Dog-eat-dog, survival of the fittest, might makes right... I've heard all those cliches and more. And I refuse to conform to them. Lieutenant Jimenez wanted me to take his St. Christopher's medal to his folks in L.A. No reward, no treasure at the end of the road. Just a favor to a friend, that's all. I promised I'd do it, and I will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City of Angels is a module for use with GDW's World War III role-playing game, Twilight:2000. Th adventure takes place near the blasted ruins of the Los Angeles area of Southern California. The story revolves around the obligation of one of the players to an old commanding officer. Living up to his promise thrusts him, along with his companions, into a journey through the hardest hit areas of the nuclear exchange of World War III. The group must contend with all the harsh realities of post-holocaust life, complicated by rival gangs warring over territories in what was once known as the City of Angels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information presented in this module includes source material and maps for the L.A. and Orange County areas, an overview of Southern California, and optional rules which include civilian character generation.&lt;br/&gt;City of Angels can be run on its own, or can be easily adapted to fit an existing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
