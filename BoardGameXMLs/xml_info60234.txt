							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rookie&#039;s Guide to Psi-Talent</name>
									
			<description>Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only a tiny fraction of the population within Mega-City One have any Psi-Talent at all. Through the power of their mind alone, these rare individuals are able to influence the thoughts of another, levitate inanimate objects or gaze into the future to witness their own fate and that of others.. Ever since the Atomic War of 2070, the incidence of psi-talent within the population of virtually every city in the world has steadily been increasing - as have the dangers associated with this unpredictable skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Justice Department of Mega-City One keeps an iron grip on the rise of citizens who possess psi-talent, or psykers, as they are known. Though psi-judges are a welcome and necessary addition to the forces of justice, the misuse of psi-talent has been responsible for some of the greatest tragedies ever to have befallen the city. The Judge Child Expedition, the Zombie War and Necropolis all have direct links with rogue psykers and psychic entities. Psi-Division therefore has many operatives who constantly scan the thought patterns of the entire population of the city, searching for those citizens who pose the greatest potential, danger. These individuals often join the ranks of the psi-judges if they are found at an early enough age, but many are sentenced to life in the psi-cubes - a harsh and drastic measure that destroys their freedom but ultimately protects every other citizen in the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside You Will Find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Psi-Flux: Learn all there is to know about the energy from which all psykers draw their powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specialists: Become a specialist in psi-talent and concentrate your powers into Dimensionalism, Pre-Cognition, Pyrokinesis, Telekinesis or Telepathy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psi-Powers: Over 90 new psi-powers are fully detailed in this supplement, greatly expanding the Judge Dredd Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Feats: Enhance your psi-talent yet further with the likes of Hypnopathy, Transformation and Longevity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summoning: Full rules are included for summoning the most vile and yet powerful psychic entities to the real world. Have a care though, for most hate mortals with a vengeance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lords of the Flux: For the first time, prestige classes for psi-talented characters are presented, including the Exorcist Judge, Psychic Master, Faith Healer, Snake Head, Trans-Dime and many more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experiments &amp;amp; Equipment: Get to grips with psi-talent, using a bewildering array of high tech devices, including the lethal Psi-Amplifier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Feats: Enhance your psi-talent yet further with the likes of Hypnopathy, Transformation and Longevity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
