							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pop-In Scoring Game</name>
									
			<description>Action game of skill.&lt;br/&gt;The board comprises of a three dimensional area with holes in it. The object is to get your marble-like balls into those holes. The balls are launched by a catapult-like device. You put a ball into this device and press down. When you let go, the ball is thrown into the air and, hopefully, into one of the holes. If it does, it rolls down into the scoring area at the bottom of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play for a set number of turns each or for a pre-determined time. The one with the most points, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
