			<description>Each player represents a football (soccer) club and moves a token up and down a short track, signing pro players and drawing event cards. When two players meet on the track going in opposite directions they face off in a match, the outcome of which is determined through rolling dice based on the players signed to each club. Some matches also trigger betting. Victory points are accumulated by winning or drawing matches, and the game is played to a number of points agreed on beforehand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
