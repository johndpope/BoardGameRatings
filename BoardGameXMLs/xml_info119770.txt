							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Exhibit: Artifacts of the Ages</name>
									
			<description>An old, eccentric archeologist has died and his private collection, rich with a variety of artifacts of various types from various Cultures and Eras, is being auctioned off. These artifacts have not yet been assessed, but as a museum curator, you don't want to wait for that - you do your own research and armed with partial information, you bid based on what you think the item's value might be. Once all bids are in, the artifacts will be assessed, and any bid that's higher than the actual value will not be approved by your board of directors! So for each artifact, the highest bid that is not greater than the actual value will win the auction!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exhibit is a set collection game with an unusual auction mechanism which is akin to multiple simultaneous games of Liar's Dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
