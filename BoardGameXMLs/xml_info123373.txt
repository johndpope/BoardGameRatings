							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DWARFâ€¢KNUCKLE</name>
									
			<description>This is a game about dwarfs knocking each other into pits and collecting gold. Dwarfs are natural fighters, and this game naturally contains a lot of fighting. It also contains forest elves to kick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns moving their dwarfs around the board and use item cards to trip up the other dwarfs. Depending on what game mode is in play GOLD could be waiting at the end of a race, ready to be dug up, or even in the hands of a GNOME IN A MECHANIZED POWER SUIT. It's up to the players to use their dwarfs special skills to out maneuver the competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
