							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Office</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Running a zombie apocalypse role playing campaign? Need a ready to go location, complete with detailed zombies and possible loot for the player characters to find? Then grab your stuff and start rolling!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie Attack Zone: The Office is a zombie infested location that&amp;rsquo;s perfect for a group of new or inexperienced player characters. There are quite a few zombies to be found in the abandoned office building as well as some basic survival gear for the heroic survivors to recover. The location is that of a basic office, with the exact nature of the business in question being left out to allow the Game Master (GM) to make use of the location any way that they see fit. Whether the heroes have stumbled into a law office or an investment firm, this location will work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
