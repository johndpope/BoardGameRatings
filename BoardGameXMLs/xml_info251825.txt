			<description>&amp;ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen, I have asked each of you in this room for a purpose. It is with grave urgency, and top secrecy that I request your time, your assistance, and your loyalty. I ask that you save our nation, and in turn save my life&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; The President&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the brink of civil war, The President of Karmonia has been given seven letters from an assassin, each marked with a day. It has been made clear that if the President does not meet each of the assassin&amp;rsquo;s demands, there will be dire consequences resulting in the death of The President.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seven letters. Seven threats. Seven days to die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patriot is a semi-cooperative board game of social deception, betrayal, strategy and teamwork for 3 to 6 players. Each player is dealt a secret card outlining their allegiance to The President &amp;ndash; save, or assassinate. Through the midst of this, the country of Karmonia is in turmoil. It is up to you and your team to find the assassin whilst maintaining the country through a number of difficult missions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However...! If you are the assassin, it is your mission to sabotage, betray and secretly maneuver the game in your favour, resulting in the assassination of The President and the destruction of Karmonia. Just don't get caught.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
