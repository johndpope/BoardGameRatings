			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wolverton rests on the rocky shores of the far-flung Lonely Coast. The mighty fortress Caer Syllan keeps a protective eye over its harbour which hosts ships from all over the world coming to trade for the precious metals and gems pulled from the nearby mines. A muddy, noisy place, Wolverton is home to hardy frontier folk eking a living from the earth while contending with half-goblin tribes, packs of shadow wolves and other monsters dwelling in the nearby Tangled Woods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the town serves as Lord Locher&amp;rsquo;s seat and the capital of the Lonely Coast Wolverton&amp;rsquo;s muddy streets are far from safe. While regular patrols ward Wolverton and the surrounding villages from monstrous incursions, new threats rise to weaken the Lochers&amp;rsquo; iron-fisted grip. Merchants tired of high taxes and tariffs secretly plot ways to take power while in the streets smuggler gangs fight one another in a vicious turf war. Beyond these threats lurk even greater dangers. In a black stone tower, a vile necromancer plots his path to lichdom and the conquest of the Lonely Coast while a villainous monster secretly makes his home in the previously abandoned sea caves of Morveren&amp;rsquo;s Galley. Thus, brave adventurers will always find a welcome among the folk of Wolverton! Wolverton stands on the Lonely Coast, but is easily adapted to almost any GM&amp;rsquo;s home campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a Dual Format PDF.The downloadable ZIP file contains two versions, one optimised for printing and use on a normal computer and one optimised for use on a mobile device such as an iPad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
