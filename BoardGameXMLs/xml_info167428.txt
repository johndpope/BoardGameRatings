							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ingress: The Relic</name>
									
			<description>A turn-based board game for 2-6 players based on the video game Ingress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theme:&lt;br/&gt;In the middle of the 19th Century, a trade ship named Niantic departed Connecticut and set sail on a voyage to the Orient coast.  Some say the Niantic was smuggling Opium out of China and Indonesia but while that may have been a side deal worked out for its journey home, the merchant vessel Niantic docked in Whampoa Harbor and unloaded a precious cargo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A relic, uncovered during an archeological dig hundreds of years earlier, was transported to Whampoa Harbor and buried there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The relic laid buried in the area that later became known as Whampoa Garden until approximately 150 years later, when in 1999, Liu Fan excavated it and working in combination with a group of international researchers, went to work unlocking its secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ingress: The Relic casts up to six researchers in roles to unlock the undiscovered power of exotic matter.  Researchers take turns placing portal tiles on the relic board and activating them with resonator tokens.  Connecting three fully activated portal tiles can lead to an even greater power by creating a control field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;The game plays out on a grid-based board with tiles in a manner somewhat reminiscent of Go or Chinese Checkers.  Winners use a combination of action cards and tile placement to earn action points.  The player to first reach 50 action points or the player with the most action points at the end of 10 rounds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
