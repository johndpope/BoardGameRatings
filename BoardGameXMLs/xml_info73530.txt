			<description>POLYTAIRE is an expansion of -the ancient solo. game Solitaire and thus it is partly:&lt;br/&gt;a more richly varied game for one player and partly:&lt;br/&gt;a game for two players based on the same principles, but of such a nature that it can be played quite straightforwardly or so strategically that one thinks several moves in advance just as in chess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE POLYTAIRE BOARD&lt;br/&gt;is played on a board which like that of Solitaire has 37 squares or holes, but in contrast to Solitaire these are placed in a triangular pattern giving a hexagonal board.&lt;br/&gt;How was I to untie the knot and entice the balls` out into the open?&lt;br/&gt;The solution was quite simple: let the ` aim of the game be to remove as many as possible of one's own balls from the board - a principle which is far simpler and more logical and should be the more obvious solution as it is more closely related to the principle in Solitaire.&lt;br/&gt;It is worth mentioning how richly varied and free from boring interludes is the simple-game which hereby evolved when compared, for example, with Chinese Chequers, especially considering how much smaller area - 37 holes as against, 121.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[From the rulebook]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
