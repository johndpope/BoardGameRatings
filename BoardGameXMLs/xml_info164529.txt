							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Henchmen!</name>
									
			<description>This game reminds us how important henchmen are when it comes to attaching lasers to sharks and getting things done that we don&amp;rsquo;t want to get caught doing ourselves! Henchmen are the backbone of society but they&amp;rsquo;re never appreciated and are often killed, strangled, beat up, or even shot off of high ledges...and this game won't be any different!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 to 6 players will work with or against each other to earn as much ca$h as possible before the end of the game in order to please Da Boss but watch out, taking on a job could alert the Super Jerk who won't think twice to kill half of everyone's henchmen! If 5 Super Jerks are revealed, the game will end and the player with the most ca$h will be declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Henchmen! is a fun, easy to learn game that is fast paced and has great replay value. The art was all done by the game's designer Daniel Lanza and was styled to be a call-back to famous television shows and movies of the 80's and 90's that truly emphasized the henchmen stereotype we all grew up loving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hope you enjoy this truly unique game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
