							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shellback</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shellback is a story roleplaying game about the strange events surrounding the USS Enterprise (CVN-65) aircraft carrier, in the spring of 2006. For six days, the ship disappeared from every radar and surveillance known to man. No record exists of this event and the US Navy has redacted every document during the six-day period. True or not, on March 28, the Enterprise reappeared. All of the crew member&amp;rsquo;s records have been sealed and no reporter has ever been able to piece together the events of those days. No one. Until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players.&lt;br/&gt;The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
