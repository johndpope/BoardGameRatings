							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shakey&#039;s Libation</name>
									
			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to gain all the letters spelling LIBATION.  The first one to do so (or last one under the table) is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling the die and moving around the game board.  Players perform various actions when landing on a space (chug-a-lug-active player drinks, boomba-la-roomba-everyone drinks, chance-active player draws a card and performs *that* action).  Players also collect a letter of the word &amp;quot;libation&amp;quot; corresponding to the space landed on.  The corner squares are similar to monopoly (start, dungeon, throne room, go to dungeon).  Gameplay continues until one player successfully completes the word libation or until all other players are 'under the table'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
