			<description>A collection of four individual games, playable with the same materials:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Die Expertenkommission:&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a card with 0, one with 8 and one with 15 laid out in front of him/her. One player starts and rolls a die (numbered 2-7) and announces the result. The next player rolls the die and adds to or subtracts from the result (never going below 0 or above 15, so there is not always a choice). When a player reaches 0, 8 or 15, s/he can flip over the respective card. When a player calls a number of a card s/he already flipped over before, another player can say &amp;quot;thank you&amp;quot; and pick up a chip. A chip can be used to add or substract an additional point. The first player to flip over all three cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Der Budgetausschuss:&lt;br/&gt;Same as above, but any player can shout out the result. First player to shout 0, 8 or 15 and covers an additional card with his/her hand gets to turn the respective card over. &lt;br/&gt;A player who announces a 5 or 10 must flip a card back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- An der B&amp;ouml;rse:&lt;br/&gt;Same as Expertenkommission, but the number at the bottom of the die counts. First player to shout the correct new number and covers a special &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; chip, continues the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Der gro&amp;szlig;e Wurf: &lt;br/&gt;This is a cooperative game with a time limit (the rules suggest 15 minutes). The (numbered) cards are randomly laid out, some with the colored side up, some with the black/white side up. As above, players roll the die and add or substract numbers. When 0, 8 or 15 are reached, the active player can change the position of one corresponding card with another one. If the number is reached by using the number at the bottom of the die, the players may flip over two grey cards which are already in the correct position. &lt;br/&gt;A roll of 2 that cannot be used gives the players a lobby handicap (flipping over a colored card). A second handicap leads to flipping over two cards, etc. When four lobby chips are collected, the game is lost. With an unused 7, the players can collect ecology chips with which they can counter the lobby chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in Austria and tries to show finding unusual solutions. It was supported by the Austrian government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
