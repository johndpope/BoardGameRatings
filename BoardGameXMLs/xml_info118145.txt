			<description>designer summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drinking Quest is a Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery game like no other. It's a light RPG but a complex drinking game, perfect for an off kilter Game Night with the gang. You'll be slaying monsters and earning Experience Points but also downing your drink when you run out of Hit Points! Not a big drinker? That's okay, Drinking Quest is full of enough dry wit and internet memes to entertain even the most sober of guests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't like your card? Use the Headbutt to the Groin or Hell's Hangover card to lay the monster to waste.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time to chug your drink? Well you'll think twice before you rush into battle without proper Drinking Quest armour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You just killed a pack of wild Booze Hounds? Use the coins they inexplicably carried to buy a Bottle Opener Sword or a Keg Destroyer Axe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Failed a Saving Throw for Sexual Prowess? Turns out she was a zombie the whole time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Already played a game and want a new challenge? There are four unique characters each with their own set of strengths and weaknesses that lend to a new play style. Not to mention a randomized quest system that guarantees no two games will play out the same!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab some friends, a case of beer and enter the exciting, inebriated world of Drinking Quest!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
