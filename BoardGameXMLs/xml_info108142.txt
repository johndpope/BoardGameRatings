							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Neirya the Gun Goddess</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Her name is Neirya Blajeny.  She was born to parents who performed in a travelling carnival, and became a master marks-person by the time she was eight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was the day that her father died that she began fighting the Supernatural.  Aliens, demons, cyborgs... now it&amp;rsquo;s all a blur of one fight after the other.  That&amp;rsquo;s what happens, though, when you&amp;rsquo;re in the world of HOT CHICKS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the second in a series of Character Studies... detailed examinations of characters that occupy the back alleys and shadows of HOT CHICKS: The Roleplaying Game.  Included are over forty images of Neirya in various stages of dress, including none at all.  She may not have had a good relationship since... well, ever, but there&amp;rsquo;s always hope!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Read her history, study her form, and view her statistics.  She makes an ideal NPC companion, ally, and is also perfectly suitable as a Player Character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
