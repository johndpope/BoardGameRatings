			<description>Nexus (working title) is an abstract strategy game for two players in which you want to be the first to occupy the opponent's home blocks. The playfield is comprised of a series of three-dimensional blocks that can be re-configured to create paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start, the three red and three blue home blocks are placed on opposite sides of the game board with the corresponding pawns on top. Each player rolls a die to determine how many action points (APs) he can spend on his turn; the points can be divided between moving pawns and modifying the board. The possible actions are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Move (1 AP) &amp;mdash; Move a pawn to any orthogonal, unoccupied adjacent face if the path is unbroken. If a player lands on an opposing pawn, that pawn returns to one of its home cubes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Add Block (1 AP) &amp;mdash; Add a purple block to the board adjacent to one of your pawns. This block defines a path that all players must follow. Blocks can be stacked vertically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Rotate Block (2 AP) &amp;mdash; Rotate any unoccupied adjacent block; blocks below other blocks cannot be rotated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Remove Block (3 AP) &amp;mdash; Remove any unoccupied adjacent block from the board; blocks below other blocks may not be removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red and blue home blocks cannot be rotated, removed or stacked upon. The first player to move all three of his pawns to his opponent's home blocks wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
