			<description>The aim is to become Lord Mayor of the City of London. The game is played on a map of the City of London which is divided into 25 Wards and features a route through the City from Old Bailey to the Mansion House and beyond. 20 Wards contain 3 Ward Seats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players first gain Wards, using Ward Cards to gain a Seat Majority. They become elected to four Wards in succession using Election Cards and answering questions correctly.  As each Ward is won, players move up the ranks from Freeman, Councilman, Liveryman to Alderman. Now the aim is to become a Sheriff by travelling from Old Bailey to Guildhall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sheriffs then travel through the City on a route to the Mansion House that includes the Lord Mayor's Show procession. En route players answer questions and retain correctly answered cards which bear points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a Sheriff arrives at the Mansion House with 5 or more question cards they can become Lord Mayor at Guildhall. If no other Sheriifs are on the City route, the Lord Mayor wins outright. Otherwise the Lord Mayor travels from Guildhall towards Mansion House trying to remove the remaining Sheriffs before they reach the safety of their own Wards. A points tally of the top 5 cards determines whether or not the Lord Mayor beats the Sheriffs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
