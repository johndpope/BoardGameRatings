							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pokemon Rummy Card Game</name>
									
			<description>As a Pokemon themed version of rummy, the object of the game is to be the first player to earn 100 points by making matches and runs. The game features round pokeball-backed cards that are numbered and suited like traditional cards and can be used for other card games. It comes with rules for a Pokemon variant of Rummy in which runs are created with different evolution stages of Pokemon characters, aces are wild cards, and jokers allow you to take a card from another player's hand. These four joker cards feature characters from the first season of the Pokemon TV series: Ash, Misty, Brock, and Team Rocket and the represented Pokemon are all from the Kanto region: Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, Venusaur, Charmander, Charmeleon, Charizard, Squirtle, Wartortle, Blastoise, Pidgey, Pidgeotto, Pidgeot, Pikachu, Raichu, Ekans, Arbok, Clefairy, Clefable, Jigglypuff, Wigglytuff, Meowth, Persian, Koffing, and Weezing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
