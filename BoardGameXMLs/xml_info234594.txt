							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shaun het schaap: Pizzaspel</name>
									
			<description>Shaun the Sheep has returned in a co-operative children's game. &lt;br/&gt;The farmer ordered a delicious pizza but the naughty pigs surprised the delivery man and stole it from him! They almost ate the entire pizza and hid the leftovers slices in the bushes. Shaun and his friends have decided to find the leftover slices and share them equally together. However, the farmer has sent Bitzer to capture them, therefore the sheep have to be watchful!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;The game starts when a player has chosen to play as Bitzer, which results in the other players to play as a sheep. The sheep have to work together in order to find every single pizza slice while being careful for muddle pools, Bitzer's traps and Bitzer himself. They win the game when all pizza slices have been found before Bitzer captures them. If Bitzer captures the sheep first, then he'll win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
