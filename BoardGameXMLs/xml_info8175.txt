			<description>This is a set of 15 different cardboard discs depicting most of the bean types from the Bohnanza universe.  These sheets were sold for 0.10 Euro each at Spiel 2003 in Essen.  As of this writing, there are no published rules for the expansion, and the publishers are accepting suggestions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The discs depict beans from the German base game and revised expansion set (including an Ackerbohne), as well as the three beans unique to Al Cabohne.  Absentees include the two beans introduced in La Isla Bohnitâ (Wachsbohne and Mokkabohne) and the Cognacbohne from Amigo's revised edition of High Bohn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The missing Wachsbohne may be especially puzzling to owners of the Rio Grande Games base set: the German editions of the Bohnanza expansion set do not have 22 Wachsbohnen, but rather 22 Weinbrandbohnen.  This means no Wax Bean disc for you, so you'll probably want to use the staggering &amp;quot;brandy bean&amp;quot; disc as a proxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bohnanza counters are part of the Bohnanza family of games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
