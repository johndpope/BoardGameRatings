							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">If Looks Could Kill</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a level 6 party!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone in the villages that once made up the Kingdom of Lilies knows the tragic tale of Queen Niva Brysis, a fair and beautiful sovereign from a past generation. The queen and her kingdom are often thought of in the same regard; the kingdom didn&amp;rsquo;t truly come into being until her birth, blossomed in her youth, and wilted away as the queen aged and succumbed to madness. Of course, this is in the annals of history now, as Queen Niva died decades ago, crazed and alone in her mountain keep&amp;hellip; right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not according to a new cult calling itself The Queen&amp;rsquo;s Adherents. This group not only claims that Queen Niva is alive and well, but she has regained her youth and former beauty. What&amp;rsquo;s more, they promise any that join their ranks may receive their queen&amp;rsquo;s blessing and become immortal themselves! The PCs are ultimately the ones that need to dissolve the cult from growing, and in doing so look into the mystery behind the queen&amp;rsquo;s enigmatic return. But be careful, because if looks could kill, this mission could be murder!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
