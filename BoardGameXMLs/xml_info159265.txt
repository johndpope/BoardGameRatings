			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Off the Coast of Clover Island and less than a league away from FT11: Corsair Bay is the wreck of the Golden Rose a ship of fame. The Tome Lord from Corsair Bay is looking for a few brave adventurers to go out, find the ship or what remains of it and locate a specific item for him. While the mysterious sage won&amp;rsquo;t explain what the item is he will tell you that it is protected by mighty magical glyphs of protection so simply obtain the box and bring it to him for the reward. Rumor has it the ship was laden with a great deal of treasure which is free for the party&amp;rsquo;s taking but the Tome Lord wants the box. Is your party up for a little underwater jaunt?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for a mid-level to high level adventuring party.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
