			<description>Sovereign is a relatively simple deck-building war game with a great deal of player interaction. Each player takes on the role of a leader, hidden behind his castle walls. The goal is to amass an army and batter down your opponent's walls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All cards have two possible uses, most of which can either be a Simple Action, which is played then discarded, or a Unit, which remains in play until it is defeated in battle. Players generate gold to purchase more Contract cards and Influence to place their Units on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two main paths to victory: one may defeat his opponent on the field of battle, or create a great Monument. Monuments are built in three tiers, each giving a permanent bonus (depending on the Monument). The third tier ends the game in a victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
