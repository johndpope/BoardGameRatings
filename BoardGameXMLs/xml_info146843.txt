			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Duke of Crossed Gears, obsessed with the dreams of scientists and visionaries, is dead - but he left something behind. On his deathbed, the duke dreamed of a place, and such was the power of his spirit that these visions became manifest upon his dying breath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter Mechadia, a savage realm of Suzerain where idyllic Sylvan glades merge with mechanical wonders. Elven airship pirates hide away on floating islands; begoggled goblins run amok in steam-powered brass-and-steel contraptions; Brownie alchemists seek formulae for new ways to harness the pulse beyond the clouds. But Mechadia isn&amp;rsquo;t quite the paradise the duke dreamed of. The trolls have become restless as they toil to keep the great gears of the land turning smoothly. Fey lords and ladies vie for rulership over the fledgling realm, and lines are being drawn in the copper dust....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE FEY ARE GEARING UP FOR MISCHIEF. DO YOU HAVE THE BRASS TO JOIN THE GAME?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside the covers of this book you&amp;rsquo;ll find all new pulse paths, schools of magic for creating savage worlds characters in the fascinating realm of Mechadia, where steampunk meets faerie magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
