							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big Book of Kaiju Volume 4</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Big Book of Kaiju&amp;rdquo; is many things. It&amp;rsquo;s a collection of giant monsters culled from the annals of movie history. Any fan of the genre will be able to recognize a favorite monster here. It is also a game master aid for the &amp;ldquo;Mecha vs. Kaiju&amp;rdquo; game, powered by Fate Core, offering statblocks for adversaries to throw against players. And finally it is an aid to players of &amp;ldquo;Mecha vs. Kaiju,&amp;rdquo; giving them an insiders look at how citizens of Japan and the world view the creatures that daily menace their lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you play other Fate games it is unnecessary to have the Mecha vs Kaiju Core Book to use this supplement. Each kaiju is fully stated out with unique stunts and is usable in any Fate game. However, if you want your players to have a chance of beating any but the weakest version of these monsters, it's best to have a mecha at your side!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kaiju are not bound by the limits of nations. They soar though the skies, ignoring borders and making their nests where they will, whether the heart of the wild or in the skyscraper of a modern city. The Sora no Kaiju are fast, fierce, and free, and none moreso than Sanshuseki, the two-headed flying terror, detailed here in all its historical forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contais:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    4 new flying kaiju. Each kaiju is described as if written in the &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; Big Book of Kaiju, with commentary by contributors about their behavior, tactics, and biology. Each entry features detailed stat blocks, complete with rules for all stunts and mutations, at three power levels:&lt;br/&gt;        A level for starting Mecha vs Kaiju characters, or those who run MvK without Construction points. This power level is also appropriate for ANY Fate Core game.&lt;br/&gt;        A level for Experienced groups who have achieved Major Milestones.&lt;br/&gt;        An Endgame kaiju, in its final form, suitable for campaign finales or gamemaster tantrums.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    New statblocs for Sanshuseki, the multi-headed alien monster, enemy to all terrestrial kaiju.&lt;br/&gt;    New kaiju mutations, including numerous movement-based powers.&lt;br/&gt;    New rules for the P (Mertvaya Ruka), Russia&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Dead Hand&amp;rdquo; kaiju -- lobotomized and enslaved through cybernetic control systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
