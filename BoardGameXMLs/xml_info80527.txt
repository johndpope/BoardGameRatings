							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bison Run</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Children of the Apocalypse and Vegas Families are hosting their annual Bison-pulled hauler race from the Junkyard to Vegas. First place team wins 3000 steel coin and an all expense visit to Godiva&amp;rsquo;s. Teams that place second through fifth place also receive prices. The rules are simple; every hauler team consists of 4 to 6 people who choose camels or bison and a hauler base on a random draw from the entry pool. Does your team have what it takes to win the Bison Run? The Bison Run is an Exodus OPS campaign scenario for 4 to 6 characters of 1st to 3rd level and can easily be adapted to other post-apocalyptic settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario has been updated from the original to reflex the new Experience system used in the Exodus OPS campaign. OPS players that have already played this scenario, cannot re-play it, or gain any benefits from the changes within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
