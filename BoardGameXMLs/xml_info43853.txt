			<description>From the web:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;STORMBRINGER is a roleplaying game based on a series of novels written by British writer Michael Moorcock. In these tales he describes Elric, the albino Prince of an empire that ruled the Young Kingdoms for 10,000 years but has settled, into a long decline. Now new nations are on the rise in the Young Kingdoms, new heroes have come to the fore, and new stories wait to be told.&lt;br/&gt;This book includes everything you need to tell such 'heroic adventures: an introduction to the Young Kingdoms (the world of Elric); instructions and examples for character creation; how to run a STORMBRINGER game session; complete background information about the inhabitants and nations of the Young Kingdoms including dozens of earthly creatures and creatures of chaos (plus methods of creating your own creatures); game statistics for the major characters described in Moorcock's tales including Elric of Melnibone and Stormbringer, his powerful runesword; religions in the Young Kingdoms; many adventures ready to play.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; revised and expanded demon-creation rules&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; many new interior illustrations&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; eight full-color plates&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; updated character &amp;amp; demon sheets&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; five ready-to-play adventures&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; complete, revised rules&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This book is a complete RPG game published by Chaosium, detailing the world of Michael Moorcock's Elric saga. The players usually take the roles of human explorers in the Young Kingdoms, although other race information is provided. The Elemental Gods (so frequently invoked by Elric) are described and a system for magic spells is also given. The game was revised and republished under the title Elric! some years later, however many people I know consider Stormbringer a better work. Like other Chaosium-produced games (Ringworld, Elfquest, Runequest, and Call of Cthulhu) skills are done on a d100 system and stats usually range from 2d6 to 3d6+6, depending on racial packages. Thus, if you know one game, it is pretty easy to pick up another. Of course, there are some minor differences from system to system, so it is not a truly universal RP system. I did like this game and would recommend it to any Moorcock, Chaosium, or fantasy fan.&amp;quot; ...from Amazon reviewer &amp;quot;Derek Petrey&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
