			<description>Publisher Advertisement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;May, 1941&amp;mdash; The dreaded Nazi battleship, the Bismarck, has broken out of the North Sea and is now somewhere in the North Atlantic. Your mission is to make a nighttime photo reconnaissance flight over the Bismarck. These photos will help the Admiralty determine the extent of damage done to the Bismarck in a previous battle and whether the British fleet has a chance to sink the German pocket battleship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Night Flight program lets you take-off, fly, and land a propeller driven aircraft. You can practice approaches and landings with a full on-screen display of the landing field. Or you can go on a mission, follow the radar vectors to your target, and get your photo (hopefully returning safely to your airbase without being shot down).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program simulates the flight characteristics of a real aircraft with pilot input for all flight maneuvers. During the flight, you are supplied with a real-time stream of flight information, navigational aids, glide-slope markers, and landing field information. The instructions with this program can practically teach you to fly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Somewhere out on the cold, gray North Atlantic, the Bismarck tries to elude her pursuers. Your photos are vital. Launch yourself into the night sky with the Night Flight package.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
