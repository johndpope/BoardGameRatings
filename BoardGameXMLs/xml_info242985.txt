			<description>On these game each player choose sides controlling the characters of the Justice league or the villains.&lt;br/&gt;On every turn the players can do one of 5 different actions: move, attack, use a special card (usually a special attack), recover a life point or recovery a special card (both last two options only if you are in special positions in the board).&lt;br/&gt;To move you must roll a die the show how much spaces you can move. To perform an attack you also roll one of two dice (one for bigger attacks and one for smaller attacks) if your character is in range (each character has different ranges where he can perform attacks). After an attack, the defender can roll a defense die. If the attack and defense die show the same color, nothing happens. If both show different, the defender loose a life of the attack die (if the defender doesn&amp;rsquo;t have those life color he loose a red point or two life points.&lt;br/&gt;The team who survives wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
