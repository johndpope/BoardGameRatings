							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">Le tour de Gaule d&#039;Astérix</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Liberate Lutetia and the other Gaulish towns from the Roman cohorts.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Le tour de Gaule d'Ast&amp;eacute;rix is a simple roll the die and move game, in which players attempt to liberate towns as they move through Gaul.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of a round track superimposed on a map of Gaul. Lutetia and 19 other Gaulish towns are located at various spaces on the track. Each player starts with some money which they may use for equipping Gaulish armies. In turn, each player rolls the die and moves the indicated number of spaces along the circular track. If a player lands on an unliberated town, he or she may attempt to liberate it using their Gaulish armies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
