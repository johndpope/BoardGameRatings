							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kampfgruppe Vier</name>
									
			<description>By using the contents of this volume in conjunction with other 'Kampfgruppe' titles actions such as raids by commando or airborne units can be recreated from landing. Larger scenarios might involve amphibious landings in the Mediterranean or 'island hopping' in the Pacific. On a more routine level, the various sections of this volume can be employed to provide air and 'off table' artillery support during predominantly land actions. Similarly, come of the specialized combat engineering vehicles developed for the Normandy landings can be used to assist in overcoming difficulties further inland, as occurred in the actual conflict. In common with its companion titles, Kampfgurppe Vier is fully compatible with all other aspects of the'Kampfgruppe' system and can be employed fully, or in part, to suit the specific requirements of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
