							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bedlam (TRS-80)</name>
									
			<description>Instruction Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bedlam is another new adventure from Radio Shack. There are no hidden treasures to find, no wealth to amass, no score to beat. There is only one goal--get out, if you can. Your success depends totally upon your resourcefulness and your ability to think clearly. There is always one way out, but be warned--the exit changes each time you load the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To help you escape, you can try enlisting the aid of some of the people you meet. Just remember where you are. Can a man running around painting doors on walls and claiming to be Picasso really help? Can a man who says he is Houdini get you out? What about using &amp;quot;X-Ray&amp;quot; Johnson to burn a hole in the wall to gain freedom? Perhaps the guard dog just needs a little attention. Maybe the nurse or the doctor with the hypodermic needle (if he really is a doctor) can be persuaded to help you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their ability to help also changes each time you load the game. Depending on the active escape route, you will either be able to escape without help from anyone, or you will need help from one or more of the people you meet. Some of the inhabitants of Bedlam are neither friendly nor cooperative. They do not get along with other inmates and some will try to stop you from leaving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are times during the game when you might be in serious danger. One particular resident of Bedlam can create problems, which only a well-timed [PLUGH] can cure. You must choose your allies wisely from among the people you meet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good Luck. I really hope you make it. Who knows? You may even be lucky the first couple of times and get out easily. You may not be quite so lucky the next time you try.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
