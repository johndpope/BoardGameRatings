			<description>Issue game of Wargame Japanese History #26.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A card game where players take on the role of ninjas and attempt to complete various missions, ranging from assassinating targets to stealing teaware masterpieces from under the noses of their owners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn, each player must play a &amp;quot;Mission&amp;quot; card from their hand.  Players roll two dice and check that against the difficulty level of the mission (located in the top-right corner of the card).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a mission is successful and they survive, that mission and its accompanying amount of &amp;quot;legend points&amp;quot; are added to the player's career record. The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, other players may assist or interfere with the outcome of missions, so negotiation and strategizing are important aspects of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
