							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Duel Disk: Yusei Fudo Version</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second version of the Yusei Fudo Duel Disk had a number of adjustments made to it, addressing a few of the issues that made the previous Duel Disk impractical for gaming.&lt;br/&gt;The Deck Zone now holds 40 sleeved cards, whereas the previous version could not accommodate sleeved cards at all.  The Graveyard holds 30.&lt;br/&gt;A space for cards &amp;quot;Removed from Play&amp;quot; and an &amp;quot;Extra Deck Zone&amp;quot; was included, along with a bottom covering along the arm blade.  The flip action of the 2009 version was reversed, which follows the canonical Yu-Gi-Oh designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
