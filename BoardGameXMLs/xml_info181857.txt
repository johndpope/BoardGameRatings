							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Masters of Midnight: Drow Archetypes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get in Touch With Your Dark Side!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strange and exotic, beautiful and deadly, militant and aloof, the drow are a race that can't help but capture the imagination, and these dark elves have grown from a role similar to goblins and orcs to become a popular race for player character adventurers. Though they are perhaps too mysterious to find a home in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook, drow have carved out a place for themselves in the hearts and minds of gamers everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, when you choose to make your player character a drow, all that you really care about is the +2 bonus to your Dexterity and Charisma scores (and who needs Constitution, anyway?), so why bother playing a drow barbarian? Even if a +2 bonus doesn&amp;rsquo;t really make that much of a difference, it just feels so wrong to knowingly combine a race and class that don&amp;rsquo;t go well together, and, as a result, many players never bother to consider it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book aims to give players who want the fact that their character is a drow to matter more a way to make that happen, while also providing support for drow characters of a variety of classes that don&amp;rsquo;t typically make much mechanical sense for drow. Included are the arachnochemist, an alchemist that foregoes traditional mutagens in favor of a strange and unusual concoction that allows them to transform themselves into half-elf, half-spider monstrosities, the underdark barbarian, a barbarian archetype that focuses on speed and maneuverability, outwitting foes in the dark and calling upon inner reserves of strength to rage longer, the drow webstalker, a hunter archetype that grants a special giant spider animal companion that eventually grows to huge size and can spin powerful webs, the drow deathweaver, a warpriest archetype that uses Charisma for spellcasting, and grants access to the exotic spider blessing, and the drow housemage, a wizard archetype that can sacrifice other aspects of themselves in order to boost their Intelligence, and gain greater resistance to magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
