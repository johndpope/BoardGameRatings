			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whispering Pines is a tiny village hidden deep in the north woods, surrounded by a deep pine forest. It has always been a dark, isolated, and unwelcoming place. Now it is a nightmare for those who live here, a nightmare which threatens to spill out from this secluded enclave and engulf the entire world, because it has been taken over by the undead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whispering Pines includes the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A complete and detailed description of this tiny, haunted village and its environs&lt;br/&gt;    A map of Whispering Pines&lt;br/&gt;    Ten NPCs - friends, foes, and ordinary people who make Whispering Pines their home&lt;br/&gt;    Five short plot seeds&lt;br/&gt;    A full-length adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cities of Wonder is a line of books envisioned by Bill &amp;quot;teh ebil bunneh&amp;quot; Keyes, each describing a city, town, village, neighborhood, fortification, space station, caravanserai, or some other place that people live, play, and work.
