							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">54 Jones: Keeping up with the Joneses</name>
									
			<description>In 54 Jones the Baord Game, you play clones of sewer worker 54 Jones on a training day in the sewers of subterranean 12 Station City.  However, 54 Jones unleashes a tidal wave of 'shunk' to try and drown the competition.  The first clone to reach high ground wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To reach high ground, each junior Jones clone must race along the sewer network, battling his fellow clones, shirkers, Cynthia and the endless ever changing labyrinth of tunnels. Players get the chance to rotate, lock and change tiles throughout the game.  Only the most calculating and devious clone will win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is now available to buy from Rathbone Games and comes with boards, counters, dice and sewer denizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
