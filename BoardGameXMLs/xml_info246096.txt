							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sylvanhome</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wood elves of the village of Sylvanhome have lived in this corner of the forest undisturbed for as long as anyone can remember... until now. As it makes its way through the dense woods, the party comes upon a community locked in a subtle, but tense debate over its future. Humans have made their way into this sylvan paradise and the elves aren't sure what to make of them. The hunters who just want to pursue game might be friendly, but the gang of bandits are mean and dangerous. Will the elves choose war or peace against the newcomers? The party has the chance to influence Sylvanhome's future, one way or another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
