			<description>This expansion consists of 50 new cards and rules to supplement the original game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must still make advantageous marriages for your ladies and gentleman but now with the inconvenience of an undead apocalypse which threatens to make a bloody mess of your wedding plans. One player starts the game afflicted with the Curse of the Living Dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cursed player draws cards from the new deck - both on their own turn and when anyone gets married. This deck includes many Zombie cards, which transform the Cursed player's ladies and gentlemen into flesh-eating monsters! If the player runs out of characters to infect, they must pass the Curse onto someone else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gift cards send useful items to other players - including weapons and the means to protect themselves from zombie attacks. Event cards may unleash a horde of ravenous Zombies on polite society or help the poor survivors to persevere with their essential tea-drinking and courtship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is very difficult for the Cursed player to win, but not impossible - if they can keep their Zombies well-fed with a stocked up Slaughter pile...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
