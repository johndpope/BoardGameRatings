			<description>Publisher's Blurb&lt;br/&gt;Why Migraines?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We designed 14 Days with a focus on migraines because the subject matter is personal, and it&amp;rsquo;s one we can present with confidence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics of the game are based on the unpredictability of migraines and the medications, rebound headaches, and misconceptions. However, there are many types of chronic pain that impact and reshape people&amp;rsquo;s lives. We hope 14 days can serve as a resource for building empathy and understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;14 Days isn&amp;rsquo;t a game about describing pain. It&amp;rsquo;s a game about balancing the responsibilities of everyday life when you don&amp;rsquo;t know what tomorrow will bring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though 14 Days centers around migraines, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to know anything about migraines to play. Some folks who played and enjoyed the game include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     People who experience migraines or other chronic pain conditions&lt;br/&gt;     The friends and family members of people with chronic migraines&lt;br/&gt;     People interested in a deeper look at the day-to-day impact of chronic pain&lt;br/&gt;     Folks who enjoy tabletop games!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
