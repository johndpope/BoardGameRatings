			<description>Hack-away is a roll and move game based on taking a pony on a hack through the country, with players sometimes having to answer questions about horses and horsemanship to avoid missing a turn or being sent back down the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are shortcut bridleways that can be used, but these are riskier routes and may mean the player goes back to the start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the game only comes with 4 pawns, there's no reason to stop 5 or more people playing the game, if you have different tokens for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
