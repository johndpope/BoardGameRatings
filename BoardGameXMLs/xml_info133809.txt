			<description>The game contains a two-piece 'staircase' with a total of 12 steps representing Mount Everest, 4 'jumper' playing pieces and 3 dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim is conquer Everest, i.e., to climb to the top of the stairs once and then climb down again. The first player to succeed in doing this wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives a playing piece and places it at the foot of the stairs. The younger player begins and game follows clockwise with all players trying to climb the stairs 1 to 12 and then to descend from 12 to 1 using the numbers on the three dice. The following rules apply:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     All three dice must be thrown for every turn&lt;br/&gt;     The playing piece can only be moved forward if the number of the next step is contained in the sum of any combination of the dice&lt;br/&gt;     If the combination allows, more than one step may be climbed in a single move&lt;br/&gt;     On the descent, the exact numbers must be thrown, e.g., if the piece is on the third to last step, a 2 and a 1 must be thrown to reach home&lt;br/&gt;     The first player to reach the summit may throw again&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
