			<description>The Union de la Sommellerie Fran&amp;ccedil;aise (French Union of Sommeliers) created this wine-trivia as a relation gift. The nice wooden box contains a map of France, 6 bottle-meeples, 1 die and 8 sets of 44 cards. On each card, you find 3 questions on wine (in general or questions about a wine region).&lt;br/&gt;Players have to roll the die and answer a question. If the answer is correct, you can play again. If wrong, next players starts rolling the die.&lt;br/&gt;Winner is that player who comes first at the ending point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
