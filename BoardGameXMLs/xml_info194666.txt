							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Three Years of War</name>
									
			<description>War is upon you. As a minor noble on the outskirts of the Hundred Years War, the major houses have all but forgotten you. But your neighbouring rivals have not. Be wary lest your enemies&amp;mdash;-and the crushing despair of war&amp;mdash;-destroy you once and for all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three Years of War is a card-based hand and resource management game. Through cunning card play, players vie for precious resources while making the most out of desperate situations and increasingly bleak options. The player who best navigates this barren and bitter landscape, minimizing their setbacks along the way may just have what it takes to survive... three years of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
