			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;THERE IS ALWAYS MORE TO SEE. THE UNIVERSE HAS NO END... AND NEITHER DO I.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are legends about them on every planet, in every galaxy. They are timelss, ageless. They appear when great danger threatens, and then vanish just as quickly. Some revere them as gods, others fear them as demons. They call themselves the Immortals... and they may be the answer to your dreams, or the source of your nightmares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secrets of the Immortals brings a new kind of hero to your OGL d20 System games... a hero who rises again and again from the ashes of the ultimate defeat, reborn and remade, and ready to adventrue again into a new lifetime. Included are:&lt;br/&gt; *The Immortal Template: For characters who adventure across time and space, forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Pool of All: The place where mortals are transformed into Immortals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*Feats for Immortals&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Information on the Atlanteans, an ancient race whose civilization is built around the Immortals, and who travel the galaxies fightling evil wherever and whenever they find it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secrets of the Immortals is part of NUELOW Games's Modern Basics series for OLG d20 Modern, but it is usable in any game that uses the OGL d20 System. All that is required is that the game can be home to characters who like traveling around in vehicles that are bigger on the inside than on the outside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
