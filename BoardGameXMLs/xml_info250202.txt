							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Abandoned Parking Lot: Lot A</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The parking lots of the post apocalypse is littered with an assortment of abandoned vehicles. All of these hunks of metal are waiting for the characters to exploit, loot, and possibly even drive off in. Though the Game Master and the players might have a few ideas of what sort of vehicles they would love to find, the parking lots of the urban wastes are random with their offerings. Some cars and trucks are worthy finds, others are semi-useless hunks of crap. Some of the interior contents of these vehicles offer the characters much needed supplies and treasure while some contents lack in anything desirable. Just like the parking lots of our current times, you are never likely to know what you'll find until you snoop about a bit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
