							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">La Bataille d&#039;Halle 1806</name>
									
			<description>Some historical writings cast the war encounters between French and Prussian Troops in 1806 as &amp;ldquo;no contest&amp;rdquo;. These battles are often characterized as the modern system of skirmishers and columns against outdated linear tactics. However recent research has challenged this simplistic view in that Prussia had begun to modernize their infantry tactics and used skirmishers following their conflict with the Revolutionary French Armies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;La Bataille d&amp;rsquo; Halle is such a battle. The French Corps of Bernadotte attacks the Reserve Corps of the Duke of Wurttemberg. The Prussians are defending the Army&amp;rsquo;s line of communication which runs through an important crossing of the River Saale. The roads to both Leipzig and Magdeburg exit from this city and the main Prussian Army is retreating along one of them.  Marshal Bernadotte moves onto the map and attempts to break through in pursuit of that main army. Victory levels are determined based on your ability to better the historical result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each 20 minute turn starts with a Command Phase for both sides followed by the French Player sequence and then by the Prussian Player sequence. The sequence includes movement, cavalry charges, fire and melee. During each, morale plays a decisive role. This is a great one player on one player game that can be completed in an afternoon. In addition to the historical game there are two scenarios that vary the orders of battle and appearance times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original rules have been updated but not expanded to any extent. The original designers of the La Bataille Series believe the Premier Rules facilitate the most accurate and competitive play. The new Premier Rules are an update of the original  rules but make it easier to find specific topics and includes some user requested rules such as command control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marshal Enterprises intends to publish a Napoleonic Grand Tactical Game every quarter. The games are free by down loading all the required documents at our website. Each specific title will have a Special Rules Package.  Options include printing the map as a series of 11&amp;rdquo;x17&amp;rdquo; pages or as a one piece file. Instructions are included to make the unit and informational counters. Save some real money and print it all at work!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
