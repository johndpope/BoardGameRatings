			<description>From the Back Cover&lt;br/&gt;Just What You Need!&lt;br/&gt;Chances are your character means more to you than some piece of scrap paper.  So why do you keep you character information on a piece of paper that anyone else would think is trash? Treat that favorite character of yours the way you should with these sheets!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D20 Character Record Sheets includes...&lt;br/&gt;...28 different record sheets that give you a place to record every bit of information you'll ever need to remember about your character and plenty of space to put those additional notes. Inside you'll find&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A double-sided record sheet for every one of the eleven core classes.&lt;br/&gt;     A sheet to record all of that extra equipment, belongings, treasure and other booty you've accumulated through your adventures.&lt;br/&gt;     A sheet for your character's spellbook.&lt;br/&gt;     A character history sheet.&lt;br/&gt;     A sheet for significant NPCs or monsters.&lt;br/&gt;     An adventure log.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tell Me About Your Character!&lt;br/&gt;We're gamers. We all have facts and figures about our favorite characters memorized, but it's not official until it's on the character sheet. And what happens when gaming sessions begin to melt together? How are you going to keep everything straight in your mind? Don't worry.  You've got all you need in your hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
