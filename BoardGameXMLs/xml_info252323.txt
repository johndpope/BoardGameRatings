			<description>In The Incredibles: Save the Day Game, you become a member of the Parr family and become responsible for the safety of Metroville.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players start the game in the middle of the game board, and three problem cards are revealed at random from the deck. The game board includes cut-out pieces, and you flip the areas related to the problems to show what ability &amp;mdash; speed, agility, defense, or strength &amp;mdash; is needed to solve the problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, you roll the movement die, then reveal a new card if the alarm symbol is visible on the die. Sometimes the cards introduce new problems in the city or a roadblock that cuts off your movement; at other times, Frozone shows up to solve a problem on his own, Edna Mode shows up to rescue Jack-Jack (who starts on the game board and is represented by a die), or Jack-Jack teleports somewhere in the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After resolving the card, you optionally move, then if you're on a problem, you roll your die to see whether you get the ability needed to solve it. If someone previously landed on Jack-Jack's space or Edna found him, then you roll the Jack-Jack die as well. Flip the problem card face down on the track if you solve it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If an unresolved problem ever reaches the end of the track, then you all lose the game. If all of the current problems have been resolved (i.e., are face down) and Jack-Jack is with the family, then you all win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
