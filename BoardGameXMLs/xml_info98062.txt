			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the deeps of the southern jungles lay vast stretches of unexplored wilderness. There, forgotten kingdoms lay sprawled in all the ruin of yesterday. Such is the realm of the Entomi, an ancient folk mired in the wicked sorceries of any primitive people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago the Entomi created spirit beings of great power to guard their jungle kingdom. These beings watched over the Entomi lands and protected its people. It was a task they carried out with ruthless efficiency. By taking creatures from the jungles and twisting them, warping them into aggressive, ravening monsters they made the Entomi safe. But the cost was high. In time the Entomi fell to worshiping these creatures, casting aside their gods and driving their priests into the arms of the ever watchful guardians. So they lived for countless years, always in the shadow of those who watched them. But in time the Entomi Kingdom fell, not to war or ravers, but to plague. So they vanished from the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But their guardians remained. Ever watchful, hidden in the jungles overlooking the ruins of a once great and glorious civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This jungle setting is easily adapted to any homebrew world or the official LA game world. They Who Watch is cut in the classic mold. With fantastic monsters, weird, otherworldly settings and wondrous lost treasures! A must have for any would be avatars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
