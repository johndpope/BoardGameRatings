							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Island&#039;s Bounty</name>
									
			<description>Island's Bounty is a treasure hunting board game set on an island. Players take turns rolling their dice, and exploring the grid of hex tiles on the board. Tile locations are marked in a notepad for future reference. Object tiles can be used to to help find treasure. For example, the Map allows a player to look at two face down tiles. Also, traps can be used on opponents. For instance, the Pit causes a player to lose a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has deduced the locations of at least two treasure tiles, the player may then begin placing their dice on the game board. The dice do not tell the exact locations of the Treasure tiles, rather, they tell the distance. The first person to place all three of their dice on the board wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
