			<description>From the front page of the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I awaken slowly, my head throbbing with pain. The first thing I notice is the overpowering smell of brine. The light hurts my eyes as I peer around the room. I am still groggy from ... from ... well, I can't quite remember exactly what happened. Where is this place, anyway? When did I get here? Why does it look like a cross between a torture chamber and a prison cell? Who are all these green-skinned, bug-eyed creatures shambling around? I rub my eyes and that's when I notice the webbed flesh growing between my fingers... A Living Forgotten Realms adventure set in the Sea of Fallen Stars for characters of the Heroic tier (levels 1-10).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure will be of particular interest to characters who played SPEC3-3 Dance of the Sun and Moon, or who have previously encountered agents of the Abolethic Sovereignty. This adventure takes place at the same time in-game as SPEC4-2 The Writhing Obelisk, so a character that plays SPEC4-1 may not subsequently play SPEC4-2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
