							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Islamic Jihad: &quot;The Mother of All Surrenders&quot;</name>
									
			<description>Islamic Jihad is a parodic micro-game about the first Gulf War. It can be played by any number of players, each of whom represents an Iraqi Army commander. Each commander has 100 troops and must travel 10 miles (in 1/10 mile increments) in order to surrender to American troops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is entirely driven by die rolls. Each turn players roll on a main table which directs them to roll on one of six other tables, which may require more dice rolls, etc. Eventually each player will find that they move backwards or forwards some number of spaces or lose some number of troops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
