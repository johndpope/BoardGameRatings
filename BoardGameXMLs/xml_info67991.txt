							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Manufactura</name>
									
			<description>Manufactura is the game that stimulates the productive processes of a factory and the commercialization of its products to the market. It demonstrates the importance of the Lean production, in other words, it shows the concept of producing in a Lean way. This concept was originated with the Toyota Production System and aims at increasing the speed of the processes, eliminating waste and reducing costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the players are presidents of companies which need to produce their products and sell them to the clients. These clients, however, only buy from companies that offer the lower prices. To offer competitive prices, they will have to improve their factories, which present limited production capacity and serious quality problems. The secret is to produce faster, better and with a lower cost. The person who achieves the greater total income is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manufactura may be played by all employees who are part of the productive area of a company, or by those who are just curious about its operational system. With this game, they will all learn and know the Lean culture and its advantages and benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
