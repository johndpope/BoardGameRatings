							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">To Be Emperor</name>
									
			<description>Three hundred years ago, the wandering tribe of Scragen settled at the shores of the Pentibar Sea. Over the decades, the settlement grew to be a great city and from it was born the thriving Empire of Vistos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, Vistos faces a unique challenge. Astemaed, 12th Emperor of the greatest empire the world has ever seen, has died without an heir. By law, it falls on the senate to elect his successor. Very few candidates are worthy in the eyes of the senate. You are among them. Through strength, cunning and the power of your wealth, you must persuade the senate to your side and thwart your rivals' attempts to do the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No higher seat of power exists, no greater title than Emperor of Vistos. Who's coin shall ring the loudest? Who's might shall overcome? Who's knowledge shall prove greatest? The world watches and waits as you attempt... To Be Emperor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Be Emperor is a strategy card game of bidding and resource management. By winning bids on Assets, you gain the resources necessary to maintain Senators you have won to your side as well as to affect game play. By winning bids on Senators, you bring yourself closer to victory. The first player to have persuaded Senators to their side worth 10 or more Influence in the senate is the next Emperor of Vistos. Take care, though. Bid too greedily on senators or use up your resources with haste and you may find the Senators in your pocket seeking deeper pockets elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the files section are PDF and zip files with the rules and all the cards ready for print and play. You will only need to provide tokens (five per player, a different color for each player). All I ask is that you contact me with any constructive criticism and ideas, how many games you played, how many players and how long for each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
