			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story Engine was born in 1996 as the rules system for Maelstrom Storytelling. It was subsequently redesigned as a universal rules system in 1999. One of the initial games to truly handle roleplaying as a storygame, Story Engine was the first to focus on scenes rather than turns-- an idea that has become more and more popular over the years. Story Engine also further evolved the mechanics of adjective-based characters, an idea that had appeared in earlier games, as well as various diceless mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story Bones is the introductory version of Story Engine, stripped to its most fundamental parts. The system is fully-functional and ready to run, but like any lite version of a game, the mechanics have been distilled to their most-basic components for simpler and faster play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
