							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wings of Glory: WW1 Giants of the Sky – German Zeppelin Staaken R.VI</name>
									
			<description>The year is 1918. All across Europe, men face a last-ditch battle in the mud of the trenches, and for the first time in history, a new battlefield is open: the sky. While colourful biplanes gallantly duel each other as true &amp;quot;knights of the air,&amp;quot; colossal &amp;ldquo;giants of the sky&amp;rdquo; also take flight, bringing destruction to distant cities and over the battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wings of Glory is probably the most popular World War One aerial combat tabletop game in the world, with a great collection of pre-painted, ready-to-play model airplanes. Thanks to its elegant and innovative game system, it is possible to start playing minutes after opening the rules. Each airplane has a unique, historically accurate, maneuver deck, yet it is easy to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The German Zeppelin Staaken R.VI was the largest airplane ever to fight during World War 1, with a wingspan more than 30 feet larger than a WW2 B-17 Flying Fortress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This leviathan of the air was used in the last months of the war in pivotal historical events, such as the raids over London in 1918.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wingspan of the R.VI model is about 30 cm (1 foot!). The model will be a complete, ready to play miniature in 1/144 scale, painted and assembled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The model also includes everything you need to include it in your Wings of Glory aerial battles - maneuver deck, airplane card, crew management card and damage counters, new rules, and the special gaming base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
