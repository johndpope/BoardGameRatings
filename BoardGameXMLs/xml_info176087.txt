			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mega Kisses is a world like ours, with one major difference: Manga Cafes offer gateways to strange and fantastical worlds that look a lot like real world fandoms. These places have problems, and your characters, Megas, are there to solve them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a little bit Power Rangers, a little bit Sliders, a little bit Sailor Moon, a little bit Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, a little bit EVERYTHING. Imagination's the limit in these strange genre worlds. Mega Kisses uses Fate Core, and builds off it. To play, you'll need access to Fate Core, or the free Fate Core SRD. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Mega Kisses is a full fleshed Fate Core hack. It tweaks and twists the rules for optimal geeky and genki goodness.&lt;br/&gt;    It introduces Principles to play in these strange genre realms.&lt;br/&gt;    It offers simple, targeted character creation for making your nerdy, otaku Megas.&lt;br/&gt;    Then, it offers rules and Milestones for shifting your characters from world to world and letting their geeky hobbies influence their abilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two kinds of people in the world of Mega Kisses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s most people, and there&amp;rsquo;s people who have been through caf&amp;eacute; wormhole. Anyone can be a Mega, but most people would never believe it. Most people would ignore a wormhole right in front of them. A Mega will walk, run, or even fall in. But a Mega will go through, and a mundane won&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
