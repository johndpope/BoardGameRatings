							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Halo: Fleet Battles – Covenant Core Battle Group Upgrade</name>
									
			<description>The contents of this boxed set can be used by Covenant players to either upgrade their Halo: Fleet Battles force with additional medium and small firepower or act as the foundation for a new force. At the heart of the upgrade box are two powerful CCS-class Battlecruisers and they are joined by 12 SDV Heavy Corvettes, acting as a fantastic core addition to any Covenant fleet. CCS-class Battlecruisers are a key part of any Covenant fleet, able to lay down devastating weapons fire when needed and capable of delivering bombers or interceptors directly into the heart of a battle. Also in the box are Formation Bases and Ship Overlay Sheets for all models included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
