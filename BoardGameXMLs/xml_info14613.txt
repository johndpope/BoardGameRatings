			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Move Your Team - Super Coach TV Football lets you play with the pros or the collegians as they play on TV. And, Coleco furnishes chips to play with. One to four may play. All predict offensive moves and defensive results right on the game board: Before the Quarterback's Call.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Has Heated Pre-Game Warm Up - Players make their team pick. Forecast the home team's or visitor's scores. The closest to the final score of either team wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Predict the Spead - Part of Coleco's pre-game fun is predicting the spread. Guess the spread between opposing teams - closest to the actual result takes all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Predict Each Quarter Score - Dial each quarter score - before the start of the quarter - and get your chips down. At the end of the each period, someone wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Show Your Colors on Every Play - You decide, and declare yourself on these strategic questions, ahead of every play you'll view on TV:&lt;br/&gt;Will it be a pass?&lt;br/&gt;Will the pass be completed?&lt;br/&gt;If complete, how many yards?&lt;br/&gt;Will it be a run?&lt;br/&gt;For how many yards?&lt;br/&gt;Will it be a first down?&lt;br/&gt;Will it be a touchdown drive or not?&lt;br/&gt;Kick a field goal?&lt;br/&gt;Plus - show your savvy on punt and kickoff return yardage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game contains: 1 four color game board, poker chips, 2 football shaped chips holders, 1 solitaire score pad, and 1 instruction sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
