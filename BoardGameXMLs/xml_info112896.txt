			<description>Money Mania is a stock-speculating boardgame which is completely depending on the luck of 4 different specially designed dice.&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played as a basic game, where each turn a player rolls the two Company Dice and the two Share Dice to see which of the four Companies he may trade in and how many blocks of shares may be traded (each dice is marked 1, 2 or 3). When shares are bought or sold the price goes up or down one unit on the central gameboard for every block of shares traded. As the share price changes players attempt to buy low and sell high in order to make the most profit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the advanced game players can expand their possibilities - take out loans and put options. Various random events, such as market trends are also introduced through the use of event cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What adds a little fun is the fact, that you can decide what actions you will take with the different results...&lt;br/&gt;Winner is the first player to amass 1.000.000 credits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
