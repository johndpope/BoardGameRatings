							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Savage Heavy Gear</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heavy Gear is such a great universe. The intent is not so much to perfectly translate every aspect of the game as to make it playable and usable with Savage Worlds rules, while keeping with the spirit and ambiance so dear to Terra Nova. Also, an effort has been made to keep the published material usable with the least effort possible, keeping your library (and purchases!) useful. The bare minimum needed to play would be the Heavy Gear 3rd Edition Player's Handbook (DP9-925), but a copy of the Silhouette Core Rules could come in handy in case of &amp;laquo; shakey &amp;raquo; conversion situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
