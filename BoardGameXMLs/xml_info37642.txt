			<description>While there are probably thousands of variations of the standard &amp;quot;memory&amp;quot; game, this one distinguishes itself because the matches are made by sound rather than visually. The game includes 20 identical-looking bears, but there are 10 different sounds when shaking them based on the material inside the bear. The bears are placed on the board, and in turn players shake on bear and then must find its match. Like other memory games, if they get a match they keep going, otherwise the turn passes to the next player. The bears are nicely made and the some of the sound differences are subtle enough that it requires concentration as well as memory to get the pairings correct.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The title means simply &amp;quot;Bear Hearing Memory&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
