							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Durance Surveyor Cards</name>
									
			<description>From the Durance Kickstarter page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This high quality deck of cards includes all of the colonies and planets, as well as the planet/colony survey assessments, putting everything you need in easy reach. The deck is a set of poker-sized, full-color cards with rounded corners and a glossy finish, making it an attractive addition to your tabletop game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These cards were available as a backer reward for the Durance Kickstarter campaign. All of the survey information from the book is reproduced on these cards, along with additional guest-authored supplemental surveys (which do not appear in the book). The survey process in the game can be accomplished using the survey sheets and what's in the book or using the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
