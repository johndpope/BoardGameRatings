			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My Love for You Is Way out of Line is a peculiar fusion of role-playing and board game that plays out in an office building represented by a chessboard.  One player is Bob, a clumsy and lovelorn office worker who is attempting to court the other player, Imelda, a competent accountant and power worker.  A third player is Gorm, a piece of sea sponge that Bob uses to moisten stamps.  A fourth (optional) player is Nancy, a guard dog that always ends the game by killing Bob.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play involves Imelda randomizing her desires (utilizing &amp;quot;Spark Charts&amp;quot;) and Bob moving about the office (chessboard), trying to work up his nerve, and trying to talk to Imelda.  After several failed attempts he irritates Nancy who kills him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
