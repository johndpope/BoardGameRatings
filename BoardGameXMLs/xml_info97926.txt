							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Terrors of Pellamshire</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to bards tales, when the Grand Squire learned of the fate befell his dear Lady of the Quest, he was driven mad trying to reclaim what was stolen away. After the Paths of Honor failed to restore what he lost the Grand Squire turned to darker dealings, but no power, no matter how deep in the Pit it dwelled, was able to help him on his mad errand. A dark transformation washed over Pellamshire. Monsters, previously unseen walking the lands of men, began to gather. Some would tempt men to their death, others setting traps with grand promises. What follows is a sampling of the evils within the barony&amp;rsquo;s borders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
