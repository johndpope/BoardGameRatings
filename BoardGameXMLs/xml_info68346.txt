							<name  sortindex="1">Royal Geographical Amusement or the Safe and Expeditious Traveller Through all the Parts of Europe by Sea and by Land: An Instructive Game Calculated for the Improvement of the Young Learners of Geography by Dr Journey</name>
									
			<description>The gameboard showing a map of Europe with the principal and capital cities numbered. Together with printed sheet of rules and descriptive text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He who has the highest number in spinning the totum, is to begin, and the others are to follow according to their respective numbers. Three Gentlemen or Ladies are supplied to make the tour of Europe. They are represented by the three Turned Pillars, called Travellers, each of the players having one of these, which is to be placed at the stage corresponding to the number turned up. The four counters, of the same colour with the Traveller, are to be employed as Markers, and take the name SERVANTS. The player is to lay down as many of these as he is ordered to wait turns, and when it comes to his turn to spin again, instead of spinning he must take up one Marker, and so on, till they are all taken up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published December 1st, 1823.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
