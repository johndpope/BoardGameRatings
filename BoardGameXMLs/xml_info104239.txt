			<description>A travel version of Bezzerwizzer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bezzerwizzer kompakt is a game for 2-4 players or teams of players which combines trivia and tactics. Teams earn points for correctly answering questions. For each point scored the team advances one square on the board. The first team to get round the board once wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team randomly draws three category tiles and arranges them on the board according to how knowledgeable they think they are in this particular area. A team will usually put the tile with their &amp;quot;worst&amp;quot; category in the first slot and their &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; category in the third slot. If they answer the question from their first category correctly, they score one point, two for the second, and three for the third. After a round has been completed (i.e. each team has been asked three questions), the category tiles are redrawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team also has 3 switches on the board that they can activate once per round. One is labelled with a &amp;quot;Z&amp;quot;, the other two are labelled with a &amp;quot;B&amp;quot;. The &amp;quot;Z&amp;quot; switch allows a team to swap one of their categories with another team. The &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; switch allows a team to challenge the active team. If the active team can't answer their question but the challenging team can, they earn extra points (one if they used the switch after the question was asked, and three if they used it before even knowing the question). If the challenging team answers incorrectly, they lose one point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Main differences to the standard Bezzerwizzer game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- smaller, travel-friendly box, board and components&lt;br/&gt;- 1200 questions (instead of 5000)&lt;br/&gt;- 12 categories (instead of 20; multiple categories from the standard game were combined into one category)&lt;br/&gt;- each player/team gets three questions per round (instead of 4)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
