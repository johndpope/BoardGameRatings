							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vector V5</name>
									
			<description>Vector V5 is a game of combat between small, fast starships in the distant future. The emphasis in creating these rules has been to provide players with a fast exciting game after a game or two, players will probably not have to refer to the rules at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most innovative aspect of VV5 is the movement system, which is based on the real physics of movement in space. All too often, science fiction films and games assume that starships will behave in the same way as terrestrial ships or aircraft. The truth is quite different as you will see. Once you have played one or two games, the movement rules will become second nature; they're actually much simpler than those used by most other games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules, counters, map, and ship record cards are freely available in Adobe PDF format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
