			<description>Myth. . . history. . . literature. . . law. . .    ROME!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who changed history more, Cicero or Augustus? Who inspired more stories, Hercules or Jupiter? Ancient learning and ancient fun unite in CARD-tamen Rome!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CARD-tamen Rome, The Pericles Group&amp;rsquo;s first CARD-tamen set, is designed to accompany the Operation LAPIS program. CARD-tamen Rome also works beautifully as a stand-alone game involving topics from Ancient Roman culture. This game plays well in any setting, in or out of the classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CARD-tamen is an exciting new card game developed by The Pericles Group, LLC. Intended to promote intelligent discussion and debate about a myriad of topics, CARD-tamen consists of decks of CARDs (Classical Attunement Reward Devices) organized around particular themes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GamePlay: Players shuffle their decks and deal themselves seven CARDs at random. Players have two minutes to provide the most compelling argument as to why their chosen CARD wins a controversy selected by a d20 roll from a list provided with the game. The player who rolls the die to choose the controversy also makes the first argument. An independent iudex (judge) determines whose argument is more compelling. That player is awarded a point. The first player to three points is the winner of CARD-tamen&amp;trade;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also rule variants for 3+ players and integration into the practomimetic Latin curriculum, Operation LAPIS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
