							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shadows over Europe</name>
									
			<description>Shadows over Europe is a two- or three-player game simulating the diplomatic, economic and military development leading up to and eventually being unfolded in World War II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players assume the roles of Germany, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom. Players attempt to outperform each nation&amp;rsquo;s historical record in the world&amp;rsquo;s most gigantic struggle. The game starts in 1935 and ends by an automatic victory or in the summer of 1945.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadows of Europe is played over 11 years, 1935-1945. Each year is represented by three turns; a Between Years turn (diplomacy, resource collection and research), a Winter turn (land operations), and a Summer turn (land and naval operations). Further each turn is divided into several phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental part of the game design is that actions rather than units are hidden from the enemy. This captures the game&amp;rsquo;s ambition to reflect a strategic rather than tactical level. In WWII the concentration of larger forces was often known to the enemy, whereas their strategic intent was not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units are Infantry and Mechanized/Panzer armies, Leaders, Surface raiders, U-boat flotillas, Escort Groups and Convoys. Air forces are abstracted to a combat modifier for each front.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game facilitates two kind of resources: Minerals used for production and Oil for operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rulebook and Playbook:&lt;br/&gt;The 20-page rulebook is clearly written with many examples and designer notes. Also included is a 14-page playbook with extended examples of play, strategy hints and a card index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
