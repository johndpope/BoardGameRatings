							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shit for Brains</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shit For Brains was borne out of a love for bar trivia and a hate for boring facts. Frustrated with questions about Presidents (but not about naked Presidents), and rivers (but not about rivers catching on fire), and animals (but not about weirdly-shaped animal penises), we decided to make a game for people like us. It's a game full of hilarious, morbid, irreverent, outrageous, disgusting, ironic, awesome, pathetic, twisted, and downright weird trivia. Each SFB box comes with 600 cards (6 categories with 100 cards each), a timer, die, and a whole lot of love and bad jokes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is incredibly simple- a team/player rolls the die, and then is asked a question from the corresponding deck. If they answer correctly, they keep the card and roll again. If they get it wrong, it's the next person/team's turn. First team to get one card in each category is the winner! Easy, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starter set comes with the following categories:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Bodily Functions &lt;br/&gt;     Crime &amp;amp; Death &lt;br/&gt;     Drugs, Man &lt;br/&gt;     'Merica &lt;br/&gt;     Nature Calls &lt;br/&gt;     Sexy Time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
