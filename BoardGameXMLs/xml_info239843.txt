			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've Got a Gnoll Problem is a sequel to The Lost Mines of Phandelver. When the first shipment of ore from Wave Echo Cave fails to arrive in Phandalin players will set off to determine the fate of the caravan.  The journey will take them to the Sword Mountains where they will confront a growing threat to the region that must be eliminated and the tragic tale of an undead guardian in need of aid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've Got a Gnoll Problem is a six hour adventure designed for 4 characters of 5th level. It is easily adaptable for any frontier setting. Included in the module are three maps of the region surrounding the Neverwinter woods, one in colour with labeled locations, another in colour without the labels and the last in black and white without the labels. There is also a map of the cave the players will explore in the Sword Mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
