			<description>An adventurous flight over Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Above the Clouds is an entertaining search-and-strategy game for learning geography. Each player must reach his plane some destinations which are assigned to game start. But since everything is under a blanket of clouds, you have to push the right cloud aside to find the right place. By his flight on the board, he may, under the clouds that obscure the destinations, the geographical position of towns, rivers, lakes discover and mountains of his country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But watch the lightning!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
