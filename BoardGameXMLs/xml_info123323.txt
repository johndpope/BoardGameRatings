							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Soap Quiz: Emmerdale</name>
									
			<description>Small quiz game that tests your knowledge of Britain's second longest soap, Emmerdale. No board, just 54 question cards, with six questions per card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your turn, roll the die and the player on your left reads out the question to you that relates to the number thrown. There are six categories on each card. If you get the question right, you keep the card and you roll the die and you are asked the question indicated on the next card, and you keep going until you get an answer wrong. If you are wrong, the card goes back to the bottom of the stack and the turn passes to the player on your left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most cards when the deck runs out, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A solitaire game is also suggested. Turn over the cards one at a time. Roll the die and answer the question indicated. If you are right, place the card on your left and call cards won, the Winning pile. If you are wrong, place it on your right and call those the Duffer's pile. Keep going until all 54 cards are exhausted. Collect 28 or more cards in your Winning pile and you have won. If you have more than 27 cards in your Duffer's pile, you lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
