							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flashpoint Germany</name>
									
			<description>The Greatest Conflict That Never Was&amp;hellip; Flashpoint Germany&amp;trade; brings you back to the height of the Cold War, before the collapse of the Soviet Union. Massive armies of incredible power face off across the West German border. A single decision, a mere moment separated a tense peace from the most intense and possibly the last war that the world would ever behold. The stakes could not possibly be higher. You may think you know how this ends, but in Flashpoint Germany&amp;trade;, it turned out differently. Step into the maelstrom, choose your side and see what you would have done, if you were there. Flashpoint Germany&amp;trade; portrays the highest intensity and density potential combat in human history &amp;ndash; the Central Front of a NATO vs. Warsaw Pact World War III. As the General in charge of a regiment or brigade, you give the orders and let the staff sweat the details. Electronic warfare, tactical doctrine, nuclear and chemical weapons, air strikes, artillery, smoke and minefields are all represented, along with a complete database of accurate equipment and unit types. Your companies and platoons maneuver on realistic maps of the Germany countryside in 2 Tutorials and 17 Scenarios. Build your own scenarios, play against the AI opponent or against another player via TCP/IP or PBEM&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
