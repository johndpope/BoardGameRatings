			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkness crawls across the screen. The soundtrack eerily rises and falls behind the all-too quiet sounds of footsteps. Something shifts in the background. These are the tools and tricks of horror movies. The goal of this game is to bridge the gap between film and games- to allow you to bring that unique form of storytelling to your group of friends. The objective of this game is not to win, but to tell a scary story that follows the same sort of narrative arc of a horror movie. Remember that the only difference between horror and comedy is tone, and choose which one is best for your group. Have fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
