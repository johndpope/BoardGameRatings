			<description>[From back of box]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a fantastic world divided by class and race, technology from a mysterious source has imbued a young prince with the key to unimaginable power. By means of a Neural Network Computer, fuelled by the grey matter of unfortunate 'volunteers', he plans to conquer the known world, replacing it with a new order of his design. The only fly in the ointment is disturbing reports of two powerful elementals storming across the land on a direct course toward the palace. 1 or 2 players can assume the identities of these elementals as they crusade for an unknown master toward a climactic battle. This gripping hybrid shooting/RPG unfolds by means of heart-stopping fully-3D action levels interspersed with gorgeous hand-drawn animation scenes. Fully supporting the GunCon, standard light-gun, analog and standard pads, the ultimate shooting game has arrived. This is the game for which VISA was invented - what are you waiting for?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
