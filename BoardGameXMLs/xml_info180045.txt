			<description>Ladrones (&amp;quot;Thieves&amp;quot;) is a party-game, created by David Vaquero, easy to learn and very funny to play. In this game, 2 to 5 players fight each other for being the best white collar thief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players will try to form a band of specialist in some criminal skills, like strong-box opening or server hacking, to perform the most risky robberys. They could draw cards from the deck or place the highest bid to form their crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player is ready to carry out a robbery, he will announce it and will replace its specialist cards by the respective color specialist dices. The player will have only 30 seconds to get the perfect combination in any dice by throwing them as many times as necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the assault, it doesn't matter if the player has had success or not, it's time to go out and run. The player will have another 30 seconds to throw the Driver's dice to left behind the police and scape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will finish when all the plans of robbery run out or all the available diamonds have gone. The player who has the biggest diamond amount is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
