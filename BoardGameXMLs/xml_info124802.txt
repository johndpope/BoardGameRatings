							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nuclear Sunset: The Southwest</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Sunset: The Southwest is the first installment in a post-apocalyptic campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though written with Mutant Future in mind, this campaign is almost 100% mechanics-free and could easily be adapted to any post-apocalyptic rules set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Sunset: The Southwest contains a map of the region, description of settlements and ruins and a full slate of post-apocalyptic organizations, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hell's Heart: This enormous biker gang strikes terror into the entire southwest as they move from town to town, raping and pillaging with impunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 88th: This pre-war military unit was considered a great experiment in fielding an all-synthetic battlefield command. They have bided their time since the apocalypse and know the time is ripe for them to take control of this shattered world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cartel: This crime family has maintained the family business since before the Earth was destroyed in the great war. In fact, for these ruthless criminals, business has never been better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Marshalls: In the dark days immediately following the great war, a group of self-appointed vigilantes rose from the darkness to maintain justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a land where law is often a comforting dream, the Marshalls settle for justice, even revenge, striking fear in the hearts of the wicked and cruel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
