							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Disciples of the Blade</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Degree in Holy War&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many places on the Earth of 2018, it can be unhealthy to be a vigilante.  As much as is wrong with the world, it can be dangerous to take things into your own hands.  Of course, if you're lucky enough to be contacted by a recruiter of the famous Mars Academy, you might just get a degree in vigilantism!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students of famed adventurer Dietrich Mars are trained in some of the most powerful and unvelievable Martial Arts techniques on Earth.  There's SO much more to it, though.  Dietrich Mars is not only one of the greatest swordsmen of our time, he is also the high priest of a god known as the Prince of Blades.  Is he a madman?  A cultist?  Heretic and blasphemer?  Maybe... but considering the track record of the Disciples of the Blade, he might just be on to something!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meet the affable and lethal Dietrich Mars, his family, and some of his most famous students.  See the training that one can only receive at a special school in Heidelberg, learn the secrets of crafting swords of incredible strength in the modern age, and gain access to the comprehensive list of All the Martial Arts techniques on Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a supplement for Hot Chicks: The Roleplaying Game; you will need the Core Rulebook to play.  You may also want a copy of The Victory System, as this book updates ALL of the Martial Arts abilities that have EVER appeared in Hot Chicks to Victory, and adds those that have been introduced in Victory this far!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's ALWAYS something more to learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
