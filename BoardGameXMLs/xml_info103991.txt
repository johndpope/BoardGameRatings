			<description>From The Box of the Game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Far into the future, on Krion, a remote barren planet orbiting a dying sun, three mining engineers discover the remains of a Warrior Robot, just its head. One curious Engineer kicked the head. It began to speak and told a terrible tale of mankind's destruction of Krion...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...and then the ground beneath began to vibrate, the dust parted, revealing a smooth artificial surface - and they saw that the Warrior Robot head was attached by thick cables to what they were standing on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suddenly the head spoke again, this time of revenge...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Warrior Robot craves vengeance.&lt;br/&gt;   - Force Beams seek to destroy you&lt;br/&gt;   - Droids pursue you&lt;br/&gt;However, you have your Photon Laser and your reactions are fast.&lt;br/&gt;   - Your intelligence is high&lt;br/&gt;   - You CAN survive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
