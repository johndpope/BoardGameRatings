							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Carburetor City</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many ways, Carburetor City is like a dream come true for most post apocalyptic survivors. With the majority of its territory nestled within the safety of bricked walls and razor wired metal fences, those living within the confines are at least safe from the ravages of the wasted ruins. The city has an operating radio station that broadcasts its transmissions across a number of frequencies, thus attracting the business of civil traders and wandering nomads for many miles around. Solar panels, automotive batteries, and experimental mini-power generators provide electricity for the population. Water is collected regularly in the two metal water towers in the community's confines. The tanker trucks used by the scavengers often return with a decent enough supply of recovered fuel, allowing the community's vehicles the chance to keep running. Although food remains a constant concern, gambling at the casino and a brisk trade in the recovered goods from the surrounding metropolitan ruins provides a chance to gain such needed resources from traveling peddlers. For those needing wheels, recovered automobiles, salvaged parts, tires, and mechanic work is also available for a price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
