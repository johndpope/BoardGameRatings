			<description>From rear cover and product introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The village of Nerasi has been at war for as long as you can remember. Hordes of undead, led by a powerful necromancer named Draya (also known as &amp;quot;The Dark Mistress&amp;quot;), have descended in to the valley countless times over the last century. But this time something is different: they seem more organized, more coordinated, more bloodthirsty... and the village is in jeopardy more than ever. With the safety of the village on the line, every man and woman that was capable of swinging a blade was sent to battle. Even though the village was nowhere near the front line it was left undefended, presumed safe due to its distance from the conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, while the battle continues in an area known as The Fields of Bone, a small group of undead creatures have found their way in to the village. With no heroes to defend the common folk, it is now up to you - the above average commoner - to drop the shovel or take off the apron, pick up the nearest weapon and defend yourself and your loved ones from the approaching invaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DM1: Death's Edge is a short delve for a group of of level 0 characters, compatible with the Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edition game system. It is the first part in a three part series called The Dark Mistress Saga. Characters must be created using the guidelines published in the article &amp;quot;A Hero's First Steps&amp;quot; by Philippe-Antoine Menard  in Dragon issue #403, available on the Wizards of the Coast website (DDI subscription required).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
