							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Can of Worms</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Sometimes there's nothing like opening a can of worms to liven up a party. Discover what your friends, family or party goers really think about some of the curliest questions many of us try to avoid, until now. And then learn what Australia really thinks with answers polled nationally by Roy Morgan Research and see if your views are either mainstream or out-of-touch and among the minority? It's non-stop laughter - with some controversy thrown in - that is sure to have everyone talking, well after the game has ended!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How would you answer questions like these?&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Should pole dancing be an Olympic Sport?&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Is it OK to lie to your partner?&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Is opening a car door for a woman sexist?&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Does technology make us lazy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 142 Question Cards, 20 Answer Cards, 54 Tokens, Rules.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is based on an Australian quiz show. Players secretly answer Yes or No to social questions such as given above, then reveal and may discuss their responses. Points are scored if your answer correlates with Australian population survey responses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
