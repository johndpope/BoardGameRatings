			<description>Star Blazers is a very simple hex-and-counter game, based on the famous Japanese anime series Space Battleship Yamato (Uchuu Senkan Yamato). The human player/s have to make a journey from Earth to the planet Iscandar and back within a limit of 26 turns (one year simulated), to save the home planet from deadly radioactivity. The Gamilon player/s have to delay the Yamato and his escort ships, coming in their way, making their path more hazardous with the use of mines and shooting missiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game movement, shooting and counter-attacks are managed by a spinner. Special damage and events are activated by the 8 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game components:&lt;br/&gt;1 game board&lt;br/&gt;1 plastic Yamato stand-up&lt;br/&gt;5 plastic spaceships&lt;br/&gt;5 round plastic parts for spaceships&lt;br/&gt;1 plastic turn counter stand-up&lt;br/&gt;8 special events/damages cards&lt;br/&gt;30 hex counters missiles&lt;br/&gt;30 hex counters mines&lt;br/&gt;Stickers for the Yamato stand-up and for the turn counter&lt;br/&gt;1 spinner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
