							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mc.V&#039;s Magic Jaffa Game</name>
									
			<description>A simple race game included free on the inside of boxes of McVitie's Jaffa Cakes in the UK in 1979 (my copy purchased 15 Aug 79). When opened out carefully, the board could be found printed on three sides of the inner surface of the box.  The fourth side bore the punchable teetotum spinner, along with 4 counters (yellow one side, white the other).&lt;br/&gt;It is very similar to Snakes &amp;amp; Ladders [US: Chutes &amp;amp; Ladders], but with only 50 squares, and with a &amp;quot;Miss a go&amp;quot; square.  &lt;br/&gt;No rules are included - they are not necessary as it is self-explanatory.  A game of pure luck, although I added a sticker with an additional rule to my copy, allowing a little skill to creep in to a two-player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
