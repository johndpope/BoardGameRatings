			<description>&amp;quot;Stretchmo, known in Europe as Fullblox and in Japan as Hikudasu Hippaland (引ク出ス ヒッパランド), is a downloadable puzzle game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for its Nintendo 3DS handheld system. The game was released on the eShop. The game is a sequel to Pushmo, Crashmo, and Pushmo World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game follows the same gameplay format of previous games, in which the player uses Mallo to push and pull parts of the puzzle in order to reach the top. New to this game is the ability to stretch pieces out in addition to pushing and pulling. Some levels also contain hazards that might attack the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After completing a free seven stage demo, players can purchase four additional attractions; Playtime Plaza, Sculpture Square, Fortress of Fun, and NES Expo, which can either be purchased individually or as a discounted set. Purchasing any of the attractions unlocks the Stretchmo Studio, which allows players to create their own puzzles and share them using QR codes. Purchasing and completing all four attractions unlocks a fifth attraction, The Perilous Peak, which features challenging puzzles.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Stretchmo&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
