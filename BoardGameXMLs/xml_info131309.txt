			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Radiance is a way of creating stories with three of your friends. Together you will become a band of narrators collaborating on telling new stories. You will each need a pencil, some writing paper, a small opaque bag, ten read beads and ten white beads. You will also need five candles (place one in front of each narrator and one in the centre between the narrators). These candles symbolize the radiance of the narrators and the world which they will create. (As with any naked flame, please be careful when using these candles).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will also need a place where all of you feel comfortable. Some people enjoy an audience listening to the stories they are creating, whilst other prefer to just have the other narrators present. It all comes down to personal preference. As for time, you'll probably need to create your stories over the course of a few sessions, and the length of each session will vary depending on how much time you have and what you feel is right for you. An easy way to decide how long your sessions should be is for each narrator to say how long they want most movies to be. Much longer than the usual time you and the other narrators like movies to last and you may find yourselves becoming distracted or tired, while much shorter sessions may not provide you with the time needed to give the story sufficient momentum. As for how many sessions there should be, I recommend three to five, but you may find that another amount works better for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
