			<description>Evoking memories of hours spent in scholarly pursuit, players are given a subject of research and told to compile a bibliography made up from books to be found in the Bodleian and its dependent libraries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the game 'readers' are confronted with the familiar frustrations of finding a book that is 'out to another reader' or 'not in place' and with having to deal with such distractions as being tempted away from work into the Kings Arms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This unique and entertaining game comprises a set of 102 cards (the rules say 105, but are incorrect), each portraying a different book; a board representing the libraries and their reading rooms; and chance cards and playing pieces for up to six participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
