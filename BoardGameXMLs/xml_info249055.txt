							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yakuza Kiwami 2</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a whole year since Kazuma Kiryu left the yakuza during the events of the previous title, Yakuza Kiwami. Unfortunately, fate has other things in mind for the Dragon of Dojima. Kiryu will find himself back at the front lines of a possible all-out war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;akuza Kiwami 2 is a re-creation of the original Yakuza 2, completely rebuilt in the Dragon Engine. Experience gorgeous graphics on top of seamless transitions between battles or when entering or leaving buildings. All cutscenes and key voiced lines have been re-recorded to be as true to the original as possible, while reaping the benefits of the most powerful engine the Yakuza series has ever seen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pull off a wide variety of brutal (and hilarious) Heat Actions, and challenge new minigames such as Golf Bingo, the original arcade release of Virtual-On, the return of Yakuza 0&amp;lsquo;s much-celebrated Cabaret (including the return of fan-favorite Yuki!), Majima&amp;rsquo;s revamped Clan Creator, and even SEGA&amp;rsquo;s infamous Toylets!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;his time around, Kiryu isn&amp;rsquo;t the only one running the show &amp;ndash; fans of the Mad Dog of Shimano won&amp;rsquo;t want to miss this new Majima-centric campaign, which features Majima as a playable character, complete with his trusty dagger, and sheds light on his personal journey from the end of Yakuza Kiwami up to Yakuza Kiwami 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
