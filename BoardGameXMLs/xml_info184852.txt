			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;St. Mary's Asylum was condemned in 1984. But that won't stop a group of high school friends going there as the sun sets with the intent to stay the night.&lt;br/&gt;It is supposedly haunted. Legend says that a group of highschoolers tried to stay the night twenty years ago and disappeared.&lt;br/&gt;St. Mary's was originally a sanatorium called Oak Hill until tuberculosis was cured.&lt;br/&gt;It was renamed after Sister Mary, a nun who took it over in the 60's.&lt;br/&gt;It was meant to be used as a home for the criminally insane.&lt;br/&gt;They say Mary was a monster who punished patients for their perceived sins.&lt;br/&gt;Rumors of her bloody reign can be gleaned in tales of forced sterilization, shock therapy, and lobotomies.&lt;br/&gt;Legend goes, one night there was a great storm and the power failed.&lt;br/&gt;The patients got out of their locked rooms and they say they found her, dragged her into the operating room, and chopped her to bits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
