			<description>This game is designed after a very famous TV show &amp;quot;Zaga&amp;quot;, which was presented by Okan Bayulgen in Turkish televisions. In this game players roll a dice and move along the sections of the board. In the trivia section, they have to answer questions about the 80's. In the &amp;quot;persons&amp;quot; section, players have to mimic the persons, described in the card. In the &amp;quot;bet&amp;quot; section, players have to bet on the subject, written on the card for one of the players. In the Zaga-live section, one of the players become a guest for the Zaga show. A very exiting and wonderful game. It has lots of jokes and humor for the taste of Turkish people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
