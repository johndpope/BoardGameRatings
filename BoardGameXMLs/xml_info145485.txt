			<description>Mana Wars is a fast-paced deck building board game where players compete as mages in an arena battle to the death. As players channel the different types of mana, they will be able to customize their deck and adapt to their opponents. The seven types of mana are: Fire, Ice, Earth, Thunder, Light, Dark, and Arcane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Mana Wars, players each start with a beginning deck of cards and draft different cards based upon the mana types that they channel. As the game goes on, your mage will change considerably.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 3 types of cards in Mana Wars are Spells, Reactions and Augments, and Aspects. Spells are cards that are cast on your turn, while reactions and augments affect spells or aspects that are being cast. Aspects are powerful defensive enchantments that allow your mage to gather mana to increase their power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players are able to do a variety of actions with the main goal of killing the other players. Players can either move and cast a spell or aspect card, move further if no spell is cast, or they may channel mana, allowing them to purchase new spell and aspect cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
