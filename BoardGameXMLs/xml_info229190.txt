							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">HALO Missions</name>
									
			<description>A card game for 2-4+ players set in the HALO Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck comprising 6 basic types of cards: Spartan (S), Mission (M), Weapon (W), Enemy (E), Vehicle (V), Special X).  Each card has a Mission Point Value (MPV) ranging from 1 to 5. Some of the types have sub-types. There are 15 cards each for Spartan, Mission, Vehicle, and Special. There are 30 cards each for Weapon and Enemy card types. Each player starts with 10 cards dealt from the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 10 Shield Points (SP). If a player ever has less than Zero Shield Points, he immediately discards 3 cards and loses 5 Mission Points. He then immediately goes back up to 10 SP. 10 SP is the Max, you cannot go over this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns with each turn having 5 Phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.    Insertion Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     Fill your hand to 10 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.    Action Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     You may play (discard) one of your cards to activate its special ability.  Each card type has 1 special ability associated with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.    Attack Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     You may play (discard) one card to attack 1 target opponent. The card must be either an enemy card or an alien weapon or alien vehicle. The target player loses shield points equal to the MPV of the attack card. You cannot pick the same target the player immediately before you picked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.    Objective Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     If possible, you may make one or more melds in this phase - there are 30 types of melds possible. Score mission points equal to the combined MPV of all of the cards in the meld. Discard the melded cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5.    Extraction Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     Regain 2 shield points. &lt;br/&gt;-     Discard down to 9 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to accumulate 100 mission points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
