			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle Mages is a high-scale game that combines tactical real-time strategy, a quality role-playing system, and original adventure elements. The game takes place in a classic fantasy world, where different races, (Elves, Humans, and Dwarves), and nations live side by side. Each of them has their own culture and traditions, which are carefully guarded from external interference. But none of the races realizes that soon it will cease to matter. All the old conflicts will seem insignificant in the face of a new global threat that will turn the world upside down. So put on the mage&amp;rsquo;s cloak and learn how it feels to be an ordinary wizard. You will have to find the strength to right the wrong, to unite various races against common enemy. Dive into this wonderful world, spoiled by insidious traitors and avid ideas - But remember, you and your character are not the centre of the universe, the whole world doesn&amp;rsquo;t go around you. No, the world lives by its own old laws, with its own cares and problems, and you are just an ordinary wizard, no different from anyone else. However, you have a chance to change everything, but you have to fight for it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
