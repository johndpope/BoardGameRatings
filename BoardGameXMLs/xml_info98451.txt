			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three different games will improve your vocabulary and reinforce spelling skills. Letter Match! Pair letters randomly selected by the computer. Spell 'N Score! Create as many words as you can from letters generated at random by the computer. Crosswords! The computer gives you letters. You turn them into words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Letter Match (1 to 4 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play Letter Match, select a square and pull the trigger to reveal the concealed letter for a few seconds. Then, select another square to look for a match. If a match does not occur after two squares are exposed, the next player's turn begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take turns selecting squares until there is a match. When a match is made, a sound is heard. The letters on the two squares remain exposed, the points are awarded to the player and his turn continues. The player with the highest score when the last set of letters is matched is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spell 'N Score (1 to 4 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are given nine letters randomly selected by the Arcade. Now, create as many words as possible, using those letters, within the 60 second limit! It's a race to see how many points you can get for all the words you are able to complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players create words at the same time, and within the 60 second time limit. After the 60 seconds are up, you will be asked to accept or reject your opponent's words. After the player's words are accepted, the Arcade will award one point for every letter. The winner is the first player to reach or pass the selected maximum score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crosswords (1 to 4 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this exciting and challenging word game, points are scored by first creating words from a list of nine randomly selected letters and then placing those words on the board--all within 60 seconds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
