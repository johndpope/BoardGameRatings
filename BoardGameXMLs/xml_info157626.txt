							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">To Kill a Lie</name>
									
			<description>from Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is centred on an investigation by an Eldritch Society team of 3 Tagers and 1 Sorcerer. The team is well trained and equipped to deal with a variety of threats. It stumbles what it initially believes to be the machinations of the Church of All, a covet faction of the Esoteric Order of Dagon (EOD). However, all is not as it seems. An odd alliance between a human sorcerer, his lover and a Shoggoth Lord use monstrous methods to defend humanity from a variety of aberrant threats such as EOD, the Children of Chaos (CoC), and even the PCs. As the conspiracy comes to light, the PCs find themselves racing to resolve the situation before the CoC, the Eldritch Society&amp;rsquo;s anathema, beat them to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though on its surface this scenario seems to be an elite black ops team mission, it is intended to raise some greater questions by exposing the transhuma nist elements of CthulhuTech. In particular, it examines the ways that humanity changes itself to defend itself against the variety of &amp;ldquo;non-human&amp;rdquo; threats. So whilst the PCs seem to be tasked to kill monsters to defend humanity, they will be forced to decide what &amp;ldquo;human&amp;rdquo; actually means.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario includes everything needed to play it, except some dice (ten sided dice). It uses material found in the CthulhuTech Corebook and Vade Mecum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
