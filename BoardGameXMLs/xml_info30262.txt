			<description>Cleave can be played on a checker board. Each player starts with 16 soldiers 8 on each of the back ranks and 8 on the third ranks. All soldiers move like chess rooks. There are two ways to capture the opponents soldiers, by &lt;i&gt;custodian&lt;/i&gt; and by &lt;i&gt;intervention&lt;/i&gt;. Custodian capturing is accomplished by ending one of your soldiers movement next to an opponent's while having one of your own on the opposite side as well. To capture by intervention you move one of your soldiers directly between two opposing soldiers and then capture both soldiers on each side. The edge of the board can be used to complete any line of three, capturing an opponent piece near the edge by either custodian or intevention.  The game is played until one opponent has no legal moves, which he then loses. A player also loses if he is reduced to two or less soldiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hosted for online play by SuperDuperGames.ORG, where it is known as &amp;quot;Mak-Yek&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
