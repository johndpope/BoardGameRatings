							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mind&#039;s Eye Theatre: Laws of the Night Camarilla Guide</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such Tender Prey...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For centuries, the Camarilla has been a monolith weathering the storms of its enemies, led by the Masquerade.  For equally long, it has been a bastion for monstrous elders and their blood-soaked dreams.  Now, in these dwindling nights, cracks are showing in the Camarilla's facade as age and tradition clash with youth and modernity.  Which is the more terrifying enemy: the one outside the door or the locked in with you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such Elegant Monsters...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the guide to the Camarilla for live-action play.  Here is where players will find elder Disciplines, new Merits and Flaws, and the necessary tools to create Gargoyle characters.  For Storytellers, this book is crammed with new material you can use to add depth to your chronicle, from building a city, to managing Influences and creating extra characters for those unexpected events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
