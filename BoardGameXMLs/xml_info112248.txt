			<description>A decade after the best-selling Airline Tycoon comes the long awaited sequel to the legendary tongue-in-cheek economic simulation that puts players in the role of CEO of an international airline! Airline Tycoon 2 will challenge players to run a modern airline, design unique airplanes and grow a run-down carrier into a globally recognized company that passengers practically beg to fly. Airports worldwide are waiting to be explored, but beware&amp;ndash; your rivals never rest! Crafty opponents are also working to dominate the skies... and they won&amp;rsquo;t let anything stand in the way of their goals!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Explore real world airports, from Moscow to New York, with realistic travel conditions and passenger volumes&lt;br/&gt;- Build your ideal fleet of planes &amp;ndash; use the in-game editor to craft inexpensive mass-transportation &amp;ldquo;Greyhounds in the sky&amp;rdquo; or unique, luxury jets that spoil the elite&lt;br/&gt;- Jump into the action as one of four playable avatars with unique strengths and weaknesses&lt;br/&gt;- Explore your home airport in full 3D, while bossing your employees around and expanding your blossoming airline; you might even meet VIPs at the airport lounge&lt;br/&gt;- Test your management mettle in a challenging business environment as you schedule flight plans, coordinate arrivals and departures and balance income and expenses &amp;ndash; all to grow profit and enhance your airline&amp;rsquo;s global reputation&lt;br/&gt;- Random events bring variety to the game &amp;ndash; The Pope wants a special flight? Civil unrest in a global hotspot? Volcanic ash clouds above Europe? If you act quickly, you can profit from these events!&lt;br/&gt;- Sabotage &amp;ndash; annoy and slow down your opponents with devious actions. But beware; your adversaries may just pay you back in kind!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
