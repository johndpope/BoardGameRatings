			<description>Scabs &amp;lsquo;N&amp;rsquo; Guts Board Game is a totally new and exciting &amp;quot;meducational&amp;quot; board game that's packed with interesting and occasionally disgusting medical facts about how your body works. Players or teams take turns to move around the fun and factual body-shaped game board while attempting to correctly answer the multiple choice questions from one of three unique body categories: Scrapes and Scabs, Blood and Guts or Blubber or Buff. When a player or a team correctly answers one question from each of the three categories, they pick up a random question card and have the chance to win the game if they answer correctly. As players move around the body, make sure to keep an eye out for Miracle Cure and Strong Immunity cards that can improve your health and help you win the game. But watch out for the Accidents Happens and Couch Potato cards that could make you ill and slow you down. Scabs &amp;lsquo;N&amp;rsquo; Guts, it&amp;rsquo;s just what the doctor ordered. For 2 or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
