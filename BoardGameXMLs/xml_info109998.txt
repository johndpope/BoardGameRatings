			<description>There are 8 cards for each of the 8 themes. In play 8 rows with the themes are laid out, each theme once in every row, the first player to place all his cards wins the game. In his move a player lays down as many cards as he wants, never two cards from one theme into the same row, but always in the same sequence of themes. If a player cannot place cards, he can switch cards with his stack. Before each placement round players fill up their hands to the maximum and then draw a card from their neigbour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
