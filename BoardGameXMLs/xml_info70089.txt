			<description>Rhymation is a game of word communication in which players attempt to communicate rhyming words to their teammates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blue spaces require teams to guess a list of 4 rhyming words (i.e. chance, pants, romance, lance) within 30 seconds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yellow spaces challenge teams to guess 3 different one-syllable rhyming pairs (i.e. church perch, fun sun, your tour) within 30 seconds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red spaces give teams 30 seconds to guess 2 multi-syllable rhyming pairs (sincere cashier, construction reduction).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grey spaces are &amp;quot;showdown&amp;quot; spaces, in which each team nominates one team member to compete. The chosen players are given one word and must alternate naming as many rhyming words as possible, until one player either repeats a word, gives a word that doesn't rhyme, or takes more than 5 seconds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first team to reach the &amp;quot;high noon&amp;quot; space at the top of the board and win a final showdown is declared the champion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
