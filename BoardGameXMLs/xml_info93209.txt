			<description>The player takes on the role of a member of the Llhedar species, who, because of their psychic abilities and the fact that they never give up until the goal is complete, are well suited for missions such as those in this game. The primary mission of the game is to free the planet Skyla from an alien invasion and the powerful entity known as &amp;quot;Twime.&amp;quot; Little is known about Twime; she seems indestructible because of her ability to exist simultaneously in two different times. The player is able to teletransport between the two times by using the &amp;quot;Dual Time,&amp;quot; a machine created by the sages of Skyla, the Wise. A secondary objective of the game is to avenge the main character's brother, Nash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Chronos Twin&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
