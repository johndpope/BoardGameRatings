			<description>All pirates of the Seven Seas are looking for the Treasure Island, where Barbarosa, the infamous pirate, hid his precious treasure! Are you ready for this incredible voyage? You'll need courage and a bit of luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;L'Isola del Tesoro is a great adventure game with pirates, ships and treasures. It is a game for the whole family, easy to learn, with a fast gameplay and two bonuses for the bravest pirates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;L'Isola del Tesoro is a basic roll and move game, where you are trying to get from the Start tile to the Treasure Island, progressing through all the Sea tiles placed in a line. On your turn, you roll the six-sided die and move as many spaces as the result of the roll. You flip the tile where you land and apply any effect indicated (move forward one space, move to the tile where stands the last ship, skip your turn...). The first player to reach the Treasure Island wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Monster tiles are used to block your progression. When you cross one, you must stop, flip it and stop your turn. On the following turn, you roll the die to try to beat the monster. Whoever beats the monster gets the tile, which doesn't give any advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
