			<description>Description from the game insert:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the same sitting, you can find yourself at the Casino, at the race, at an auction, or playing a friendly game of poker... all the while scratching cards to find out if you have a chance to win or if you have lost your bid.  Scratshow starts with a roll of the dice telling you where your pawn will land.  Are you on a Poker square? Take a scratch card marked Poker and discover your hand.  Place your bet, bluff, raise... Your pawn takes you to the races? Place your bet, scratch a card and find out if your horse is in the Win, Place or Show category.  The first player who gets to be a millionaire wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
