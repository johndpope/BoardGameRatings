			<description>Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Blasteroids&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blasteroids is one of the sequels to the original 1979 shoot 'em up video game Asteroids. It was developed by Atari Games (which later became Midway Games West) and published in 1987 by Image Works for: arcade cabinet, in 1989 for: Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, C64/128, MSX, MS-DOS PC, ZX Spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay for the game is basically the same as for the original; the player (or players in case of a 2-player game) controls a spaceship viewed from &amp;quot;above&amp;quot; in a 2D representation of space, by rotating the ship, and using thrust to give the ship momentum. To slow down or completely stop moving, the player has to rotate the ship to face the direction it came from, and generate the right amount of thrust to nullify its momentum. The ship has a limited amount of fuel to generate thrust with. This fuel comes in the form of &amp;quot;Energy&amp;quot; that is also used for the ship's Shields which protect it against collisions and enemy fire. Once all Energy is gone, the player's ship is destroyed. The ship can shoot to destroy asteroids and enemy ships. The ship can also be transformed at will into 3 different versions, namely the &amp;quot;Speeder&amp;quot;, the fastest version, the &amp;quot;Fighter&amp;quot;, which has the most firepower, and the &amp;quot;Warrior&amp;quot;, which has extra armour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
