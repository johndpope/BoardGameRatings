			<description>From the back of the box (translated):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fun games of logic and set theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game will make fun for all because of its many easy and difficult tasks. Here LEGO bricks can not be used as building blocks, but as a sign of thought content. Even children aged 4 to 5 years old want to learn thinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learning to think in the game. For children, gaming is the appropriate learning situation. That's why games are suggested in the book, whose &amp;quot;rules&amp;quot; trigger thought processes:&lt;br/&gt;The player discover Commons and Differents, draw conclusions, identify and apply rules, develop winning strategies, learn to calculate the probability of chance and the like. All this is amusing and fun, just by playing. Also competing games are in there ... and a portion hidden and open mathematics. The game manual is, however, completely without technical terms. IT is -  written for amateurs and still gives parents, kindergarten teachers and teachers' knowledge of logical and mathematical relationships and thus the background knowledge that facilitates the development of suitable game situations, which in turn develop and support basic skills for thinking of the children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;There are different &amp;quot;boards&amp;quot; included (paper with geometric structures printed on them)&lt;br/&gt;Instead of the figures, stacks of 2 to 3 LEGO bricks are used. There are multiple games which can be played on these boards or without a board only with the bricks.&lt;br/&gt;Included is a 96 pages book full with different games for the material included, and hints for which age and school grade they are adequate.&lt;br/&gt;Some examples for the games:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Nine mans mills&amp;quot; rule&lt;br/&gt;A pachisi game with changing blocking rules&lt;br/&gt;A logical rule guessing game: stacks of 3 colored bricks. Which rule is matching for all. e.g. exact 1 white brick in each stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
