			<description>What is Yags?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yags is Another Game System, one that is meant to be free, generic and modular. There are a number of different articles which describe the different aspects of rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Articles are mostly independent, though all rely on the core rules given here which detail how to define a character's skills and abilities, and how to perform task resolution.&lt;br/&gt;Combat, character generation, magic and other topics are described elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yags is meant for table top, pen and paper, role-playing. Though a computer game based on these rules is in development, it is not a computer game itself. These rules do not explain what a table top RPG is, or how to play one - it is assumed that you already know all this, and are simply interested in how Yags differs from other game systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All these rules are available for download from the Glendale website. &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.glendale.org.uk/yags/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.glendale.org.uk/yags/&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[YAGS core rules]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
