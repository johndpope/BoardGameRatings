							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Swap Meet</name>
									
			<description>From the game box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Today is your neighborhood swap meet! Dozens of folks have hauled their unwanted stuff into their driveways. Swap your old stuff you don&amp;rsquo;t want for&amp;hellip; well, more old stuff, but old stuff you&amp;rsquo;d rather have. Be warned, there are other bargain hunters out there too! Go too slow and you lose the deal. Go too fast and you might miss out on the ultimate swap!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was created as an educational tool to teach students about unit conversion. Players start with certain goods and play cards to convert (swap) those goods into other goods, for example Comic Books to DVDs. Players are competing to complete a Deal by chaining swaps to a shared Goal and collect points based on the number of cards used in the Deal. Play continues for a number of rounds and the player with the most points win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
