							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wasteland Ruins III</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wasteland Ruins series covers random, often generic, city, town, village, and even random smaller ruin locations for post apocalyptic games.  They are meant to be used by GM's looking to set up a quick area for an urban encounter.  Don't mistake them for generic though!  Each map is highly detailed with random decorative elements put in to make the apocalyptic wastelands feel more alive than ever!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wasteland Ruins III is focused on a common city river walk.  Evidence of older battles can be found here, whether that be the partially destroyed office building, or the doomed M1 Abrams tank.   Other minor details that give the map life include a statue to a fallen war hero, a potentially working anti-air tracked vehicle, and a collapsed bridge that may have fallen either due to age or damage from the battles that took place in this area long ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with any of Stoneworker Cartography's battle maps, there is no need to print out the entire battle map.  If you prefer, you can simply print out specific sections of this map and save the other parts for later!  Be sure to refer to the included map print key to help you figure out which sections to print if you're only interested in certain smaller sections of the battle map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PRINT ON DEMAND FANS NOTE:  Stoneworker Cartography is in the process of converting all of our map products into print on demand files, meaning no more worrying about having enough ink, or even bothering with cutting and taping your maps together!  Instead, let us print and cut for you!  In the very near future you will be able to buy pre-printed, high quality maps from Stoneworker Cartography, including this one.  Keep an eye on Wasteland Ruins I and The Galleon as they will be the first to be released as pre-printed products, with more coming soon.  Please check back often and like us on Facebook for up to the minute updates of when other maps go live as print on demand products!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Standard 1&amp;quot; = 5' Scale.&lt;br/&gt;     96&amp;quot; x 72&amp;quot; in size.  Print out the entire night club or just print out the sections you need.&lt;br/&gt;     Hex, Square, and No Grid versions. &lt;br/&gt;     Full Color versions &amp;ndash; These maps are printer intensive, full color versions of each level.&lt;br/&gt;     Black &amp;amp; White versions -  A black and white version that is far less ink intensive than the full color versions.&lt;br/&gt;     VTT Map &amp;ndash; If you prefer to play your games online, there is an included VTT map properly sized for use with VTT software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
