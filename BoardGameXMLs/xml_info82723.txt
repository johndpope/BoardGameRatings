			<description>I.G.I. 2: Covert Strike is a computer game developed by Innerloop Studios and released by Codemasters in 2003. The game is a stealth-based first person shooter. It is the sequel to Innerloop's Project I.G.I.: I'm Going In. The original, published by Eidos Interactive, offered only single-player play with no save game feature. Chris Ryan, a former Special Air Service operative best known for being the lone successful escapee of Bravo Two Zero, served as a consultant to the game. The box art is similar to the poster for GoldenEye.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's plot features a rogue Chinese General, &amp;quot;Wu Xing&amp;quot; as the primary antagonist. Xing orchestrates various events (such as armed robbery of advanced prototype technology from the Russian mafia) in order to get Electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weaponry on a space rocket that he has launch control over. At the end of the game, the protagonist David Jones is finally able to defeat him and stop the launch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was banned in China, because it &amp;quot;intentionally blackened China and the Chinese army's image&amp;quot;. It received generally negative reviews by critics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;IGI 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
