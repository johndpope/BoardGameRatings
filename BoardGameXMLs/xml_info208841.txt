			<description>This gorgeous French game reeks of mid-20th Century science fiction imagery and optimism. While undated, the rules begin: &amp;quot;According to the latest scientific research, it will be possible at the latest in about 50 years, to voyage to the Moon, to other planets and even to stars much further away.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Underneath the beautiful artwork, it is a roll-and-move game, but with one twist. Up to four players try to move their rocket ships from Earth around the board and home. But another player controls the fearsome Robot, who starts somewhere on a separate network of lines between stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Robot network and player track intersect at various points, and if the Robot can land exactly on top of a rocket, that player is out of the game. If all rocket ships are killed, the Robot player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nowhere on the box or board is there any indication of the artist, designer or publisher, or even a copyright or patent claim. The notation &amp;quot;Fr 3185&amp;quot; is printed at the bottom of the rules inside the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
