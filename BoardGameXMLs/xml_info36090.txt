			<description>&amp;ldquo;One player takes the role of the Dragon. The other player takes the role of the Slayer (the adventuring party trying to slay the dragon). There are 2 decks: The Dragon Deck. The Slayer Deck.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Slayer player starts with up to eight randomly selected characters and/or artifacts. The Slayer plays cards to attack the dragon which the Dragon player may attempt to block. The Dragon player then has the opportunity to attack one or more members of the Slayer Party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Victory: If the Dragon is reduced to 0 or less Hit Points the Slayers win. If all party members are killed, the Dragon wins. The Dragon has 10 hit points. Party Members (Slayers: Heroes &amp;amp; Men-at-Arms) have 1 hit point each. Each unblocked attack by the Dragon will kill one party member. Unblocked attacks by Slayers cause 1 or more hit points of damage to the Dragon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
