			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game of deception and deduction based on a 4 way modifiable relationship graph, much like a 4 item version of rock, paper, scissors. There is quite a bit of strategy and great mind games to be had by playing this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with 2 players alternating turns. They start with 16 cards each, 4 of each of 4 abstract symbol types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn one player is the modification player and sets the relationship graph, i.e. symbol 1 beats symbol 2, 3, and 4, symbol 2 loses to symbol 1, but beats 3 and 4 etc. Both players then lay down one card from their hand and then use the relationship graph to see whose card beats the other. If a player's card beats the other's according to the relationship graph, then they score a point. The first player to score 8 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Goal of the game is to win 8 points first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
