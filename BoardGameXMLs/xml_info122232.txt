			<description>&amp;quot;In Paper Glider vs. Gnomes players must jump back into the hot-seat of their paper plane. Pesky garden gnomes are threatening to take over the world with their pokey fishing rods, noisy accordions and rude attitudes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each paper plane that can be thrown at these cheeky gnomes is equipped with a rolling bomb, which when placed correctly, can blow those offensive ornaments to bits. However, it&amp;rsquo;s not always as simple as dropping a bomb...&lt;br/&gt;Gnome alone...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of each level gnomes are hidden behind a unique puzzles, so exploration and experimentation is important to ensure victory. There are three stages and over 60 levels and if all gnomes are destroyed efficiently, three stars are awarded. This will have the hardcore players striving for those perfect games.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
