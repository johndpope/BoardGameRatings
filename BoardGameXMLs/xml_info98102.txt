							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1862: Front Royal</name>
									
			<description>(from &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.wargamedownloads.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.wargamedownloads.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1862  Front Royal (American Civil War in 3D)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This absolutely FREE complementary battle in our series of the American Civil Wargames in 3D sees the Union army under General Nathanial P Banks being attacked once again by the Confederate General Thomas J Stonewall Jackson. This is our second of five battles in the Jackson Valley Campaign of 1862 and the sixth battle in our series of the American Civil Wargames in 3D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historically Front Royal was minor action before the First Battle of Winchester, but what if both sides had committed their forces here and this minor action had escalated. This is a battle that could have easily happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Front Royal initially has a time limit of 14 bounds in which the Confederates must achieve their task objective. Its design allows for a fast, fun and realistic game within a 1 to 2 hour period of continuous play. The game gives a flavor of the American Civil War period and a simple chain of command solution adds intrigue to the game, keep the chain of command together and everything is fine, lose it and it could cost you the game?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit. You don&amp;rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&amp;rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensionally as a straight print and play or 3 dimensionally, this takes a little more time to construct but it is well worth the effort for the impressive game board you get at its completion. The final 3D game board gives you a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
