							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Heat Skateboard Trading Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Description from the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Heat is a revolutionary new trading card game built by skaters for skaters.  Create the ultimate deck by collecting your favorite skater's cards to link together the highest scoring run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an EXTRA BONUS you can collect inserted collector cards of your favorite skaters.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games are played in a series of rounds, or &amp;quot;heats.&amp;quot; Each player creates &amp;quot;lines&amp;quot; or strings of tricks of increasing point value, attempting to score as many points as possible.  If a player can't play all of the cards in their hand, they risk dropping out of a heat early while their opponents continue to build lines.  Once all players have dropped out of the heat, each player scores points equal to the highest value line they've built in that heat.  Play continues over multiple heats, with the high score after an agreed-upon number of heats winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available in 5 different 42-card starter decks, or 9-card booster packs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
