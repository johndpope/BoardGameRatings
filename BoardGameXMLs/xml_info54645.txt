			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACES HIGH is a mythical, western role-playing game where Davey Crockett exists along side The Man With No Name. The relationship, however, may be an uneasy one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Violence is an everyday occurrence on the frontier of Civilization. Dust swirls around a crimson sun, reminding every one of their possible success, telling them of their mortality. Settlers make a grab for the fertile land, destroying whatever does not fit their ideal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prospectors are raping the hills for precious metals; dumping their waste in the fresh, clear rivers. Trappers slaughter vast herds of buffalo for their valuable pelts, leaving a wake of rotting carcasses, a mountain of bone and skulls. The Law can barely cope, as lynch mobs leave cadavers hanging from the trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Redskins fight for their very existence, caught between death and degradation. The old powers cannot compete with the new power from the East. The wise have begun to abandon hope; the young still believe they have a chance to even the score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The people drag a living from the land of dreams but everything is not always as it seems. Ancient mysteries are discovered as the white man slowly conquers this strange new world, mysteries that they are not prepared for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aces High is a deadly supplement for the Basic Roleplaying game. Firearms are very common, it would be considered unusual if your character did not have a firearm of some description. Healing is generally restricted to First Aid and Medicine delivered by a Doctor. Other than that, only natural healing can be relied upon, and that is slow. If your character is involved in a shoot-out you should expect swift and bloody death from all directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
