							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dry Dock</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dry dock and the float out are still reasonably new innovations in the business of shipbuilding. Still this shipyard has decided to employ both in its new constructions. This particular dry dock currently houses the skeleton of a slightly larger cargo ship of a new design. Only a small part of its hull has been attached to keel and ribs as of yet, but barrels of tar and piles of boards are already waiting to be processed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dry dock is essentially a deep pit walled by expertly set stones. No stairs lead down. Only a number of wooden ladders allow access to its depths. Its floodgate is still a primitive construction of two walls of thick wooden beams sealed with tar drenched hemp. Still some water trickles through and collects in puddles in the dock from time to time. Thus it is a continuous effort to keep the dock dry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
