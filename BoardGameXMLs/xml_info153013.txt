			<description>Players in Ene mene miste... need to keep a sharp eye on the chalkboards to see &amp;mdash; and sum &amp;mdash; the items that appear more than once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start the game, lay out the two starting chalkboard cards, then shuffle the remaining 28 cards face-down and set 14 out of play. Turn the top card face-up and place it near the starting cards. If anyone spots an item &amp;mdash; or multiple items &amp;mdash; that appears on two or three cards, she yells out the combined sum of all items that appear on two or three cards. For example, if three bananas appear on one card and two on another, yell out &amp;quot;Five!&amp;quot;; if in addition one pear appears on a card and one pear appears on another, yell out &amp;quot;Seven!&amp;quot; Each player can yell out at most one number, and whoever first yells the correct sum claims one of the face-up cards, then replaces it with the top card of the deck. Whoever claims the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With younger players, you can lay out only two cards at a time to keep the sums smaller and minimize the calculation; with older players, keep four cards in play, possibly adding more cards to the deck to make the game last longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
