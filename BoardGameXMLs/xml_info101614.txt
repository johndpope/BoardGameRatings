			<description>From the Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ambushed and captured! The Dark Elves fell upon you in the dead of night, whilst you slumbered beside your campfire. Subdued and bound, your colleagues murdered, you're marched off a prisoner. You were warned at the last settlement that travelling the Plain of Bronze was dangerous!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After being roughly handled by your captors along grassy tracks for days, you're led into a cold, damp, underground labyrinth of tunnels.

Your destiny; to be a slave in her subterranean silver mines for the rest of your days!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once he's gone, you're filled with a fierce determination to escape. Repeatedly testing your strength against your bonds, you're able to break free after days of hard effort. All your possessions are lost; but they didn't find the dagger secreted in your boot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seizing a burning torch from the wall and brandishing your weapon, you cautiously leave by the only gloomy tunnel. Your mission; to escape these hellish mines or die in the attempt...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
