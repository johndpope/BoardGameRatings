			<description>An UNO variant. Each card shows a short word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal is to get rid of all cards in hand. In turns, players play a card which has the same vowel or the same starting letter as the one on top of the discard pile (or draw one card, if unable to do so).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As usual, there are a number of action cards (draw 2, change direction, ...). Unlike standard UNO, these also have a word that must match up. So it's often not possible to play a 'take 2' directly onto another one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, there are a number of variants; for example, when a player plays a card which starts with a 'z', each player gives his cards to his neighbor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
