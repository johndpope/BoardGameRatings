The game is notable for being one of the first commercial cRPG to take place in Ancient India. The game will be released on Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux platforms, with an announced release date of July 23, 2014.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unrest is a role-playing video game It plays in a 2-dimensional perspective, with graphics designed to look hand-drawn. A large portion of the game will involve making dialogue choices to influence NPCs and progress the story. NPCs will all possess and react based on three values: Friendship, Respect, and Fear. Combat will be relatively rare, always avoidable, and very risky. However, it should be noted that playable character death does not result in a Game Over. Instead the game proceeds to the next chapter, with the previous playable character's death influencing how the story ultimately plays out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Unrest (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
