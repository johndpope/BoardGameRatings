							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Coward&#039;s Guide to Goblins</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How Did I Get Into This Mess?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, hullo. My name is Bucky Bandersnatch, halfling gardener, and I find myself in a terrible prediciment. You see, I've fallen in with some mercenaries who call themselves &amp;quot;adventurers.&amp;quot; More like tomb robbers, if you ask me! But to help keep others from going off on foolish errands like mine, I'm keeping a chronicle of the horrible monsters I encounter - and I begin by detailing a halfling's observation on dastardly, vile, wretched goblins.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Corward's Guide to Goblins provides new rules, options and information regarding goblins, for use with Labyrinth Lord and other old-school fantas role-playing games. In these pages you'll find a terrified halfling's observations on Goblin Kings, Goblin Shamans, Wolf Riders, ambushes, and how to make sure you're the first one to escape from a goblin horde!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in A Coward's Guide to Goblins...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Two variant goblins to plague your Player Characters&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for wolf-mounted goblin warriors&lt;br/&gt;     New tricks and traps employed by these wicked beasties&lt;br/&gt;     ...and much more! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
