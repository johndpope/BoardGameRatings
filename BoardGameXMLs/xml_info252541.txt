							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Talon: A Tarot Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Talon: A Tarot Card Game is a modern tarot trick taking game designed primarily for use with Trionfi Tarot Playing Cards. Each player receives a hand of 12 cards and players bid to become the declarer by stating how few cards they wish to exchange with the talon or kitty. The declarer's side tries to win the majority of card points in tricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three player game is a simplified form of 42 card Tapp Tarock similar to the kind played in Eastern Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game for four players is a streamlined form of K&amp;ouml;nigrufen in which the declarer has the option of choosing a hidden partner by naming a king.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The five or six player games use 66 or 78 cards and blend elements of early Tapp Tarock with Swiss card games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although designed mainly for three to six players; a two player variant, similar to Strohmandeln or Strawman Tarock, is also provided in which players are dealt additional piles of cards in addition to their regular hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
