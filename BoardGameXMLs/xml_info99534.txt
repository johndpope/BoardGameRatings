			<description>Clockworks is a betting game based on Poker. There is a card dealt into the middle of the table which is shared among all players' hands. When a player is dealt a card of the same suit it dealt, he or she can pay to replace the card in the center of the table. Subsequent players can buy the replaced card for their own hand in lieu of being dealt a card. The common card that will actually be used for all hands isn't actually known until the end of the hand. The winner is determined using the regular rules of poker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
