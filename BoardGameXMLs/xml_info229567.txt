			<description>SimplyClever.Cards Derivatives 1 combines traditional playing cards with math flash cards. The deck has 52 cards in 4 colours with 13 different functions that are the derivatives of the 13 functions in the deck SimplyClever.Cards Functions 1, and 4 jokers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card is illustrated with a function expression or graph corresponding to the card value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One joker has a table showing which 4 cards match up for each value, in order to check the math when necessary. The remaining 3 jokers have mathematical operators d/dx, integral and = so you can make your own calculations combining this deck with SimplyClever.Cards Functions 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to be used like a regular deck of cards (including traditional pips for suits and ranks), SimplyClever.Cards Derivatives 1 allows you to play any regular card game you want to - but with a mathematical twist! Game examples: 500, Casino, Crazy Eights, Go Fish, Hearts, Memory, Old Maid, Slap Jack, Snap, UNO etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
