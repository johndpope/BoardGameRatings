							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Managing My Allowance</name>
									
			<description>Managing My Allowance offers valuable first money experiences. Players use coins and bills to pay for purchases, compute change, handle allowances and gifts, collect earnings, and make deposits into college savings accounts. They are rewarded for accuracy, taking advantage of sales, saving money for college, and making thoughtful decisions. Transactions mirror the real world, adding value and excitement. Game variations offer two difficulty levels. In Allowance, the winner is the player with the most money in college savings. No financial transactions are recorded. In Managing My Allowance, players keep simple financial records. The winner is the player with the most money in college savings plus what is saved because of the sales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
