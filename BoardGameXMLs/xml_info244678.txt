			<description>Rabble is a party game for two teams played across three rounds. Teams compete to correctly guess all of the words on their team&amp;rsquo;s Rabble Cards the fastest, but each round has restrictions on the clues that players can give teammates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round 1 - Words, sounds, and gestures are allowed but players can&amp;rsquo;t say the card, part of the card, or spell the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round 2 - Only one word per card but players can&amp;rsquo;t say the card or part of the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round 3 - No words or sounds, only gestures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenge Cards place additional effects on players (and make them do hilarious things), increasing the difficulty of completing each round. The same Rabble Cards are used each round so players need to remember the words and clues from previous rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
