			<description>From the official website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Christmas week of 1979 the world was stunned by the news of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The mighty Red Army was on the move! But in the decade following, the Soviets were fought to a standstill by Afghan guerrillas in an insurgency which was one of the major turning points of the Cold War. In the end, the Soviets withdrew and the Middle East has not been the same since. Soviet-Afghan War is a tactical level simulation of this conflict using the Squad Battles system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;57 stand alone scenarios and 3 campaigns to choose from.&lt;br/&gt;     A wide sampling of actions from all over the country during this 9 year conflict.&lt;br/&gt;     39 unique maps ranging in size from 1900 hexes to 59,000 hexes providing ample ground for scenario designers to create their own actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engine changes include:&lt;br/&gt;    New optional rule &amp;quot;Alternative Fire Density&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;    Bridge destruction with demolition charges.&lt;br/&gt;    Cache and Hidden objectives.&lt;br/&gt;    Rest, for men and weapons.&lt;br/&gt;    Body Armor.&lt;br/&gt;    Vehicle Smoke.&lt;br/&gt;    Chemical/gas warfare ability added.&lt;br/&gt;    A new Database editor to enable users to easily edit the various DAT files included with the game (load, weapon &amp;amp; vehicle).&lt;br/&gt;    A new Parameter Data Editor to easily edit the PDT files that come with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
