			<description>&amp;ldquo;There is no doubt that the simultaneous deaths of the personal doctor of the Empire&amp;rsquo;s ambassador to the City of Gnomes, a dwarven merchant named Nu&amp;ntilde;ez y Carazil, who owned a canton in Amidawa, and Timur ibn Sallah, an astonian burglar serving a sentence in the Morning City have not occurred by pure chance. As we will show here, though nothing obvious points to that conclusion, the three were acquaintances and exchanged coded letters often. Whoever decided to eliminate them, not only learned of this connection, but also had the resources to strike in three different places of the Universe at once. We know then, that we are dealing with two covert organisations: one to which the deceased belonged to, and another which performed the executions. We also know that at least one of them does not stop short of murder.&lt;br/&gt;- Aldobrandino di Gato Nero, &amp;ldquo;The Chronicle of the War of Shadows&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CrystalicuM - Krzysztalowa Gra Karciana (Polish for Crystal Card Game, abbreviated KGK)  is a Polish CCG, set in a 'fantasy/ space opera/ steampunk' universe and with anime/manga like art. The universe is also developed in a Polish role-playing game of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Known Universe there are many secret conflicts, wars and alliances. Secret brotherhoods fight each other, and for them, interstellar powers are only a tokens in the eternal game. The fate of the Universe and its unaware inhabitants rests upon you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Second Edition started in november 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
