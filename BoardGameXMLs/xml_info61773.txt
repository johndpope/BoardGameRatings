							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Book of Experimental Might II: Bloody, Bold, and Resolute</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's back -- and more experimental than ever! This book exists because readers loved The Book of Experimental Might and demanded new options for nonspellcasting classes. In response, Monte shares more creative rules from his own campaign. Here you'll find . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New rules for fighting domains: areas of specialization like Two-Weapon Fighting, Mounted Combat, and Fighting Dirty, as well as techniques based on agility, speed, strength, and intellect. The 15 domains provide new abilities to fighter types willing to devote themselves to a focused path.&lt;br/&gt;     A retooling of the feat system, with three new concepts -- double feats, oblation feats, and uberfeats -- and dozens of new choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special benefits for choosing a feat as a fighter bonus feat, reinstating the fighter class as the king of feats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Optional rules including more combat choices, a method for &amp;quot;boosting&amp;quot; feats for extra benefits, new uses for the Grace/Health system introduced in the first Book of Experimental Might, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like its predecessor, Book of Experimental Might II keeps your characters adventuring longer, enhances existing classes for greater playability, and expands your game options to add to the fun. Continue the experiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
