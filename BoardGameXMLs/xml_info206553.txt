							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Tale of Honor Lost</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the far north of Nippon, in the Mutsu Province, one can find less-traveled and almost secluded areas. Such an area is found surrounding Tanomo, an agricultural area that has been ruled for many years by a much-respected and beneficient Daimyo. But, over recent years, this highly regarded Daimyo has begun to behave in a rapacious manner and virtually loot his own lands and people. With the poverty and distant nature of this area, those outside are unfamiliar with the radical changes that have been taking place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player-adventurers have entered this region and will hope to discover what is going on and what is actually behind the strange behavior of the long-respected Daimyo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
