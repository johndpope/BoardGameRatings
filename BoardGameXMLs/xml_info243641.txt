			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This title contains four fully-stat'ed characters for the BASH superhero roleplaying game that players can use as characters or which Game Masters can use individually or in conjunction with one another as villains! It is fully illustrated with custom images by game industry artist William T. Thrasher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tween Wolf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For years, Will has been dreaming of hunting and fishing in the mountains, living like an old-time &amp;ldquo;Mountain Man&amp;rdquo; with no one to bother him. After running away a number of times, he was found filthy and howling in City Park. Since finding the lump of demonic coal, his dreams have become bloodier. In his normal form, Will is reserved and quiet. In werewolf form, he is definitively neither, and not entirely in control of what he has become.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grim&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the past, Gerda has been described by social workers as detached, moody, emotionless and possibly a danger to others. One foster parent complained that &amp;ldquo;she sucked the life out of a room, y&amp;rsquo;know?&amp;rdquo; Whether that was true in the past is unclear, but it is definitely the case now. Grim&amp;rsquo;s unsmiling features preside over an area devoid of hope or happiness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gargoyle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Garret never stayed in the same foster home or facility for more than a day or two, preferring to live on the streets, or rather, high above them. A gifted climber, Garret would seek out a tenement rooftop and move in, fashioning whatever comforts he could from the stolen goods of others. Now, as Gargoyle, Garret can move about with even greater ease, and take whatever he wants without fear of resistance, or of bullets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darklord&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darrell is obsessed with a particular movie and video game franchise that recounts the eternal struggles of psychic knights of the distant future in a remote galaxy. As many do, he likes to insert himself into the story, living through the lives of the heroes and villains portrayed. But Darrel was always drawn to the dark side of the struggle. When he got the piece of coal from Krampus, he was thrilled when it gave him the dark energy he had always craved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These characters originally appeared in the bestselling Skirmisher Publishing adventure “Krampusnacht: Night of the Krampus” and are provided here on their own with the addition of illustrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
