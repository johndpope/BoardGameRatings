							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TrackMania United</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The game is basically all TrackMania games built into one game that includes all the environments from the earlier games, and, later, future installments of the series. TrackMania United features a peer-to-peer system so players can more easily share custom content, and a unified ranking system. The engine has been updated to include a pre-lighting accelerated system, which is used in the most recent, Stadium environment. The new system allows for more realistic shadows on high end systems. The Stadium environment has double the amount of blocks featured in the free version, including for instance dirt paths, water, and indoor sections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On November 9, 2006, Focus announced 10,000 copies of TrackMania United that could be bought and pre-loaded online. These copies were able to be activated from November 16, 2006. The game became available to buy in shops in France, Canada, Australia, Belgium and the French-speaking part of Switzerland later in 2006, and then from February 23, 2007 in all other regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players who previously purchased the original TrackMania or TrackMania: Sunrise can earn a daily copper bonus in TrackMania United by registering their product keys through the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Trackmania#TrackMania United , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
