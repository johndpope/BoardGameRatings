			<description>A building game where players are acquiring all of the elements the need to build a three-story tower. Players use cards to buy equipment from the stock -- H-beams and joints create substructures, and V-beams are used to build to the next story.  The goal of the game is to be the first player to build a three-story building that consists of three substructures separated by V-beams, and a roof.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play consists of turns where players either buy materials, or use purchased materials to build building elements.  Unbuilt raw materials are vulnerable to card-play from other players that may require them to give over unused materials, or may cause a player to return all unused materials to the supply.  Additionally, some special action cards prevent a player from building until the player resolves a strike, either through the payment of money, or the play of a contract card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
