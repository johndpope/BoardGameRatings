			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Pel you control a movable platform with the arrow keys. Blocks will fall into the screen from the left side. You will need to move the platform to the location of the block which is closest to falling off the screen so it will ricochet up and to the right. Once it leaves the right hand side of the screen it is no longer of concern. There are also bonus items you can grab such as Slow Down which slows the rate the blocks fall, Extra Life which increases your life total by one, Clear All which removes all blocks in play, Triple S which triples your score and Autopilot which controls the platform for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
