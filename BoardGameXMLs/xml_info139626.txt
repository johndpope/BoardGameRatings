			<description>'Let's hunt for some yummy earthworms!'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mogu Mogu Hunt is a fast paced game, where Moles (Mogu's) are trying to bring back some supper.  Players are Moles who are digging into the earth to see what delicious snacks they can find.  They take turns in placing food (visible &amp;amp; hidden) at the end of the tunnels.  Then players take turns in placing path tiles in front of their moles or another players mole, forming tunnels layer by layer into the earth.  Once all the tiles are placed, the paths are resolved.  Each mole follows the tunnel paths downwards, turn at each intersection, and if they reach food they pick that up and score points.   But be careful, sometimes you might end up with some poison mushrooms (-1 point).  The mole who gathers the most delicious food (scores the most points) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first game designed by dGames, and was released at the Tokyo Game Market in Nov 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
