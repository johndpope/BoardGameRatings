			<description>The Koltov Corridor: Disaster at Brody July 1944, simulates yet another disaster for the German Army in 1944. This time, in July, from the 13th to 23rd, the German front at the Koltov area shattered from the weight of the Russian 3rd and 4th Tank armies breaking through a narrow 3-4 km gap in the German lines. As the 8th and 1st Panzer Divisions counterattacked, Russian aircraft filled the skies and wreaked carnage upon the 8th Panzer. Further north, a large German pocket had been created, which attempted to breakout. As German forces were tossed into the relief effort, the front shattered like glass. The 16th Pz and 20th PG Divisions but could barely hold their positions as the two massive Russian tank armies streaked for the Vistula River!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This unique game has both players secretly issuing orders (five to select from) to each one of their formations. When revealed, a player's plan may be enhanced or wrecked depending on the orders issued to the opposing formation! It captures the reality of war quite well. Combat losses are in strength points. The German has a hard road to hold in this game as the Russian tank armies exploit the Koltov gap that is always created. The Russian also has some hefty victory conditions that require most objectives on the map to be in their control. The further west they move, the easier the situation is for the Germans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: 12 hours&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 2 miles / 3.2 kilometers&lt;br/&gt;Units: Battalion to Division&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;Two 11x17&amp;quot; full color maps&lt;br/&gt;Three single-side printed un-mounted countersheets (576 1/2&amp;quot; counters)(mounted counters are optional)&lt;br/&gt;One 21-page rulebook&lt;br/&gt;Five Player Aid Charts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player Provided: Two 6-sided die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Playability: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Low&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 2 to 3 hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
