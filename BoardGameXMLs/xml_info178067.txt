			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Holdfist Mountain range hosted many battles during the Troll Wars and during the dark years many villages, shrines, and castles were destroyed. When the fighting was over the villages were rebuilt so that farmers could resupply the duchy and the former strongholds were lost to the sands of time. One of these forgotten areas is the Church of Scakla and is said to be home to lost magical items...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for a mid-level to high level adventuring party.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
