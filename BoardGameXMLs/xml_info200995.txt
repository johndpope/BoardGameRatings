			<description>Leverage the past, present and future to gain your freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a Shifter. A rare breed of human that has the ability to slip through time at will. But this ability does not come without a cost. Your kind has drawn the interest of an untouchable crime boss known only as Gary. He wishes to not only control the city, but the city today, tomorrow, and yesterday. That&amp;rsquo;s where you come in; an indentured servant, forced into a life of non-linear crime. You can&amp;rsquo;t claim to dislike the rewards of your efforts, but the risks involved have you looking for an exit strategy - a normal life. Not to seem unreasonable, Gary has proposed a game; he is willing to release one of his loyal Shifters upon completion of one last job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You assume the role of one of four Shifters; your job is to fulfill Contracts for your boss, Gary. Contract cards outline a cargo, such as a certain quantity of contraband or an amount of credits that must be delivered to a certain year. Upon fulfilling the Contract requirements, you will receive a reward to help you on your mission.  Each turn you move your pawn forward one month, naturally, within the confines of the nine year timeline of Gary&amp;rsquo;s competition. If you land on a month circled in red, you may choose an additional Contract from those available. Roll the month die to determine if you encounter Gary; will he reward your hard work or punish your incompetence?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next, you choose one of two options.  You may choose to perform any number of actions, including buying and selling guns, drugs, technology, and stocks, depositing to or withdrawing credits from the bank, fulfilling Contracts, or utilizing Subterfuge cards. Use Subterfuge cards to give you one time advantages, such as extra moves, bonus resources, or to sabotage an opponent. Or, you may choose to shift forward or backward one entire year to take advantage of varying levels of supply and demand or to reach a Contract delivery date. However, when you Shift, you must draw an Event card. Event cards can change the level of Technological Innovation, alter the value of Contraband, or manipulate at time&amp;rsquo;s Financial Health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two types of Contracts: standard and release. Standard Contracts are general smuggling jobs and are worth one Contract Point. Release Contracts are tailored to each Shifter&amp;rsquo;s unique skills, but as such, are more challenging. The reward for completion of a Release Contract is that the Shifter named on the Contract receives 5 Contract Points required to win Gary&amp;rsquo;s competition. The first Shifter to collect 10 Contract Points wins Gary&amp;rsquo;s competition and their freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highlights:&lt;br/&gt;Ever changing board conditions and resource values.&lt;br/&gt;You must not only plan your strategy, but monitor that of your opponents; stay one step ahead.&lt;br/&gt;Plays great with 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;Advanced game play option for greater challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
