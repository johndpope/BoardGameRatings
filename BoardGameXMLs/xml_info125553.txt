			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it unless given direct written permission from the publisher which must be noted in the image caption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;designer summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first Shard (world setting) expansion for the Shards of the Shattered Universe Role Playing Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taramythica is a wild and largely untamed world not unlike earth during the dark and middle ages. However, the world in this shard is a distorted reflection of earth, where evolution and cultural development took many twists and turns, vastly different from the original. Numerous intelligent races and creatures, both frightening and wondrous, evolved alongside several subspecies of humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this world, technology and civilization did not develop far beyond the iron age. Due to the primeval nature of this world, and the absence of advanced technologies, its inhabitants have learned to harness the extraordinary powers Mythos and Spirit. These forces are particularly pure and strong in Taramythica.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Taramythica Shard expansion supplements the Core Rules, and will provide players of the Shards of the Shattered Universe Role Playing Game a completely developed, unique and original fantasy setting. The expansion includes new options for character creation, including six human subspecies and six non-human species, each with their own culture. In addition, the set will include an expanded bestiary, new weapons, armor, and equipment, including extraordinary (mythical and spiritual) items ranging from common to legendary power and rarity. Furthermore, the expansion will provide detailed crafting, mythical enchanting, and spiritual empowering rules. Finally, to help get players started in their campaigns and adventures, we have included a large variety of story hooks, unique to each region of Taramythica.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion will be available in softcover and PDF format, concurrently with the release of the Shards of the Shattered Universe Core Rules and Combat Card Sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
