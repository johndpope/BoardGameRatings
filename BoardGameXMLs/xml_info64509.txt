							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Green Day: Playing with Matches</name>
									
			<description>A card game revolving around the rock band &amp;quot;Green Day.&amp;quot; It is a combination of the game Memory and a trivia game, based on knowledge about the band.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Played by shuffling the deck and placing all non-answer cards face down on the table. The youngest player starts by turning over any 2 cards in an attempt to find a match. If they do not match, they are turned back over. If a match is found, that player attempts to answer the questions on the cards. Play passes clockwise around the table. Correct matches receive two points and correct answers to the trivia questions receive 1 point. Players who answer both questions correctly get to take another turn. Once all cards have been matched, the player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
