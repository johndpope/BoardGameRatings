			<description>An ambitious card game based on elements of Hearts, Bridge, Spades, and Pinochle. The deck consists of six suits ranging from 0 to 15, a High Rooler card, a Low Rooler card, and two blank cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is usually played with teams. Players bid in five-point increments from 170 to 300. After everyone passes once, the winner chooses two trump suits. High Trump beats all other suits, even Low Trump. Low Trump beats all suits but High Trump. The Roolerz now take their positions as least powerful, yet most valuable cards in their respective trumps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay proceeds like most other trick taking games. Ordinarily, the highest card in the lead suit wins the trick. The only exception is when trump is played. In that case, the highest trump card wins the trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The blank card may be played at any time, regardless of what suit was led or how many cards of that suit the player has.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the round, points are tallied. Points are only given to players who have the following cards: 15 (scores 15 points), 14 (scores 10 points), 10 (scores 10 points), 5 (scores 5 points), and the two Rooler cards (30 points each). All other cards are worth zero points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A team is set if it fails to win as many points as it bid. The first team to reach 1000 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 2-, 3-, and 5-player games use a dummy hand. In 4-player games there are two teams of two, and in 6-player games, there are two teams of three.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
