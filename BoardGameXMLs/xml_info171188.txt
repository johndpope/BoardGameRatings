			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was the humidity that made the duty miserable. Conus Caedelus stood on the docks of Kerius. Flies swarmed over his armor and crawled under his clothing. He whipped and beat at them in the sweltering heat, but the buckets of sweat just enticed new flies. The summer heat would only worse as the day progressed. The sea breeze was cooler,but it was heavy with water and even with it, he felt as if he were boiling alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When he turned and continued his patrol, he caught a hint of white out to sea. Squinting, he could just make out a sail. No, three sails. No, five. More. Many more. He turned and hollered for his centurion. Gaius Magnus, his red plume proud and high in the air strode over to Conus. &amp;quot;What is it soldier?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Ships, sir.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gaius looked out to see and nodded as he noted the sails as well. &amp;quot;It's about damn time. Let someone else shoot Elves for a living. Maybe this means we'll get a little leave...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sheltered in the lands of Ingrast but beyond the woods of the Elves, this city has remarkable freedom... but with freedom comes danger. Felric's Redoubt is a land of merchants and craftsmen,a cosmopolitan city that acts as a center of trade for all the world. This makes it a hub of culture and learning. Many would say taht it's the axle of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the axle turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
