			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is your character tired of never having the right tool for the right job? Maybe he?s stuck with a rapier against a gibbering mouther or wearing a cold resistance armor against a red dragon. Fear not! Mallyate is here to give a PC what he needs when he needs it for every combat situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 6-page PDF introduces mallyate, an unusual special material that shifts form at its owner's mental command, the material reforming to create a weapon, armor, or shield perfectly suitable to its owner's current needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mallyate is suitable for planar campaigns, high-magic settings, or adventures in which the player characters must constantly change their battle tactics and weapons to cope with a large number of different monsters with varying immunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So grab a chunk of mallyate, mentally shape it into a warhammer to deal with a skeletal menace and then instantly transform it into a greatsword to take down that vile necromancer. With mallyate your imagination is the only limit to the types of weapons and armors you can instantly create.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
