							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Odyssey of Homer</name>
									
			<description>Choppy colorful period-style artwork adorns the board for this roll-and-move point collection game that projects a strong theme of the Odyssey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peril and Destiny cards provide variety to the basic 2d6 movement. If you get too many Peril cards, you return to the beginning of the map, which can be both a blessing and a curse. Destiny and Peril cards often have you performing actions that distract from the goal of the game: to reach the end of the journey so that everyone can tally up points gathered by landing on starred spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first person to reach the end of the journey gets an extra five points, but that's no guarantee of victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
