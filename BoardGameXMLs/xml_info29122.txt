			<description>&amp;quot;It's Grandma Edna's birthday and she longs for her favorite, apple pie. The family gets up early in order to gather all the ingredients from around the farm; apples have to be picked, the grain ground and the cow milked. Everybody is in a hurry as they all want to be the first to surprise Grandma Edna with their apple pie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will, with a bit of luck and a good overview, be the quickest to collect all the ingredients?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game may be played cooperatively or competitively. Players choose a final food (pie, sandwich, etc) and must assemble the ingredients from around the farm. Some items are one step, such as gathering apples, some are multi-step such as feeding hay to the cow to obtain milk which is then processed into cheese.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonus advanced instructions for including cow patties into the equation, possibly a gaming first!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
