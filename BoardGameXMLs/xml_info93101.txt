			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aerospace assets bridge the gulf between the stars in the thirty-first century, making interstellar travel, and interstellar war, possible. WarShips escort JumpShips as they tear a hole in the fabric of the universe to jump thirty-light years towards a distant star; DropShips detach and make the million kilometer trip to the destination planet; aerospace fighters protect the DropShips burning into the destination's atmosphere, as the defender's aerospace fighters rise to meet them -- all to land a MechWarrior and his precious 'Mech on the field of battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AeroTech 2: Record Sheets is an all inclusive book that contains a filled-out record sheet for every conventional fighter, aerospace fighter, small craft, DropShip, JumpShip, WarShip and Space Station, along with all variants, currently in use with in the BattleTech universe. In all, this book contains 319 filled-out record sheets, providing a single book for the complete aerospace assets of the BattleTech universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This behemoth of a book contained printed new record sheets for every aerospace and naval asset in the BattleTech/AeroTech/BattleSpace universe at the time of printing. It's not surprising that an expansion this large also had an errate published for it, the year after printing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This record sheet set is listed as out of print by the current licence holder, and no electronic version is available. With some items from this era being re-printed, it may be that an electronic version could be available in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
