			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Space Chess is a futuristic strategy game for 2 people. The download package includes a 14&amp;quot;x14&amp;quot; game board (separated into 2 files for printing), red and blue Fleet Strength sheets, red and blue Fleet Orders pads, red and blue King pads, and all pieces needed for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player commands a fleet of 6 ships, represented by chess pieces on the game board, and by icons on Fleet Order pads (you can use either chess pieces from a small chess set for movement on the board, or ship tokens, which are included).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is divided into 64 Quadrants. A Quadrant is made up of 9 Sectors, each referred to by its compass position in the Quadrant: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW and C(enter). There are three types of Quadrants: Type I (Light Red), Type II (Light Green) and Type III (Yellow). Both Quadrant Type and Sector location affect ship movement and combat capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to locate and destroy your opponent&amp;rsquo;s King ship. King ships are initially placed on King pads rather than on the game board, keeping their location hidden.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
