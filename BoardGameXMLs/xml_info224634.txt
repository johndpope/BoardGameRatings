			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your company is firing employees; Can you get rid of the bad employee in time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monkey Wrench Is a social game requiring a minimum of 7 people to play, (6 &amp;quot;Employees&amp;quot; &amp;amp; 1 Narrator). The concept of the game is rather simple. The company you work for, has suddenly been having problems with all of its production machines. One of your fellow employees, (players) has been tampering with the machines, &amp;quot;After Hours&amp;quot;. The problem is, no one seems to knows who it is, because every employee seems has an alibi. There for, the Board of Directors, (The Narrator(s)), have decided that one employee will be fired during each &amp;quot;Day Shift&amp;quot; via a 60% majority Employee vote, until the machines are no longer being tampered with. To help facilitate this, a member of local law enforcement (Undercover Cop)and the FBI (in larger games of over 15 players), have secretly joined the ranks of rest of the employees. Their goal, is to help weed out the real problem person; The elusive The Monkey Wrench. However, this individual has an edge: Once per &amp;quot;After hours&amp;quot; round, they can secretly convert one of the other employee towards their goal, and make them into a fellow Monkey Wrench. However, both the Police Officer, and FBI can also once per &amp;quot;After hours&amp;quot; round, secretly &amp;ldquo;Fire&amp;rdquo; or &amp;quot;Arrest&amp;quot; one employee, thwarting their dastardly goals. While the rest of the employees, can all through social deduction, vote during the &amp;quot;Day shift&amp;quot; round, to have 1 of their fellow employees (Players), removed from game. So its up to you fellow employee&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you side with the Monkey Wrench and take down the company? Will you help the Corporate Security to weed out the problem person? Or... are you secretly the Monkey Wrench, all along?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General game play:&lt;br/&gt;Each player is given 3 cards at the beginning of the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 - &amp;quot;Day shift&amp;quot; card, which denotes their public role within the company, that every other player is completely aware of. This card reflects that players normal operations within the company during the day, while they are working. It further operates as  each players &amp;quot;titled&amp;quot; position within a standard normal office environment. Each titled position, is sometimes granted certain abilities, that are usually made public to all players in play, during the &amp;quot;Day shift&amp;quot; phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 - &amp;quot;After hours&amp;quot; card. which designates the given players roles, duties and Private activities when they are not at work, during the &amp;quot;After hours&amp;quot; phase of the game. During this phase of game play, some players are lumber into various secret shadow groups, that operate in secret. Some of them are trying to resolve the crime within the company. Others are trying to ruin the company, by either overthrowing it (Such as the Monkey Wrench), or corrupting the internal operations of the company. While others yet still, have absolutely little value, or influence upon the companies operations, and function as nothing more than benign red herrings, to offset the various groups investigations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lastly, the 3rd card, is the &amp;quot;Vote/ Fire&amp;quot; card. Operates as each individual players ability to either cast a vote against one person they believe should be removed from game, on their &amp;quot;Current player&amp;quot; turn (Fire side of the card), or support another players choice of someone that they believe should be removed from play, (The &amp;quot;Vote&amp;quot; side of the card).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Average game time: &lt;br/&gt;15 minutes for a 7 to 10 person game&lt;br/&gt;30 minutes for a 10 to 15 person game&lt;br/&gt;45 minutes for a 15 to 20 person game&lt;br/&gt;60 minutes for a 20 to 30 person gameIntended age of play:&lt;br/&gt;This game is intended for persons 16 years or older. However, the production website says &amp;quot;18&amp;quot;, only because the options, are 12 or 18. However, the content that is questionable, within the game, is sexually suggestive adult humor, found within 4 &amp;quot;After hours&amp;quot; cards. Which are not essential for general game play, and may be removed as needed for smaller games, of less than 25 persons playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number of players:&lt;br/&gt;A basic game consists of at least 7 to 10 players:&lt;br/&gt;Advanced games can handle 11 to 33 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note, that for every 10 &amp;quot;Employee&amp;quot; players in the game, 1 &amp;quot;Board member&amp;quot; (Narrator), will be needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
