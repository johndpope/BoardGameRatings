			<description>Harking back to the days of Prohibition, BOOTLEG recreates the thrill of running loads of illegal whiskey from city to city wile avoiding the county Sheriffs and the State Trooper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start as bootleggers and must pick up and deliver loads while avoiding speeding tickets or being busted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are just enough restrictions on movement to generate tension when your turn comes. Initially the Sheriffs - one for each county - and the State Trooper are moved automatically after each players turn. But once a player has delivered whatever loads he chooses or, all the loads available (hidden in the bushes) are in transit, he can become a Sheriff or State Trooper just by passing one on the highway. Then he can attempt to bust other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components are of medium quality. 6 Vans, County Sheriffs, 1 State Trooper, 50 plastic chips representing various loads and a stack of money. The rules are very short, perhaps 300 words. The game comes with an additional rules update sheet. The map is plain 4-color and on sturdy paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
