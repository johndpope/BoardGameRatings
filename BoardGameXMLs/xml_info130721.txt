			<description>Children's game to help them learn to tell the time. The main game is a race to complete the jigsaw that makes up the board. Depending on age, allow a player 1 or 2 minutes to finish the jigsaw. The fastest wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The jigsaw features a clock in the centre with moveable hands, and around the clock are activities associated with the time of day. In the second game, a parent can ask such things as &amp;quot;When do you leave for school?&amp;quot; and if a player gets it right, then a point is scored. At the game end, the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
