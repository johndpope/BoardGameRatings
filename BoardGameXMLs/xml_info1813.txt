			<description>The gameboard shows a 5 streets with some government / administration buildings on it plus many plots where houses can be built.  Each person tries to amass the most money by buying plots of land and  either building a building there or selling the land to another player.  Once a house or an appartment is built, money is made buy either selling or renting the property.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acquiring property is either done with cash or with 2 types of loans, one of which takes 2-3 turns to get so thinking ahead is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You travel around the board, and can decide to buy  piece of property on the space next to where your piece stops - either a plot of ground or possibly a developed piece of land.  Once bought you recieve rental income from developed properties, or can later build on undeveloped land (and can sell either type to other players&lt;br/&gt;or back to the bank (at a reduced price).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When moving around the board, there is a chance that random events may occur changing the values of certain properties etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after a pre-determined amount of time, or when all ground plots, houses, and apartments are owned.  Each person then checks the total value of all his properties, subtracting any outstanding loans, and adding his cash - and the person with the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
