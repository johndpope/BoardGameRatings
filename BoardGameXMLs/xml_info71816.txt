			<description>During the I BC century the Senate of the Roman Republic is formed by different factions struggling to increase their power and influence to control the Curia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player leads one of these factions and tries to attract famous Senators and to honor them (to bribe them indeed) with public titles of the Cursum Honorum, what reverts in the growth of power of the faction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided in two phases. During the first phase each player participates in a 15 rounds auction to attract Senators to their respective factions. Each Senator awards direct victory points as well as tribunes (paws) in the Senate, where players try to get majorities in the different parts of it. Each Senator also provides a special and unique power to be played only once per game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the second phase the players enter a new 15 rounds auction, bidding for titles of the Cursum Honorum to grant their previously attracted Senators. But it is never so simple, as important senators do not accept but important titles. All the titles provide direct victory points, new tribunes and a special power that sets off when attached to a Senator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game each player scores their majorities in the Senate and lose victory points for each Senator of their own without an attached title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The auction process includes the possibility to play veto cards, that will deeply change the outcome not only of the auction but also of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
