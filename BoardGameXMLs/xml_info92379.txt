			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of all the armies of the Inner Sphere, none is as universally feared and respected as that of House Kurita's Draconis Combine. With fighting skills learned in the finest academies and tempered by the ancient code of bushido, the MechWarriors of the DCMS  know no equals. Their loyalty and skill are legendary, and their tenacity has won them hundreds of battles across known space. This classified field manual, seized from the Combine's Internal Security Force, reveals the inner workings of the Draconis Combine military, from district regular units to the elite Sword of Light regiments. This document is an invaluable resource for both allies and enemies of the Combine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battletech Field Manual: Draconis Combine contains extensive information about all aspects of House Kurita's military. Every BattleMech regiment of the DCMS is described in detail, including their history, officers and tactics, special rules reflecting the unique abilities of each regiment are included as an optional expansion to BattleTech play. Among the many other features of the book are new weapons, equipment, and BattleMechs unique to the Draconis Combine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most detailed and expansive sourcebook for matters relating to House Kurita and the Draconis Combine since the House Kurita sourcebook ten years earlier, this BattleTech expansion features much more by way of rules and game material than it's predecessor, and provides detail on every major 'Mech unit in serice with the Combine at the time. This sourcebook is currently out of print.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
