							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">El Futbol en Casa</name>
									
			<description>From the United States of America (who could imagine) comes the world&amp;rsquo;s best football board game. El f&amp;uacute;tbol en casa is truly football in the house. Your house. No, it is not a computer game where you pretend to make bicycle kicks, backheel passes, fantastic dribbles, terrific shots, and remarkable saves. It is not a game where the player with the best hand-eye coordination wins.&lt;br/&gt;It is, rather, a football board game where knowledge of football strategy, tactics, and formations is more important than the ability to quickly punch a button or move a lever.&lt;br/&gt;Why pretend you&amp;rsquo;re something you&amp;rsquo;re not? You&amp;rsquo;re not a football superstar and a computer will not make you one.&lt;br/&gt;Why not play a football simulation game where your brain controls movement and play rather than some software program? You don&amp;rsquo;t have the physical abilities of the great players but you may have more overall, intrinsic knowledge of the game they play.&lt;br/&gt;El f&amp;uacute;tbol en casa is a chess-like game of strategy and tactics where, in addition to good and bad fortune (always present in any sporting event), knowledge and skill determine the winner.&lt;br/&gt;You are not a player or a coach. You are the team. You pick the formation. You move the players on your team and pass the ball. You make the tackling challenges and take the shots on goal. You commit fouls, suffer injuries, and get carded. You win. You lose. In short, you experience what a football team experiences.&lt;br/&gt;This is an accurate, well-researched, mathematical representation of association football. All 17 Laws of the Game are incorporated in the play.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the Basic Game that pits two teams of equal strength against one another, a Tournament Play booklet is included that describes how teams of different strengths can play each other. (You could, for example, play all the games of the World Cup Finals.)&lt;br/&gt;This all-wood game is recommended for players 13 years of age and up. Knowledge of football is helpful but not necessary. Also, many materials are included to individualize your game. (If, for example, you don&amp;rsquo;t like the color of your team&amp;rsquo;s kits or jerseys, you can make your own.)&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;(Designer's explanation)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
