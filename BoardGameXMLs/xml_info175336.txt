							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">An Average Modern Jazz Club</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob opened the heavy front door and entered The Ivory Note. The club was dark and the smell of cigarettes still hung in the air from the previous night. He strained to hear movement, but the entire club seemed devoid of life. Quickly and quietly, Jacob walked to the railing overlooking the main club.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reaching into his left pocket, he produced a pair of mirrored sunglasses and slipped them over his eyes. Instantly, the room was awash in green hues. He could easily make out the rows of tables covered in white table cloths and toped with a single white rose. On stage, he saw the white grand piano that was the club's trademark. Hanging above it, he could clearly see the body of a woman in a long dress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A voice boomed. &amp;quot;Ms. Mason sends her regrets. She is tied up at the moment. She hopes that you were join her later.&amp;quot; The statement was punctuated by hideous laughter. Immediately, figures began to appear at the front and rear of the building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where do you go when the action starts? To the battle map, of course! If you need a map of a modern structure, you need Modern Floorplans. The Modern Floorplans series from Fabled Environments offers gamers high quality maps in a variety of configurations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Want to draw it out yourself? Use the 8.5x11 map as a guide.&lt;br/&gt;    Want to simply drop the map on the table and play? Use either the full-scale map (if you have access to a plotter printer) or print the tiled version on regular paper and assemble a full-size version yourself in a matter of minutes. Both versions are scaled at 1 inch equals 5 feet.&lt;br/&gt;    In addition, each floorplan also comes in versions without room labels and without furniture.&lt;br/&gt;    This flooplan take advantage of both the Layers feature and the Tile Large Page function of Adobe Acrobat X&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: All floorplans are rendered in black and white.&lt;br/&gt;All maps are created by an architectural drafter using AutoCAD. This gives all of the maps the realistic feel that your players crave. Grab a copy of Modern Floorplans: An Average Modern Jazz Club today, and keep an eye out for future releases!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the original concept for this map was a small jazz club, this venue is extremely flexible. At the southern end of the building is the main entrance, bar area and a set of bathrooms. The main seating area, consisting of two and four person tables, is slightly recessed. At the northern end of the building is a small stage, dressing room and office. Direct access to these areas are availble through a service door to the right side of the stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't need a jazz club, no problem. Turn off the furniture layer and you have a wide open space perfect for a dance club or small band venue with standing room only seating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
