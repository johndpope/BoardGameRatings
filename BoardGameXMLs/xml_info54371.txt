							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">3d6 Fudge</name>
									
			<description>The complete 4-page pdf file is available in the Files section, below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3d6 Fudge is an alternate way to play Fudge, especially when you don't have Fudge Dice available.  It was inspired by the Min-Mid-Max damage section in Fudge.  It does change how Fudge feels a little, so this may or may not be anything you're interested in.  In particular:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     adjectives are awkward to use in 3d6 Fudge - it's best to switch to numbers;&lt;br/&gt;     the numbers associated with Adjective levels have changed, which long-time Fudge players may find confusing;&lt;br/&gt;     there are no &amp;quot;target&amp;quot; difficulty levels - instead, a roll is compared to the character's level;&lt;br/&gt;     although it requires only elementary-school level math, it's still one step further into &amp;quot;calculations&amp;quot; than Fudge Dice, allowing the possibility of being drawn away from playing the role.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no other real changes.  You still can use all your regular Fudge habits and customizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
