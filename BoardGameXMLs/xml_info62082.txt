			<description>Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can look out over the city and see what you want to see. Maybe you see the bright lights, and it gives you hope. Maybe you see the tall buildings casting their powerful shadows, and it makes you feel small. But high up, it&amp;rsquo;s not that you can&amp;rsquo;t see the forest for the trees&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s that you can&amp;rsquo;t see the trees for the forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best way to see what&amp;rsquo;s really going on? Turn away from the bright lights, big city, and sit down at this card table right here and roll out a map. Take this box-cutter, and just start hacking it up. Slice-slice. The docks go to the bloodsuckers, the banks, too. The projects, we don&amp;rsquo;t know who has them because we can&amp;rsquo;t get close. The park falls to the beasts, and the highways to the jackals. Slice-slice. You cut the place to ribbons, then soak it in blood, because that&amp;rsquo;s how they got what they got&amp;mdash;by soaking the city in blood, theirs and everybody else&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And this right here? This tiny piece, this shitty little nowhere piece that&amp;rsquo;s half the size of a postage stamp? That&amp;rsquo;s your cut. That&amp;rsquo;s your part of this god-forsaken city. You content with that? You satisfied leaving the fatty cuts and the sweet meats for the monsters to fight over? Maybe you are. But I&amp;rsquo;m not. So gear up, because it&amp;rsquo;s liberation time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash; LCpl Erwin Emerson (ret.), leader of the Crusaders of Night cell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BlockThis book includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Systems to run a Hunter: The Vigil chronicle on a larger scale, reclaiming parts of your city from various supernatural factions&lt;br/&gt;     Eight urban territories, complete with story seeds and Storyteller characters, ready to be dropped into an existing chronicle or modified to your troupe&amp;rsquo;s tastes&lt;br/&gt;     Storytelling advice on how to create your own territories, as well as running a Block by Bloody Block chronicle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
