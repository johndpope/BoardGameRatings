							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quarantine D.O.A.</name>
									
			<description>You are all workers in a Top-Secret underground corporate research facility of D.O.A. (Dynamic Oscillating Architecture) when all of a sudden the quarantine alarm sounds. You know what that means. The &amp;quot;Cleaners&amp;quot; are on their way. You only have so much time to get what you need and be where you need to be to enact your plan or else they will &amp;quot;take care of&amp;quot; you. Don't let anyone get in your way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game of Quarantine D.O.A. will be played on a selfishly player made map that will change every game. With a large selection of special room cards all with unique conditions to randomly choose from, no one will know what will be placed until the map is complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will take turns spending actions trying to find the items required to enact their plan. Those that succeed will win. There can always be multiple winners but you don't really know who might help and who will get in the way so to be safe don't trust anyone. Search, steal and push to ensure that you are one of the lucky few, but remember, sometime the no one escapes and the &amp;quot;Cleaners&amp;quot; win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
