							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Dice</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Dice game simulating 2 Superheroes fighting. Victory: To win reduce your opponent to zero hits.&amp;quot; The Superheros start with 50 hits and five Superpowers. There are approximately eighty different Superpowers defined in the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn the players roll five six-sided dice. The players decide which dice are being used for attack and which are being used for defense. Superpowers are then used to alter the dice in various ways. Once these effects are resolved, attack and defense totals are compared. If an attack total is higher, the defender loses a number of hits equal to the difference. If the defense total is higher, the attacker loses the hits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
