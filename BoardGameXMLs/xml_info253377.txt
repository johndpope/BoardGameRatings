							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Digging Up Trouble</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professional brigand, ne&amp;rsquo;er-do-well, and troublemaker Cooper Mutt has come into possession of a map that supposedly leads to buried treasure. As he makes his way towards Houndton, by way of Waterdog Port, he is assailed by a band of ruffians. The party, traveling to Waterdog Port to carry a message, happens upon the scene of this scuffle. With the party&amp;rsquo;s aid, Cooper should be able to easily run the ruffians off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impressed by the heroism of the characters (or because he is bored/lonely/needs extra sets of hands) Cooper asks them to accompany him to find a great treasure! According to his map it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be far from their meeting place at all. Just a little walk toward the riverbank. What Cooper neglects to mention is the fact that there are pirates from the crew of the Miss Fortune hot on his trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters must decide who to trust and possibly fight for their lives as the situation escalates into a wild free for all! The prize is a chest full of plastic, unusual Masterwork items that once belonged to an ancient bandit, and the gratitude (or enmity) of the assembled parties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digging up Trouble is an adventure for characters of levels 1-3 and includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    New NPCs including Cooper Mutt, Captain Windy Whipper, her First Mate Boris Borzoi, and stat blocks for a Pirate Crew!&lt;br/&gt;    A new Masterwork Item: Pine-Scented Plastic Armor&lt;br/&gt;    Several seeds for Future Stories&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
