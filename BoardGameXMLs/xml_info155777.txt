							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Es geht um die Wurst</name>
									
			<description>There are two dogs and six cats. The cats try to steal the Wurst and escape. The dogs have to protect their Wurst. Cats and dogs may move in any direction as many spaces as they roll with one die. Cats can only jump over cats and dogs over dogs. If a dog gets on a space with a cat, he drives the cat from the game board. If the cat has the Wurst, the dog gets really mad and kills the cat. The cats even try to steal the wurst from each other. If a cat escapes with the Wurst, it wins the game. A dog has to kill three cats to win the game (nice doggy).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was published in the 1930s or 40s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
