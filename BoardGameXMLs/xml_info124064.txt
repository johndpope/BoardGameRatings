			<description>This game is played with one of the Clever Playing Cards dual-value decks. Each card in the deck has one value associated with one suit, and a different value associated with a different suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dealer decides which poker variant to play, how to bet, and how the pot will be split between the high and low hands. Each player uses one set of suits and values on the cards to make his high hand, and the other set to make his low hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
