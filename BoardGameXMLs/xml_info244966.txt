			<description>Check the video!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/futboardgame/videos/143893042968456/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/futboardgame/videos/143893042968456...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate tactical Soccer Board Game from Brazil. For everyone who doesn't like the sport, but is in the game. 45 minutes of great excitement for 2 players. Legendary players from all times are waiting to score Goals again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game you have almost all to do as in real match, but with all the strategy of Board Games. Choose between players with different abilities, pass the ball, move your player's tiles and try to score goals. Dices, Rules, Tiles and of course, a Ball!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning, choose your team, the 11 soccer players and place the tiles on the board that is divide by spaces. During his turn, the player has 3 actions to do. When he does not have more actions, the opponent&amp;acute;s turn starts and he has also 3 actions to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiles have indicate how many spaces you can run with your player, and it is an action that you can do. To pass the ball, you will use a rule. The rule will show you if you can pass the ball to another player. Better players have a longer pass, and a pass is also an action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When kicking to goal, check 2 things. How good your kick&amp;acute;s player is, and where in the board you are. If you are too distant from the Goal, you will lose precision of the kick. &lt;br/&gt;Subtract the deficit from the kick, it is indicate in board, and then you will have the total number. Roll the dice D12 and see if you get this number or less. And... it&amp;acute;s goooooal!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game, score more goals than your opponent in 45 minutes. Or you also can choose a 2 goals match. Who else score 2 goals first, win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
