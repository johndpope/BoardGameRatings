			<description>Jinx is a simple dice game whereby players strive to place three of their markers in a row on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only the roll of the dice dictates the placement of your markers.  One white dice and one black dice are rolled.  The spot on the board where those two numbers meet is marked with your color.  If you roll the same combination in the same round, you lose all of your markers currently on the board.  Get three in a row and you win the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Win three rounds to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
