			<description>First in the Doodle Games line from Superlude, Doodle Islands is a &amp;quot;Roll and Write&amp;quot; game from the same author duo as Avenue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll take the role of ambitious ship captains who will roam the sea questing for gold and adventures.&lt;br/&gt;You'll trace your path with the tip of your pen through archipelagos, treasure islands, monsters, ships, rocks and taverns scattered seas! All of this to try and become the richest to receive the title of the Pirate Queen or King at the end of your journey!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure map is broken down in a grid where columns are associated with a face of a black die and the rows with a face of a white die.&lt;br/&gt;Each grid cell holds either a sea monster, an island, a pirate ship or &amp;quot;towers&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn a player will roll a black die and white dice. The player then selects one white die and has to draw a line in the cell corresponding to the black die and the selected white die.&lt;br/&gt;You have to connect two sides of the cell (e.g. top  left, right  left, etc.) but you can chose which sides you want to connect. &lt;br/&gt;You get points whenever you:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     connect a sea monster to an already existing line.&lt;br/&gt;      connect an island to towers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there's already a line where you are required to draw, you have to cross a rum bottle instead.&lt;br/&gt;After that the next player picks a white die, and so on, until all players have done the same.&lt;br/&gt;Then a new turn begins where the player rolling dice is the next one in the turn order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You continue playing round until one player scores 15+ points on a single monster, one player scores 10+ points on a single island or a player crossed out all their rum bottles.&lt;br/&gt;You then add up your points earned with monsters and islands.&lt;br/&gt;And you have to add 4 points per connected pirate ships.&lt;br/&gt;The person who crossed the most rum bottles loses some points and the person who crossed the least earns that amount.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
