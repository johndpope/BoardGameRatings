			<description>(from game insert:)&lt;br/&gt;Now New York is a game! And playing the subway can be fun..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take the subway to 6 of New York's fascinating places of interest. You'll find 36 of them on THE NEW YORK GAME board. Change lines! Detain every player to your advantage. Let those delays, repairs and mix-ups obstruct your opponents' progress. The first one to return to his starting point wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE NEW YORK GAME keeps things moving. It's fast. It's fun. Skill and chance work together to insure a great time for all.
