			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Jewels of Avalon, a fully formed adventure which explores all three islands within the Glamour Isles. This will give your players an overview of the cultural differences between these three Nations as well as their feelings toward the enigmatic Sidhe, a powerful race that shares their lands. The adventure will additionally illustrate how the Heroes&amp;rsquo; Fate can be manipulated in the world of Th&amp;eacute;ah, introducing them to the mad King O&amp;rsquo;Bannon and the mysterious Sophia&amp;rsquo;s Daughters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is divided into three chapters. The first chapter gives a high-level overview of the plot. The second details the adventure, including the Story Steps needed to complete it. Additionally, this chapter includes elements that can flesh out individual Hero Story progressions or provide smaller stories to complete in a single episode. The third chapter includes information on major NPCs that the party will encounter along the way, as well as a new Advantage that can be earned during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
