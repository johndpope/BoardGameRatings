			<description>Masters of Golf is a golf simulation game. It is based on the rules of golf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players use a personal percentage table to determine which club to select. A turn on a wheel determines the accuracy of the hit. Dice determine the direction of flight. If the hit was unsuccessful (for example the ball is possibly out of bounce) an action/outcome card is drafted and the resulting action/outcome is taken (actions/outcomes are based on the rules of golf). A pion marks the place of the ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 9 boards for 9 holes, and the small game/putting is simulated on a separate board. The players can use their own golf statistics to make up their own tables for use in the game. All variants of golf can be played (stableford, strokeplay, matchplay, foursome, fourball, skins)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.masterofgolf.nl/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.masterofgolf.nl/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
