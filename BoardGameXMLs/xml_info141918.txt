							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Duel (Fan Expansion to Dominion)</name>
									
			<description>This is an unofficial fan-made expansion and is not affiliated with nor endorsed by Donald X. Vaccarino or Rio Grande Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory over your neighbors has always been kind of a big deal for you, but just when you thought building yourself the single most impressive empire in the land was all you had to worry about, the stakes went and got higher. Your victory points are now tied to your very life! It all started with that foul-cursed gold. In the future, you will never trust anything given to you by a man in a village who won't stop spinning when you try to look at him. Of course, now you have access to incredible power, but each time you use it, you bring yourself closer to your own demise. With great power comes great responsibility &amp;mdash; or something like that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately, you aren't alone in your fight. A ragtag band of mercenaries has arrived in the kingdom to save the day &amp;mdash; or rather to fight for whoever has the coin. Your mercenaries can wreak havoc on your opponents, but if a stronger warrior takes them by surprise, the resulting curses find their way back to you. This war has turned you into a gambling man (or woman, as the case may be). How much of your own life will you risk to bring down your opponents? Oh, and remember to get your shots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Duel, players need the Treasure cards, Victory cards, Curse cards, and Trash card from Dominion or Dominion: Base Cards to play. As with other Dominion games, players must choose ten sets of Kingdom cards for each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duel introduces several new &amp;quot;Curse&amp;quot; cards to the game of Dominion, the generation of a more advanced &amp;quot;Curse Deck&amp;quot;, and a new token: the &amp;quot;curse token&amp;quot;. It also introduces a &amp;quot;life points&amp;quot; system adding another win-condition to the game; in games with this condition, curse tokens modify a player's &amp;quot;Life Points&amp;quot; total. (If the &amp;quot;Life Points&amp;quot; win condition isn't used, whenever a card requires a player to gain +Y (curse tokens), that player must take one curse token for each curse token specified by the number &amp;quot;Y&amp;quot;. Each curse token is worth -1 VP.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duel also introduces a new &amp;quot;Attack/Action/Reaction&amp;quot; card type, the &amp;quot;Warrior Cards&amp;quot;. The strength of each Warrior Card is represented by a number within a shield symbol for each Warrior Card. The strengths of each Warrior Card range from 1-10, with 1 being the lowest strength and 10 being the highest strength. When a Warrior Card is played as an Action, the player playing the card first resolves the actions printed on the card in order from top to bottom (e.g. &amp;ldquo;Gain a Silver&amp;rdquo; for the Silver Knight; &amp;ldquo;+1 Card then +1 Action for the Warrior Angel). After unique actions have been resolved, resolve the &amp;ldquo;Each other player gains a Curse&amp;rdquo; effect common to all Warrior Cards. This effect causes each player to draw a card from the Curse Deck or play a Reaction card in response.  These Warrior Cards can also be played as a Reaction card to another player playing a Warrior Card as an Attack card; In this case, the two Warrior Cards &amp;quot;Duel&amp;quot; eachother, and the one with the highest power wins the battle (and unique results are followed as indicated on the cards and within the rules).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
