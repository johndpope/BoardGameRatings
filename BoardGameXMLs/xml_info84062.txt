			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your character's just like everyone else. They put their gloves on one hand at a time. The only difference is that their gloves let them shoot flaming arrows from their fingertips. 50 new magic items that let adventurers dress for success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sample:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hat of Summoning (monster)&lt;br/&gt;Twice per day, the owner of this hat can remove it, reach inside, and draw out creatures to assist them in battle. This ability functions as a summon monster III spell (as described in the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Player's Handbook, Third Edition) as though it were cast by a 6th level wizard. The wearer produces a small black egg from the hat which, when thrown before them, cracks and produces a full-sized version of the monster specified. This egg will disintegrate if not thrown in one round. They cannot be stockpiled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
