			<description>Originally available only as part of the Castles and Crusades Boxed Set (Collectors Edition), it is now also available as a free PDF download from the publishers  (See below for link). While the website implies this is the same product as in the boxed set, the PDF has been significantly edited with a different formatting, page numbers, and some added material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 4-6 characters, levels 1-3, introductory adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an introductory adventure for those playing Castles &amp;amp; Crusades. The module has been designed to allow for the players and Castle Keeper alike to begin using the Castle &amp;amp; Crusades rules in a fairly non-demanding game setting. The goal is to familiarize the Castle Keeper and players with the basic rules and their applications while undertaking an exciting adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is also designed for modularity and expansion. Many of the encounters, monsters, settings and non-player characters can be removed from the context of this adventure and placed within those of your own making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further, should the players or Castle Keeper care to continue with the adventure and follow its thematic development, the follow-on module, Assault on Blacktooth Ridge and The Slag Heap is now available. Several references and avenues for continuing the adventure are mentioned within the text, but the Castle Keeper must devise the most meaningful manner in which to carry this out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
