			<description>Publisher summary&lt;br/&gt;You have many whirring eyes and strong, beautiful coiled-steel legs and were made long ago when the cities still stood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Judge Comments&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play as a mysterious mechanical beast with magical powers spreading your domain among the peoples who populate the world. I was so impressed with the visceral world that this game was able to create with so few words. Not only a description or collection of rules, this game is a call to action! Reading through &amp;ldquo;Mechanical Oryx&amp;rdquo;, I feel as though these soft brown people are my responsibility and by not playing I am allowing harm to come to them! The rules are written with enough detail that I don&amp;rsquo;t feel that any mechanics are missing or unexplained, but they are also vague enough that I could fill in the gaps with my own creations to tailor the experience to me and my groups preferences. - Daniel Adams&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was one of three winners in the 200 Word RPG Challenge 2017200 Word RPG challenge 2017[/rpgseries]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
