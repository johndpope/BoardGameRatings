			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a textual adventure (some graphic embellish it, but is purely decorative and has no role in the game).&lt;br/&gt;You give commands usually composed by a verb plus a noun (e.g. &amp;quot;go north&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;examine desk&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;drink potion&amp;quot;) and are told what happens (&amp;quot;you cannot go in that direction&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;there is a pen on the desk&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;you feel reinvigorated&amp;quot;). You have to explore the locations, collect items, use them when appropriate and in general imagine how to overcome the various problems in order to accomplish the final goal of the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are Ken Richards, an egyptology student visiting a small Egyptian village where you learn of a legend about a slave who tried in vain to assassinate the Pharaoh and was devoured by crocodiles. His spirit would still haunt the surroundings looking for vengeance against the descendants of the Pharaoh and will be placated only when the medallion worn by the slave will be found and reshaped via melting into an Anubi statuette.&lt;br/&gt;After a nightmare, you awake to discover that you have been left alone in the village while everyone else has gone to look for the medallion as they do each year... and your adventure begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
