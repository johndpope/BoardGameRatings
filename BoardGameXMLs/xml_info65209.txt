			<description>From the cover -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traps and dungeons go together like bread and butter. They have been a staple of the game from its earliest days. If you've ever designed a dungeon you have probably put in a trap or two (or thirteen) to make the PCs lives more interesting. Sometimes a good trap idea comes to you naturally. But many times you might be stuck for a good trap idea, or maybe you are just in a hurry, or are creating a dungeon on the fly for a quick adventure and don't have the time to think about the traps that might be placed there. That is where Trap Cards come in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trap Cards: Challenge Rating 1 is a product designed to help a GM to easily populate an adventure with a plethora of traps. Trap Cards: Challenge Rating 1 is filled with almost two hundred CR 1 traps, from simple arrow traps to snares to magical traps. We've taken the time to design the traps so they are ready to be used in your adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
