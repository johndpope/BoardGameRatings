			<description>[Wikipedia: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_General&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_General&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People's General (a.k.a. Dynasty General) is a turn-based strategy computer game developed by Strategic Simulations, Inc  (SSI). It was released in August, 1998 in North America and in September, 1998 in Europe. The game originally focused on early 21st century warfare in Asia but both the time-frame and geographic coverage have been expanded by gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People's General, or PeG as it is commonly known, followed SSI's successful 5 Star General Series of World War II war games (Panzer General, Allied General, Pacific General) and their sequel, Panzer General II (PG2). It uses the same game dynamics as these earlier games&amp;mdash;turn-based movement &amp;amp; fighting with military units on a hex based map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
