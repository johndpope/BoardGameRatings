			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a time of troubles for the Jedi Knights. The peace and prosperity of the Republic have made the Order complacent. The Dark Side is everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOW, word has arrived from the distant Outer Rim that the renegade padawan ORDO VALLUS has established a holdfast on the junk world of KONDU. The Jedi Council has hastily dispatched three Jedi aboard the starship BLACKBIRD. Their mission: to bring Vallus back to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, where he will stand trial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOWEVER, when the Jedi ship drops out of hyperspace, it is confronted by the fleet of vile Hutt corsair Bokka the Bold. Bokka broadcasts on all frequencies -- the Jedi are not welcome here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Designer's Notes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is specifically designed to be played as a one-shot and to run to completion in a typical 3-4 hour con slot. As such, it makes two changes to the Lady Blackbird rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, pools are smaller&amp;ndash;only 4 dice instead of 7. This is because the Jedi are powerful in their domain, and don't need as much help from the pool as Lady Blackbird characters do. Also, there are a lot of unanswered questions about these characters and I want the game to push towards refreshment scenes that will get those questions answered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secondly, to help that push towards refreshment scenes, I removed the option to take a pool die as a reward for a Key hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
