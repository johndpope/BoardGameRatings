							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chobolo</name>
									
			<description>Chobolo is a customizable board game in which the board is composed of hex tiles that are themselves each gridded with smaller hexes.  Each player controls a wizard and three warriors, attempting to gain control of the demon Chobolo (initially at the center of the board), travel to the enemy's main tower, and cast a final spell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wizards cast spells by visiting &amp;quot;element&amp;quot; hexes to gather spell components in a stack, then spending the proper components (which must be at the top of the stack and be in the correct order) for the desired spell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters can gain and lose &amp;quot;levels&amp;quot; (bonuses) as the result of (dice driven) combat.  Towers can also be constructed to provide a defensive bonus for characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
