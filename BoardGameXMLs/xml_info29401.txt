			<description>The game where players let it all hang out! Which 3 of the Seven Dwarfs are most like me? Who are my 3 heroes? Players write answers they think others will write on their wipe off board. If they know their friend well, their answers will match and they collect socks from the laundry basket. Whoever forms the most sock pairs wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
