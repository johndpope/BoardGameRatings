							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragon Buster</name>
									
			<description>The 3rd in Namco's series of boardgames based off their videogames. This one is based off the old side view action/ROPG Dragon Buster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The boardgame plays closest to Talisman, although it's not that close of a connection. You roll the dice to move around the board and complete quests.  The game includes a variety of event cards, charts for randomizing events and encounters,counters for monsters and items and such. The point of this game to kill the dragon and rescue the princess (yes, a horribly cliched plot, but it was based off a very early videogame).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a considerable amount of Japanese not only in the rules, but on all the event cards and charts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
