			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fate RPG system was developed from the Fudge system by Evil Hat Productions. It is a very popular system because of its incredible flexibility and the way in which in encourages player creativity in designing exciting characters. It is the ideal system to use for Star Wars, in my mind, hence this adaption. This adaption is a full, stand-alone set of rules that should require no other rulebooks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have done my best to integrate the feeling and mood of Star Wars into the Fate rules as presented here, and have made changes according to my own personal tastes and views on how to use the system. Veterans of the Fate system will notice many small changes, and probably a few large ones as well. As ever, feel free to alter or change them to your tastes so that they produce a better Star Wars game for you. I have consulted and used the rules from several Fate rulesets in making these rules, including Evil Hat's Fate wiki, Strands of Fate, and Cubicle 7's Legends of Anglerre and Starblazer Adventures. You should find and buy all those games and support them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In regards to the Star Wars setting, I have only included enough material to run the game. This is not a campaign setting book with copious notes about the setting; it is the basic rules needed to play there. There is just enough setting here to make the rules make sense. If you need more background information on the setting, I highly suggest you visit Wookieepedia, the amazing fan-run Star Wars wiki, or consult the dozens of books on the Star Wars Universe (including the RPGs by West End Games and Wizards of the Coast). Enjoy, and may the Force be with you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the way, a caveat: I love the Fate rules, but I will always sacrifice some of the simplicity or smoothness to do a better job of reflecting how Star Wars feels to me. As a reader of all the expanded Universe material and a lover of the prequels, that might not jive with everyone's vision of the Saga. I am trying to replicate a more broad and inclusive version of the Saga that uses pretty much all the material, instead of, say, a 3 Original Movies only game, which I concede would probably look different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
