			<description>Don't be a Donut is a quick and easy to play card game featuring the whole cast of Springfield. This fast paced card game is easy to learn and is almost impossible to put down!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play, shuffle all the cards and deal 6 cards to each player. Place the remaining cards face down in a DRAW pile in the centre, than turn over the top card of the DRAW pile. The first player has to match that card either by number or colour i.e. if the card is a red &amp;quot;3&amp;quot; the player must thrown down a red card or any other colour &amp;quot;3&amp;quot;. If a player cannot go they must keep taking the top play until they have a card they can play. Donut cards can be played at any time as long as the background colour matches the existing colour in play and Krusty cards are wild cards and can be played at any time to change the colour of play. The first player to play out all their cards and shout &amp;quot;Don't be a Donut&amp;quot; wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A more advanced play for older children involves scoring and several rounds are played. A game is won by the first player to score an agreed number of points (usually 150). This game is great entertainment for children and because it is presented in a small box makes a perfect travel game. Game includes 54 jumbo sized cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
