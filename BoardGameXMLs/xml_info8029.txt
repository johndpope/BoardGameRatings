			<description>In Medieval Empires each player controls three different empires which attempt to control as much valuable territory as possible. The game is driven by cards, which are used to acquire troops and to fight battles. Players each have a piece which moves around a track by die roll; the space landed on determines how many cards the player draws and how many troops are auctioned off (bidding is conducted with cards). Sets of cards can be turned in for troops in addition to those auctioned off. The track is also the game clock: there is a neutral piece which moves around it and determines when scoring occurs and when the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was produced in an edition of 100 copies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
