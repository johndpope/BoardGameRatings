			<description>Write down a secret word to do with a specific topic and use your imagination. During the game you will have to carry out 5 different tests: coincide with your teammates, try not to repeat the same as them, avoid secret words, discover secret topics and be the one to find the most words, all at blistering page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this word game a card theme is shown and then a dice is rolled to indicate the rule players have to follow this turn. Then they have 30 seconds to write 4 words that accomplish the rule. They will score one point for each right word. At the end of the game the player with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
