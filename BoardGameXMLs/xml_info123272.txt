							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Destiny of an Emperor II: The Legend of Zhuge Liang</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Destiny of an Emperor II is a NES RPG produced and published by Capcom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Destiny of an Emperor II is based on one of China's great books, Romance of the 3 Kingdoms. The game loosely follows Luo Guanzhong's epic tale, with the player controlling Liu Bei and those who fought under the Shu banner during China's Three Kingdoms era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with most NES RPGs, the game transitions between an overhead exploration phase and random battles, similar to Final Fantasy and Dragon Warrior. The different characters of old, leading armies, compose the player's party. The soldiers under the control of each character represent their HP. Player equipment can be upgraded via loot found in chests or bought in shops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, unlike the first Destiny of an Emperor which allows the player to capture enemy officers and later convert them to Liu Bei's cause, the player's party is determined by which point he or she is in the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
