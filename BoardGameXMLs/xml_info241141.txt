			<description>&amp;ldquo;A dark pretentious strategy card game for people who love kids and monsters, just the same.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monsters and Kids is a 2-4 player card game for everyone who loves the bizarre, weird, darkness and more bizarre. (Because you can never have enough of bizarre.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are not afraid of monsters, U.F.O.s or anything supernatural, the kids could really use your help. Save them from disasters and look out for enemies while constantly making sure you have enough cards to survive another turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, in conclusion, Monsters and Kids is a turn by turn strategic card game created by two architects. The strategies range from developing cute illustrations, attractive intro videos, nursery rhymes, dark themes, self-referential humor to deadly aggressive attacks for pulling in maximum people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
