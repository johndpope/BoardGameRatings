							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zulu War</name>
									
			<description>This is a historical simulation, included with Battleplan,No.7,  of the first British invasion of Zululand, in January 1879&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The opposing forces manoeuvre on a map of the terrain divided into 13.5 mile squares.  The Zulu forces comprise impi (army) units represented on the map by named counters and comprising a variable number of ibutho (regimental) units.  These latter, varying in strength from fifty to ten strength points, are kept concealed off-map in holding boxes corresponding to the various impis, until encountered by  a British force.  The British &amp;ldquo; commander&amp;rdquo; is therefore somewhat uncertain as to what faces him.  British forces manoeuvre as six columns (seven according an erratum) plus the static garrison at Rorke&amp;rsquo;s Drift .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles are resolved on a separate battle-board. The British always adopt a defensive posture, either in the open or behind field fortifications.  The Zulus are always the attacking force!  Losses are taken in strength points marked off the players&amp;rsquo; charts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until either player reaches a loss-limit or the British occupy Ulundi for two successive Zulu combat phases.  Victory points are then awarded on the basis of the losses inflicted  and by control of the squares containing the Zulu capital of Ulundi, Rorke&amp;rsquo;s Drift and Middle Drift.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Counters were printed on a section of the mapsheet.  &lt;br/&gt;Die-cut, mounted counters were included as a bonus with Far Seas, Strategy &amp;amp; Tactics magazine #125.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
