							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sea Lord&#039;s Return</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The invasion of the Infernal fleet, the troubles amongst the various factions within the city, the renewed threat of Ymandragore, the threat of war with Altheria, and the rumors of horrors hidden beneath the city have driven it to become a tinder keg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cult of Yig, hidden and thought destroyed, has been biding its time, building strength and waiting for just such a situation as this. K&amp;rsquo;stallo has been preparing some special documents which he is going to have the clergy of Althares distribute throughout the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These documents are the first step in an even more cunning plan than the lighthouse was. With the assistance of Captain Xavier Gordon (a member of the Captain&amp;rsquo;s Council, whose term was extended until the Sea Lord is elected) he has arranged for a gala party and festival to be held to celebrate the renewal of the city, and the aversion of some many of the recent troubles to afflict the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During this festival they are planning on revealing a pair of massive banners that complete the ritual that the earlier papers began.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a complement to this, Captain Xavier has been using the recent political troubles to reshape the landscape of politics and work his way into being the new Sea Lord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario consists of a 20-page PDF scenario and a 16-page PDF (print-and-play) handouts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
