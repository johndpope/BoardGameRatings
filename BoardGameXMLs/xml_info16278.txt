			<description>Sigma is a new deck of playing cards. There are 52 total cards in the deck with 15 distinct types of cards. Each card has a geometric shape on it consisting of 6 squares that are either black or white. Shojiro Doi, the designer, is an amateur 7-dan Japanese Go player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three games have been create by the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escape (2 players) - A &amp;quot;Cat and Mouse&amp;quot; game where one player takes &amp;quot;Black&amp;quot; and the other &amp;quot;White&amp;quot; and they take turns adding cards (tile-placing style) to the current board. The &amp;quot;Black&amp;quot; player's goal is to enclose the &amp;quot;White&amp;quot; player, while the &amp;quot;White&amp;quot; player's goal is to remain free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six (2-4 players) - Each player starts with a quadrant of territory on a board and takes turns playing cards on to the board. Special rules reward players for making a quadrant into a single color or forming lines on the board. First player to play all of his/her cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nine (2-6 players) - Sigma style poker where players bluff and bet that they can best match a pattern selected for each hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
