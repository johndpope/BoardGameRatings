			<description>Barons of Tea is a game for 2-6 players ages 8+. Put on your fancy hat, hop on your boat and get ready for adventures on the high seas!&lt;br/&gt; The British Empire spans across the entire globe and the empire is thirsty. With Barons of Tea you get to step into the shoes of a tea merchant. With 300 pounds of silver in hand and a ship to your name you set off across the sea in a race with other players to be the first to amass 3,000 pounds of silver.&lt;br/&gt; The game play is focused around a commission system, where players race to ports across Africa, India, China and Japan so that they can be the first ones back and receive the highest sale price. The game features seven unique teas, including two special varieties, grown in land-locked regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Barons of Tea there are many different events that can change your fortunes for good or for ill. Each time an odd number is rolled a new event card is drawn. These can bring both good and bad tidings, from finding treasure to finding a dreadful sea beast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
