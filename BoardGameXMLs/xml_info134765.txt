			<description>User Summary by zefquaavius&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barrr is a time management game featuring very cutely-drawn pirates (with small bladders).  Pirates stroll into the bar with 1&amp;ndash;3 activities on their mind.  You direct them to the stations in the order you like.  e.g. darts, then bar, then tattoo artist.  As the stations become available, they head to them automatically (should a traffic jam arise, you can cancel a pirate's itinerary, and &amp;quot;reprogram&amp;quot; him).  Once they're done, they are ready to pay&amp;hellip; or to pee!  Send them to the loo if they have the urge, lest your floor be messed, and a station sit unavailable for a while.  Either way, then they pay, and they're out of your way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
