							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">CityScape Volume 01</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Man with all this construction and demolition I swear this city changes every day!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CityScape consists of modular 6 x 6 tiles that can be used to build a small city. CityScape uses connective tiles such as roadways, bridges, and railways to build the transportation network of the cities. These lead to destination tiles such as a bar, barbershop, basketball half court, bathroom, caf&amp;eacute;, fountain, gas station, grocery, hot dog stand, Laundromat, motorcycle shop, office, park, squatter&amp;rsquo;s home, subway entrance, and town art statue. Some tiles are obstacle tiles such as barricades, potholes, and narrow alleyways created by dumpsters that can cause problems in a chase. Construct a transportation system and a town for today&amp;rsquo;s game. Then put away the tiles and you can make a brand new city for the next game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is intended for use in modern or near future science fiction games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several ways to use the tiles. You can use them to create a small city before play for a wargaming scenario set in an urban environment or a chase or combat inside an urban setting in a role-playing game. Or you can stack the tiles with the logo face up and randomly draw them from a deck to build a town as the group explores it or randomly generate tiles for a board game that needs roads, buildings, and other urban terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Print on Demand module has 88 tiles (single-sided tiles with the DramaScape CityScape logo on the back). This allows you to create a play area of 4 x 4 feet with all the tiles deployed. The Print on Demand version is printed on 12-point card stock and has a UV coat that allows for dry erase markers to be used on the tiles and then wiped off. This surface also allows it to be taped together for stability and then the tape removed just as easily for storage without hurting the tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
