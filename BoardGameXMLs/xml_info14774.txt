			<description>Belisha is a card game that reuses the mechanics of Rummy.  Traffic signs in the United Kingdom make up the theme in Belisha.  Instead of the standard suits and numbers in a 52-card deck, Belisha's cards can be grouped into numbers, colors, and types of traffic signs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Per Rummy, the players are dealt a hand of cards and at the beginning of their turn, draw a card from the deck or the first card of the discard pile.  Their aim is to get rid of the cards from their hand by playing them in sets or straight sequences.  They can play their cards to extend sets or sequences laid out by their opponents.  They must also discard one card in their turn.  The current round stops when a player has played or discarded his last card.  Players sum up the values of the remaining cards in their hands as their score for the round and begin the next by reshuffling the deck and dealing new hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has accumulated a certain score (usually 250) or more.  At that point, the player with the lowest accumulated score is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
