			<description>From the box: The object of the game is to move through the letters of the alphabet from A to Z. The winner is the first person to reach Z. You have two levels of challenge to choose from. Level one Ages 8 and up, level two Ages 12 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basically you move round the board from A to Z and answer questions about nature. You advance one space at a time, when you land on a square has a letter or letters on it you roll the 8 sided dice to decide which of the categories you have to name a nature item on. The six categories are Trees, Edible Plants, Space, Animals, Water, Flowers, Land or any category. You have to name something from the appropriate category beginning with the letter on the square you have landed on. You are not allowed to repeat something that has been used before. In between the letter spaces are alpha nature card spaces, when you land on these you have to answer a question of one of the cards to see if you can advance onto the next letter space. Whenever you answer correctly you move onto the next space, as soon as you are unable to answer a question or name something correctly your turn ends. The winner is the first person to reach the end of the alphabet and name something in the appropriate category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an educational game and there are some variants depending on the players ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
