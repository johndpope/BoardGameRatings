			<description>Adventures in the Hollow World - Missions 4 &amp;amp; 5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having returned to the site of Haldemar and found it destroyed the [player characters] discover that the Azcans have taken the survivors to their capital city to act as sacrifices to their god. Jafidor is incensed as some of his tribespeople have been taken as well. The [characters] will have to travel first across land then across Lake Chitaloc to get to Chitaloc itself. Here they will be captured or turn up in front of the King voluntarily. Either way  they will be taken to the pyramid on the Festival Of Atzanteotl and sacrificed. At the moment when a [character's] heart is about to be removed Mt. Kotlati erupts darkening the sky. This is the chance for the [characters] to escape as the Azcans rarely experience darkness outdoors. The return to the campsite is made with Azcans dogging every step.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This item presents two adventures that are thematically and mechanically linked.  Together, they form part of a longer adventure path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
