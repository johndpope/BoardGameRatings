			<description>From the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your mother wants you dead.&amp;nbsp; Your brother is afflicted by a terrible curse.&amp;nbsp; Your father has been missing ever since your uncle took his throne.&amp;nbsp; There are strange men wandering through your estates, turning up your worst secrets.&amp;nbsp; The Senate is meeting in scant weeks, and your sources tell you that they'll discuss invalidating your claim to your lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And you thought your life was complicated enough when you were using just the corebook!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coronets but Never Crowns is the Family and Politics expansion for Houses of the Blooded that shows you how to let loose your powerful, passionate ven on the world of feudal politics&amp;hellip; and vice-versa.&amp;nbsp; The expansion features six new rules modules which can be added singly or in any combination, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Family, which turns your ven's family into a vicious, scheming nightmare that loves you very, very much and only wants what's &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peers, which shows you how to create new ven nobles and vassals on the fly as you play &amp;mdash; no need to prep NPCs when you can invent them in play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fealty, which details the myriad complexities of feudal contracts, expectations, and loopholes just waiting for exploitation by PCs and NPCs alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Senate, which takes you to Davfanna Aldrena, the Hub of All Revenge, to dive into the ven's most hallowed and dangerous organization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vashna and Horse, which peels back the veil on the House of the Horse and its terrible crimes of serving the greater good&amp;hellip; and how they still work in secret today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coronets Character Creation, an alternate way to create characters that unlocks opportunities to play vassals, lieges, and suaven priests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
