			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mama Llama was a game for the Commodore 64 by the legendary Jeff Minter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 100 attack waves which must be fought off by your Mama Llama and her two babies. You control the Mama and the babies imitate your movements. If either of the babies are killed you continue, but if you lose Mama it's game over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In between levels is a mini strategy game played on a 10x10 grid. The enemies are continually multiplying and you have the ability to place blocking devices to try and contain their growth. You then select one of the blocks to attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was not well received at launch. Zzap64 rated it 59%.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
