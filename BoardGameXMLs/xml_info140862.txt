							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Queen Esther Dancing Dreidels</name>
									
			<description>This game is part of a series of games and is themed for the Jewish holiday of Purim. This entry is the series specifically is aimed at little girls and so focuses on Queen Esther from the Purim story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a set of pieces which depict Queen Esther. These start on a side giving a black and white picture. After the end of each circuit round the board or after certain actions, a player flips a piece to the colored side. The first player to flip all pieces of the picture of Queen Esther to the colored side wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a dreidel in lieu of a d4, and players move round the six points of a Star of David based on the result of a spin. The movement value of a spin and the associated action in regards to a pool of cards for each spin corresponds to the value of a given spin in the traditional game of Dreidel. One set of cards serves to modify the movement results of spins, to protect one from other players' actions and to challenge other players. Another set of cards serves to create sets and so earn Hamentaschen (cookie) tokens which can in turn be used to turn over pieces of the picture of Queen Esther.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
