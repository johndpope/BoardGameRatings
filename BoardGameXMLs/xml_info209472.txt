							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Baby Clues: Skill Cards</name>
									
			<description>This is a mini expansion for Baby Clues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It takes a lot of skill to be a master detective. The tension got higher now all the babies have extra tricks up their sleeves. Give your Baby Clues game an extra wrinkle with special skills cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player received a skill card in the beginning of the game. On the front of the card you have 3 abilities that can be used during your turn and on the back of the card you have 3 abilities that can be used during the turn of another player. When you use your skill you have to discard the card. When you are unmasked by another player you will get your card back so you can use it again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...and there is a small detail you probably should know. Your secret identity will determine the skills you can use. So if you use a skill this also reveals a little bit of your secret identity. Use it wisely!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
