			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MORE THAN A HUMAN WITH POINTY EARS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The races of fantasy are more than funny-shaped humans. See them in a whole new light with this collection of personality features, customized to each race, which you can use in place of or in addition to the personality features from your background. For GMs, when you&amp;rsquo;re creating a new culture of each race, just select a few items from each collection as the culture&amp;rsquo;s dominant outlook to put a new spin on an old classic. Here you&amp;rsquo;ll find personality features for elves (including drow), dwarves, gnomes, halflings, half-orcs, dragonborn, tieflings, aasimar, goblins, and kobolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Use this Collection&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you select a background for your character, you would normally choose or randomly determine two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. After consulting with your DM, either pick 2-3 additional personality features from your race&amp;rsquo;s entry, or replace 2-3 of your background&amp;rsquo;s features with features from this collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These materials were designed for use with 5th edition rules and can be played directly in your 5th edition campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
