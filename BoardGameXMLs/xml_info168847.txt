							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Death of Ulfstater</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death of Ulfstater is a story roleplaying game about the death of a Viking King and the actions of his vassals during the traditional week-long mourning. Players take on the roles of the vassals, using the week of mourning to promote their agendas and sully the reputations of the other vassals in a final effort to prove they are the most worthy of sitting on the throne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the game progresses, we not only learn what kind of vassals served under Ulfstater, but we also learn what kind of person Ulfstater was as well. In the end, Ulfstater will be set ablaze and the smoke will carry his soul to one of the four Norse afterlifes &amp;mdash; F&amp;oacute;lkvangr, Hel, Helgafjell, or Valhalla &amp;mdash; and a new King (or Queen) will be crowned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death of Ulfstater is a competitive game. Characters cannot fight or kill one another during the week of mounring, but everything else is acceptable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
