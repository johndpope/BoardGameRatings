			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE SHATTERED ALLIANCE is a sophisticated strategy simulation centered on the rich fantasy planet of Osgorth and its ethereal trappings.  With the multitude of armies either preassembled or designed by you, you can even conjure up the unlikely confrontation of the Lords of Lockwood and their Osgorthian forces against Alexander the Great's Companions or Caesar's Legionnaires!  Ah, the possibilities!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The computer paints in beautiful, color Hi-Res graphics an Osgorthian battlefield of knolls, mountains, forests, and open plains.  Unit types are categorized into five classes of infantry and four of cavalry.  The tribes that populate this world are as varied as they are enchanted: dwarves, elves, unicorns, amazons, centaurs, just to name a few.  Your fantasy soldiers have been carefully rated for speed, strength, and morale.  They may bear no armor or come amply protected by leather, scale/chain mail, or shields.  Their weapons may be the bow, javelin, rocks, spears, pikes, swords, axes, clubs, or cavalry lance...and of course, spells that can magically enhance a unit's speed, defensive and attacking power, or courage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As richly detailed as this game is, it never becomes unwieldy because the computer keeps track of everything.  Furthermore, its simple but elegant movement system was designed so that all action can proceed at a brisk pace.  It also comes with a powerful and intelligent computer opponent for solitaire play.  THE SHATTERED ALLIANCE is fun, fast, and easy to play - whose sole purpose is to enchant your imagination!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By John Lyon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
