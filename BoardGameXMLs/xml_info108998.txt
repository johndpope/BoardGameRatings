			<description>Contents: 90 square cards, cardboard stands, score pad &amp;amp; pencil&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives 7 tiles. The remaining tiles form the face-down draw pile. One tile is turned face up, and the start player tries to match a tile from their hand to the face-up tile so that one edge matches. The next player then tries to match one or more edges etc. Black is a blocking colour and cannot be matched.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player manages to make a  match, the score is the sum of the printed-on values of the tile they placed plus those of the tiles that this tile now is adjacent to. Some tiles have stars, these double the value of the edge that the edge showing the star is matched with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player cannot match a tile on their turn, they draw another tile and game continues with the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once one player runs out of tiles, all other players get one more turn after which the values of their remaining tiles are deducted from their scores. Highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
