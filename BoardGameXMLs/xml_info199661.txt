			<description>Tris's writing holds special power. When they create something with their words, that thing takes on real life - it breathes, it bleeds, it exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And, of course, there are people who would take advantage of this power that Tris has: the Ones in Shining Raiment. Lately Tris has seen them around the neighborhood, in their garments that somehow make them hard to look right at. And it made Tris remember other times, years ago, when they'd noticed those Ones lurking  around...ever since Tris told their first story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This storytelling game features elements common to board games integrated into the story mechanics.  Custom cards and a board are used during play - these are provided as print-and-play components in the document.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
