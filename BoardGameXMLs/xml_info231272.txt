			<description>Managing a racing car, which is located at the bottom of the screen and can occupy three positions, it is necessary to dodge the approaching barriers. For each overcome barrier, the player is added one point. Barriers approach in three lanes, at first slowly, but gradually the pace of the game accelerates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the event of a collision with a barrier - the player is selected one of the cars. At the beginning of the game there are three. After three collisions, the game ends. When typing a player every 200, 500 and 1000 points - cars are restored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has two difficulty levels, caused respectively by the buttons &amp;quot;Game A&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Game B&amp;quot;, located in the upper right corner of the game. In game A, barriers can be aligned one by one or two in opposite rows, one touch of the control button is sufficient to overcome them. In game B, the barriers are aligned in the same way and two on the adjacent rows, for their detour a quick double click of the control button is required. Unlike other games of the &amp;quot;Electronics&amp;quot; series in the game &amp;quot;Autoslalom&amp;quot; the score goes up to 2999 points. The game can serve as a desktop clock and an alarm clock. Under the two game selection buttons is the &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot; button, with which the game switches to clock mode. To the right of these three buttons are the internal settings of the time and alarm clock settings. Unlike other games, here the mode of counting time is 24-hours. The &amp;quot;Speed&amp;quot; button sets the initial game speed (from 1 to 16), and the &amp;quot;Start&amp;quot; button starts the game. On the back of the game is a folding wire leg, allowing you to put the game on the table by analogy with the photo frame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Электроника ИМ-23&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.
