							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Las Vegas Crawl</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Adventure for Character Levels 6-8&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Xcrawl, the players are superstar athletes taking their chances in a live-on-pay-per-view death sport. It's a modern-day world with a fantasy twist, and the game is simple. The Dungeon Judge, or DJ, creates an artificial dungeon under controlled - but lethal - conditions. The players go through the dungeon and try to fulfill whatever conditions the DJ puts forth in order to win. Xcrawl is a sport and the challenges are created, but the danger is no less real. If you die, you die!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Las Vegas and Xcrawl have a long history. It's the city that loves to gamble, and Xcrawl offers plenty of angles to bet on! In this deadly crawl, DJ Outrageous Fortune gives the heroes the chance to test their mettle in a fun-loving adventure filled with Vegas spirit. Giant roulette wheels and deadly dice games are in the cards, along with a Trojan horse, an addictive T-rex in withdrawal, and a giant gorilla throwing flaming barrels. Visit the city of lights - and see if you come home alive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a stand-alone adventure that can be played with only the core d20 books! Pregenerated characters are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in cooperation with Pandahead Publishing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
