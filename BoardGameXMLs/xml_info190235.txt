			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game are defined by six Attributes:  Strength, Senses, Intelligence, Navigation, Engineering, and Science.  All Attributes start at 1 and the player can then distribute points among them at creation time.  Characters alone can do little in the game.  Instead, the focus is on the spaceship that is shared by the adventuring party.  The ship has various configurations and systems that can be improved during play.  The party is so central to the game, trumping individual characters, that the character sheet places up to four characters and their ship on a single page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is distributed as a three-page PDF; the third page is the characters-and-ship record sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
