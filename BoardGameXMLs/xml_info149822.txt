			<description>from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;In the space of one page, Nicolas managed to produce a set of rules for fantasy role playing that were both fast-playing and simple to grasp. Needless to say, I was instantly hooked. I ran a game of SotU for my gaming group, which fell in love with SotU as well. I quickly proceeded to create a little bestiary for me to use in my SotU games. It was after the creation of my bestiary that I happened upon Brian Fiscus' Spellcasters of the Unknown and Demihumans of the Unknown. After a few gaming sessions of carrying around printed-out loose leafs, I decided to gather up all those add-ons into one document which was affectionately dubbed by my group Searchers of the Unknown: Expanded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
