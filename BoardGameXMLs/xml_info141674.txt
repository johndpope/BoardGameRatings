							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">In the Hall of the Mountain King</name>
									
			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our forces made a treaty with Zon Cor, ruler of the planet Volkin. Before the treaty could go into effect, the evil Troll King kidnapped Zon Cor's daughter, Anitra, and took her to his cave kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a Private in the Space Vikings, you are sent to the planet Troldhjem (&amp;quot;home of the trolls&amp;quot;). Your assignment is to rescue Anitra and to destroy the Troll King and his underground kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To accomplish this mission, you must enter the dreaded Norwegian Circle Maze, battle the trolls, recover stolen treasures, collect the scattered parts of a bomb, and find the Hall of the Mountain King. You are to plant the assembled bomb in the Hall and escape with Anitra before the bomb goes off. Information we cannot disclose at this time will be made available to you during the course of your mission. Good luck, Private.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
