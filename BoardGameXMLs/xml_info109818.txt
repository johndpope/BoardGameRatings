			<description>Your eyes do not deceive you on the box. Yes, it is a hair-dryer in the player's hand.&lt;br/&gt;A race game played on the tabletop, between yachts. The method of propulsion is the afore-mentioned hair-dryer. The yachts are on wheels and you can make the course as easy or as hard as you choose. Getting round corners and not in eachother's way is a little tricky to say the least. First yacht over the designated finish line, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
