							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: Shikome</name>
									
			<description>From the Malifaux Tactica wiki site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These Rare spirits are very deadly. Seldom alone, often hunting in pairs, and never found it great numbers (Rare 2), they are monsters to be feared. Once they have chosen their prey, they are relentless and single-minded in agenda to slay their prey. Incredibly fast, and viciously savage, they are frequently found in the forces commanded by Kirai.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shikome are pretty straight forward. If on the board, their first priority is to kill their Prey! This can be any enemy model that is in play, and indeed a pair of Shikome may opt to hunt the same target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;(0) Hunting Partner&amp;quot; only affects friendly Beasts, but it does give them the advantage of fast, and a plus flip to hit and damage against the Shikomes prey. Within the resurrectionist faction this only applies to Rogue Necromancy, Night Terrors and another Shikome. It is worth using on another shikome with the same prey as it adds another positive modifier to the attack and damage flips.&lt;br/&gt;The bonus from the Hunting Partner will last until the closing phase.&lt;br/&gt;Don't assume that Shikome need to kill their prey. They don't necessarily want the kill - they just want their chosen victim dead (by their hand or another). If your other forces can remove the target, go for it. There won't be a penalty and by doing this your Shikome will be free to attack whomever they want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't assume Shikome must go towards their prey. While they may only be able to attack that specified model, they don't have to make it a priority (although while the victim lives the Shikome is limited in what it can do). You can choose to take a long route to get to the foe if you want, as it may be safer for the Shikome to do so (they are hardy, but not indestructible).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;(1) Stalk Prey&amp;quot; only works if you activate it prior to the Prey's activation and only occurs if they take a move action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the Shikome has killed their Prey (or have just be summoned) they can skip their turn to declare themselves hunting &amp;quot;(all) New Prey&amp;quot;. It depends on your style of play, but its usually not that recommended as giving up a turn to just say &amp;quot;I'm coming for you and only you&amp;quot; can be quite wasteful as in that same turn you could have your Shikome move to attack any model in charge range. However, this taunt can be useful - especially if you want to get rid of a target that is on the opposite side of the board (using &amp;quot;(1) Stalk Prey&amp;quot; can quickly make up for the turn you used up selecting &amp;quot;(all) New Prey&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
