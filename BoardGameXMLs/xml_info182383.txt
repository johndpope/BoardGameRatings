			<description>War game on a European map.&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a bunch of military figures (tanks, Artillery, Ships, ...)&lt;br/&gt;The map is separated in different countries with each a number of cities.&lt;br/&gt;The whole map shows lines which cross each other, each point (possible position for a figure) has 6 neighbors.&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning the players choose countries and place one of their figures on each of its cities.&lt;br/&gt;If the player has not enough figures to place one on each city he has to choose another country.&lt;br/&gt;Each type of figure has it's own &amp;quot;length of move&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;shot range&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Value of points&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;On players turn he can move each of his figures it's &amp;quot;length of move&amp;quot; and shoot on one of the opponents figures. Roll a die (5 and 6 hit). The opponent is allowed to shoot also with all of his figures which are in range, also with the hit one.&lt;br/&gt;After this all hit figures are removed.&lt;br/&gt;Then the Opponent has his turn with move and shoot and the first player may shoot back.&lt;br/&gt;After each double turn it is checked if a player has conquered a capital City. If this is the case all opponent figures are removed from this country.&lt;br/&gt;After 8 double turns there is a value of points calculated from the number of his cities. With this points new stones can be bought dependent on the &amp;quot;Value of points&amp;quot; of the different types. These can be placed on own cities.&lt;br/&gt;The same calculation is done at the end of the game. The winner is the player with the higher number.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after a predefined number of rounds or if one player has lost all his figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
