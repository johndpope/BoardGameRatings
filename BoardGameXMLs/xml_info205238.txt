							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Whack-O!</name>
									
			<description>This is a silly spin-and-move game where schoolboy players and their catapults must try to get from top of the First Form (average IQ) to bottom of the Fourth Form (Half-Witted) while collecting as many Black Marks, Detentions, and Whack-Os as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may have their catapults confiscated (and must pay 3 points worth of cards to get them back in order to finish), and be delayed by being sent to Coventry, the Tuck Shop or the San. While the first player to finish gets 5 bonus points, victory is determined by number and quality of demerits, with each Whack-O worth 3 points, each Detention 2 and each Black Mark 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on a British comedy series that according to Wikipedia ran in black-and-white from 1956-60 and later in color from 1971-72. It featured comedy writer and actor Jimmy Edwards as &amp;quot;the drunken, gambling, devious, cane-swishing headmaster who tyrannised staff and children at Chiselbury public school&amp;quot;. Series creators Frank Muir and Denis Norden are give a &amp;quot;by arrangement with&amp;quot; credit on the box cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game is undated, it features a black-and-white photo of Jimmy Edwards's face atop a cartoon body, placing it as a late 1950s publication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
