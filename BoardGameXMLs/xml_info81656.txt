			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bounches is a sports game of the future. It can be played against the computer, but is best with two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points can be earned in two ways: either by bounching the ball in one of your opponent's slots in the ceiling. The further away, the harder it is, esp. since you're attached to a wire to your side of the arena. More point are earned for the slots further away. The other way to earn point is to knock your opponent over, either by use of the ball, or by physically fighting him. The contenstants are Erik the Red and Sir Ashley Trueblood; a Viking and a knight. Matches last two halves of 1.5 minutes each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a nice title tune.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
