							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">C-13: The Thirteen Colonies</name>
									
			<description>Steam Punk? Modern Day Magic? Historical?&lt;br/&gt; C-13 is some of all of these. Technology stops around 1940 but air transit is handled by blimp. Out on the frontier a musket is more reliable than machine-tooled parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships like the Titanic ply the seas and telegraph is still a good way to send a letter. There aren't elves but there are mutations, the Tribes (half-humans), and other races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can ride a motorcycle with a .45 on your hip looking at the world through a cool set of shades. You can fight a boarding action thousands of feet above the Art-Deco Metropolis of New York City (still called New Amsterdam by many!) You can spell-duel with summoned demons or sell your soul in an illegal Atlantic City casino.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[from the Introduction]&lt;br/&gt;____________________________&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Marco describes C-13 as a magic/technological mix with steampunk sensibilities and detailed character archetypes. It is an alternate modern day earth where North America's eastern seaboard is still divided into 13 Colonies. The New World is one infused with magic.  Demon powered cars fill the streets of the gothic metropolitan cities. On the frontier half-men/half-animals make war against the colonial army (which defends itself with gattling gun-filled zeppelins and steam-driven tripod war-machines). It is a world where buildings have spirits, evil lurks in the shadows, and mankind has the power to change the universe--but perhaps not the vision.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rpg Gazette&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
