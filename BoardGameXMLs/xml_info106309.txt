			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nintendo World Championships was a video game competition held in the United States in 1990.  116 special NES game cartridges were given out to promote the competition.  90 of the cartridges are gray; these were given out to city finalists after the competition ended.  26 cartridges were gold, and were given out as prizes in a competition held in Nintendo Power magazine.  The gold cartridges are considered to be extremely valuable by some game collectors, with one cartridge selling for over $17,000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both the gray and the gold cartridges contain the same game, which consists of three challenges.  The first challenge is to collect 50 coins in the game Super Mario Bros.  The second challenge is the complete a course in the game Rad Racer.  The third challenge is to score as many points as possible in the game Tetris.  In the competition, players were given 6 minutes and 21 seconds to complete these challenges, and the player's final score was a combination of the scores in each challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
