							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: Tengu</name>
									
			<description>The legends of the Three Kingdoms say that the Tengu were men, once. Their pride in life cursed them to exist after death as demons, bound to protect the forests and mountains they once claimed to own. Hybrids of man and bird, the Tengu are incredibly swift, aggressive, and very territorial. More than one man has fallen victim to their razor talons for daring to despoil the Tengu's hunting grounds with mining, logging, or simply existing where one should not be. The sight of a Tengu is seen as presaging rebellion and war, the earth itself rising up against the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite their fearsome appearance and reputation, the Tengu are not entirely hostile. There are even rumors that they help train the Torakage, explaining the latter's swiftness and stealth. The villages that lie within a Tengu's domain have long since learned to treat the land with respect, and tradition dictates a gift is left for the Tengu at the changing of each season. In return, these people know they will be watched over as carefully as the land itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten Thunders Box Set, containing three 32mm 'heroic' scale miniatures made of high quality plastic. Will require some preparation and assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Models&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 Tengu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stat Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 Tengu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
