			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She&amp;rsquo;s a ghost, but she still looks for her lost love. If the Dark Lady sees you, she&amp;rsquo;ll make you help, maybe even send you to search the other side for her. So be warned, if you see the Dark Lady, it&amp;rsquo;s curtains for you. She&amp;rsquo;s even got her own cemetery. But, you&amp;rsquo;re brave, you say? You can handle this? Then help Jainis, an out-of-his-depth ghost buster and free the Dark Lady from her own murderous grief. There&amp;rsquo;s a Bu&amp;rsquo;Idu Ikul you can probably use. Vivian&amp;rsquo;s seen the Dark Lady and her clock is ticking. Maybe you can even save her with that ghost-eating blade. And, watch your own back - October is bringing out storms of ghosts. Even if you get this job done right, you just might have to banish a few resurrected foes of your own that got revived in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
