			<description>Designer / Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dark Citadel is a Quest for the Chronicles of Arax solo adventure game. It is a two-part Quest; the first part takes place within the Redstone Hills, while the second takes place within the Dark Citadel itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summons had come as somewhat of a surprise. To be asked to a meeting with Tarra, one of the greatest Heroes Arax had ever known, was both a privilege and a worry. A privilege because Tarra rarely spoke to anyone these days, and a worry because when she did, it was never good news.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was therefore with some nervousness that you entered the secluded hut that she called home. Tarra was now an elderly woman, wise in the ways of the world. The scars of her former life still showed on her face, and her body was now frail and a shadow of its former self.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The world needs your help,&amp;rdquo; she says matter of factly. You indicate that you are listening. &amp;ldquo;Deep within the Redstone Hills lies an ancient citadel that was once home to an elite order of soldiers. That was many years ago. Recently, a cult dedicated to the worship of Xaar, King of Demons, has taken up residence there. I have been keeping a close eye on them but, up until recently, they posed no significant threat.&amp;rdquo; She pauses to take a sip of tea before continuing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;That has changed. They have been actively summoning demons over the past month, and that needs to be stopped. Hence why I have asked you here.&amp;rdquo; You nod your understanding, declaring you will stop them - or die trying.&lt;br/&gt; This expansion requires the free Chronicles of Arax: Solo Adventure Game Core Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
