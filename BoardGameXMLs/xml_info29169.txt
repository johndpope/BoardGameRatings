							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big Chief</name>
									
			<description>Listed in American Games, #4183.  Circa 1950s, Western, Board Game. Object of game: the object of the game is to move along the game board. In some cases this requires doing it 2 or three times while trying to acquire 5 feather cards. At the beginning of the game the first 8 spaces have actual Indian sign languages and you have to learn those signs to proceed along with the game. Whoever takes 5 large feather cards wins by becoming BIG CHIEF. This game looks as if it was re-done with somewhat similar if not easier rules in the mid 1960's under the name Little Chief&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
