			<description>In the first days of the grid's construction, power maximization was key. Designers were enlisted to establish the flow of energy and information across the digital landscape.  Seeking the optimal data configurations for each cell was paramount, and soon, friendly competition arose. Who would create the greatest SYNERGY across the grid?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SYNERGY pits two to four digital designers against one another in a race to score the highest, playing to a single GRID of cards.  Gain points for matching card edges to cards already on the table.  Score extra points for making multiple matches with a single play, and earn bonuses for focusing on your own personal synergies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
