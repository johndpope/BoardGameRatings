			<description>Pf&amp;uuml;tzenk&amp;ouml;nig (King of the Puddles) uses a magnetic game board as the basis for a simple game that involves a race and puzzle aspect.The colorful board shows a track around the outside, with a large body of water in the center. Various graphics on the board are missing small square-size pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a set of the puzzle pieces and reveals one at a time. They then must get to the right spot on the path, using a simple roll-and-move mechansism, to fill out the board. When they have played all of their puzzle pieces, they can race to inner tube in the center of the lake to be declared &amp;quot;The Puddle King&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played by younger children by ignoring the puzzle aspect, and just racing to the center. It can also be played in a cooperative way, where it does not end until each player has successfully be named the Puddle King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
