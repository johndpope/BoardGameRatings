			<description>From the company that brought you the &amp;quot;How To Host A Murder&amp;quot; series comes a series of games that are geared towards 2 players.  There are 3 themes to choose from in the &amp;quot;How To Host A Romantic Evening&amp;quot; series: Tropical Paradise, Roman Holiday, and Parisian Night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box: &amp;quot;In her best-selling book, Light His Fire, author Ellen Kreidman shares the secrets of how to keep romance and excitement alive in a relationship.  Those principles were the inspiration for this unique evening of entertainment for two.  How To Host A Romantic Evening-TM is more than a game --- it is an event in which two people rediscover the excitement and attraction that may be forgotten in day-to-day routines.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the &amp;quot;Host's Guide&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Object: players move around the board by correctly answering the 'Knowledge' or 'Imagination' questions.  When a player lands on a space and answers a question correctly, they keep the card.  Five cards can be redeemed for a Light His/Her Fire Certificate of the player's choice.  The first player to collect 3 certificates wins.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, in a game like this, both players are ultimately winners!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game components:&lt;br/&gt;-1 game box&lt;br/&gt;-1 game board containing 2 &amp;quot;Start&amp;quot; spaces, 12 &amp;quot;Imagination&amp;quot; spaces, 12 &amp;quot;Knowledge&amp;quot; spaces, and 4 &amp;quot;If possible, take one card from your partner&amp;quot; spaces&lt;br/&gt;-1 &amp;quot;Host's Guide&amp;quot; containing a note from Ellen Kreidman, an introduction, a list of game contents, guides for planning the evening, setting a romantic mood, and costuming, food, drink and dessert recipes, instructions for playing the game, and 18 tips from Ellen Kreidman &amp;quot;on adding romance to your life every day&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;-1 advertisement/mail order product sheet&lt;br/&gt;-1 booklet containing 12 &amp;quot;Light His/Her Fire Certificates&amp;quot; which can be redeemed by the winners at a later date&lt;br/&gt;-1 invitation made up to look like a passport&lt;br/&gt;-1 envelope to go with the passport invitation&lt;br/&gt;-24 &amp;quot;Knowledge&amp;quot; cards&lt;br/&gt;-24 &amp;quot;Imagination&amp;quot; cards&lt;br/&gt;-1 white, six-sided die&lt;br/&gt;-1 purple glass playing stone&lt;br/&gt;-1 yellow glass playing stone&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
