							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gym, Tanning, Laundry: The Jersey Shore Role-playing game</name>
									
			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GTL: The Jersey Shore role-playing game allows you to become a Guido or a Guidette and experience life as a club-hopping twenty something who lives for nights and weekends. You might have a job, but it's no big deal. You work just enough to pay your bills and make it to the Shore for the weekend. With any luck, you're able to save up enough to spend a week or more at the Jersey Shore for the summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is more strongly controlled than many RPGs with characters actions governed by the Time Matrix, a weekly schedule of their activities. The Time Matrix is used to control character actions and to help pace the game. It also makes it possible to play the game with no gamemaster if desired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a world where appearance is king and you are who you're with!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
