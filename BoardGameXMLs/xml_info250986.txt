			<description>The last old foes of our beloved Orcs are here: the haughty Elves!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many centuries ago, Elves battled Orcs with a noble cause in their haughty minds. Their empire fell and Elves barely escaped their own extinction, unlike Orcs who were always numerous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since then, Elves went to live in their flowered, magical island. Sometimes, they come back for some mysterious reason &amp;ndash; maybe to take back some old artefact, or to save a kidnapped princess? Who knows?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are still enemies of Orcs and they won&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to kill any greenskin on their way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will finally have the pleasure to slap their arrogant faces!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, be careful, they are resistant to magic and skilled to kill you from afar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
