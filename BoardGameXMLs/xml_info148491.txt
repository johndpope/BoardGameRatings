							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster College: Lunchtime Battle</name>
									
			<description>Back to school! Here comes the annual retreat for monsters from all hierarchies to sharpen their skills after playing bad guys in a variety of board games for the past year. The most anticipated event, of course, is the legendary lunchtime battle! No one wants to be sent off on an errand to buy lunch for all the others, so brace yourself and fight for your monster's dignity!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Monster College: Lunchtime Battle, each player chooses one monster from his hand to join the &amp;quot;counting circle&amp;quot; each turn. Based on the die roll and a counting process, 1-3 unfortunate monsters are fingered to buy lunch for others (earning minus points along the way for the corresponding players) &amp;mdash; but these candidate monsters are so childish that in later turns they'll use their special abilities to bend the counting rules in their favor. In the end, the player whose collected candidate monsters show the most overall &amp;quot;hunger&amp;quot; loses the game and must go buy lunch (or whatever else they agreed to before the game) for everyone else!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;一年一度的進修日又到了，平時在各大遊戲扮演稱職壞蛋的魔物們再度回到校園，認真複習各種魔物必修技能。好不容易撐過早上的課程，魔物們最期待的午餐時間終於到了！今年究竟是哪個班級的魔物要當跑腿小弟去幫大家買便當呢？這場年度便當大戰即將揭開序幕！&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
