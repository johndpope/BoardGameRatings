							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zelda Triforce boardgame</name>
									
			<description>Back from 1992 in Japan is an era where board games aren't popular much. A board game based on the acclaimed Super Famicom title , The Legend of Zelda: Triforce of the Gods,(or A link to the Past in english), plunges you into the world of obscure board gaming. An ancient relic unknown to many non-japanese speaking Zelda fans everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not much is known about this little piece of history with no rule book opened for public eye. According to a fellow bgg translator, the back of the box vaguely claims to &amp;quot;teach you the secrets of the Super Famicom game&amp;quot;. If you play this game, you can learn how to play A Link To the Past. In Japaneses! The player(s) start at town and thru playing the game, one can find out about various items and how things work. And best of all, up to three players can play! Wow!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components used are a big mat to place cards. Cards with various enemies, tokens and tiles, a stickered die, and three poker chips as player pawns!What's different of this Zelda board game from the other two known Zelda board games so far is that it features authentic sprite art from the super famicom/Super Nes title!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;hellip; very strange.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;~Z****n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
