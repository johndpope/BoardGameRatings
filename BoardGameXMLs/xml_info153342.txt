							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lilly&#039;s Tavern</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sturdy stone tavern owned and operated by Lillian Andollina has had several names, and owners, over the years but has endured for decades near the crowded city wharf. Drawing a wide range of clientele including locals, sailors, and the occasional mercenaries; the common room is usually crowded in the evening and nearly empty during the day. Travelling minstrels and raucous card games are not uncommon. Fights are also fairly common but are usually fought with fists rather than weapons. The Tavern is known for its locally brewed honey mead and imported casks of wine. The kitchen also provides decent, if uninspired, food. For those who need a place to sleep the common room is available after hours. Private dining rooms are for rent, as is a small guest house behind the tavern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue presents a detailed map and interior descriptions for an urban tavern and the buildings nearby (including a guest house, barn, and curio shop). To facilitate use with miniatures, the map has a 1 inch grid built into the artwork. Beyond this, Zero Hour products are system independent. A description of the setting and those commonly found within is provided - ready for you to use, expand, or ignore at your leisure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product includes the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     An overview of the location and its occupants.&lt;br/&gt;     Full color, miniature-scale map broken into 11 pages for easy printing.&lt;br/&gt;     Alternate pages showing secret doors and areas unknown to the players.&lt;br/&gt;     Black and white versions of the map pages.&lt;br/&gt;     A 24x36 inch poster image at 1 inch = 5 feet scale.&lt;br/&gt;     A version of the poster map with text and spoilers removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Become a regular that Lilly's and you'll always have a place to meet new friends, begin great adventures, and return with tales to tell. When its time to play, Zero Hour cartography is ready!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
