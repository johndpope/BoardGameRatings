							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big Time Stickball</name>
									
			<description>Stickball is primarily an urban game. It's still around today, but with the advent of computer games and other distractions, it doubtless exists in fewer locations. It&amp;rsquo;s played with a wooden broomstick &amp;ndash;- minus the broom part &amp;ndash;- usually taped at one end to provide grip. Sometimes the shaft of a shovel, hoe or similar hardware-store implement is used, which makes a thicker, heavier bat. The only other item needed to play is a ball. In my youth stickball was played with many types of balls &amp;ndash;- tennis balls, &amp;ldquo;pinky&amp;rdquo; balls, &amp;ldquo;pimple&amp;rdquo; balls, &amp;ldquo;pimple-star&amp;rdquo; balls and sponge balls. Sponges lasted the longest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then there was the field, which could be anywhere. Most of the time it was a place with a wall where no one lived. A schoolyard was usually the best location, but not always. A box was chalked onto the wall representing the strike zone. If a pitch hit inside the line or on it, a strike was called. Due to his vantage point the pitcher often called balls and strikes, and arguments were common. A fly ball or liner that went different distances yielded singles, doubles, triples and home runs. There were no bases to run. Baserunners were simply tracked inside everyone&amp;rsquo;s heads. Foul territory was decided beforehand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any number of kids can play stickball, but it&amp;rsquo;s usually two or three per side. In the driveways of city blocks a white, hollow plastic ball with a hemisphere of slots was commonly used, to prevent broken windows. Neighbors still complained, though, when it rattled their windows during dinner hour. In this version balls and strikes weren&amp;rsquo;t called. You got one swing per at-bat (and could wait for &amp;quot;your&amp;quot; pitch), although it typically took two fouls to make an out. Two to four players would commonly face each other in &amp;ldquo;backyard&amp;rdquo; stickball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Big Time Stickball, two players face each other in a streamlined version of the pastime. Nine innings are played just as in baseball, with the players alternating in the roles of pitcher and batter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, the pitcher chooses one of five pitches to throw: fastball, curve, screwball, riser or sinker. Then the batter tries to anticipate what the pitch will be, and commits his swing to it. He can choose to swing normally or for the fences. A card is drawn from the game's 70 result cards, and the pitch and swing cross-checked to determine the result of the at-bat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the batter correctly anticipates the pitch he has a great chance of a hit. Conversely, if the batter looks for a riser and the pitcher throws a sinker, his chances for a hit are slim and his strikeout chances are greater. An optional rule allows the batter to &amp;quot;take&amp;quot; pitches and try for a walk. House rules are easy to implement, enabling players to customize the game as they wish. Batter up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
