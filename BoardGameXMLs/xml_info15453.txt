			<description>Travel around the United States to various destinations using a mix of car, rail, ferry, or airplane. The objective is to be the first to collect 2 of each type of destination cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Destination cards are:&lt;br/&gt;Blue - State Capitals&lt;br/&gt;Green - Natural points of interest&lt;br/&gt;Red - Historical sites&lt;br/&gt;Purple - other points of interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Event cards are labeled &amp;quot;Play Now&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Play Now or Later&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin a play selects a home city (one of Atlanta, Denver, Seattle, Los Angeles, Dallas, New York, Chicago). Draw a card for the first destination for the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn a play may chose to move by one of the following:&lt;br/&gt;Car - move using the solid dots i.e. a highway - the number of spaces on the sum of 2 dice.&lt;br/&gt;Ferry - is like a highway except over the water between 2 cities.&lt;br/&gt;Rail - move along the blue lines - 1 station for each even number on the 2 dice.&lt;br/&gt;Air - Use a spinner (which has a 40/60 chance of success) to any other airport. If your plan is not at the airport where you are, you first need to use the spinner to get the plane to you and in a later move go to the other airport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When travelling by car, rail, or ferry the player rolls a 3rd die; an even number allows you to move either you or any opponent, while an odd number you can only move yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you roll doubles when moving by car, rail, or ferry you must take an event card; Play Now cards are played immediately before you move, Play Now or Later cards can be played immediately or held onto for later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you reach your first destination - you must either return to your home base to get a new card, or you can &amp;quot;phone home&amp;quot; (remember this was the 80's) using the same airplane spinner to get a new card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
