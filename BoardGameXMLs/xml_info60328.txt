			<description>User Summary: April Fools Product&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Cover: &lt;br/&gt;A product 45 years in the making! Though most of those years were concurrent!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As BattleTech celebrates its 25th anniversary and Shadowrun celebrates its 20th, the visionaries at Catalyst Game Labs have, for the first time ever, brought these two worlds together! Join us in a universe that combines the best of two fantastic game universes in a tournament to decide who is the best warrior of all time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many warriors have fallen, and only four remain in the Best Ever Tournament: Kieren McCool, the wily immortal elf who pilots the most feared &amp;lsquo;Mech on the battlefield; Asmodeal el Angel de la Muerte, the Manei Domini blood mage who is so evil that his mere presence destroys all photons in the immediate vicinity; Nadja Daviar, a refugee from the 21st century who has lost none of her wiles or extreme sex appeal; and newcomer Jonas Hadry, a MechWarrior and battlefield commander so charismatic and beloved that it seems that possibly the deck was a little stacked in his favor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Best Ever is a bold venture that bridges two universes. Exciting, visionary, and often a bit deranged, this is the project that no one was asking for but everyone will love! Contains a summary of the new Eighth World setting, nine new character archetypes, and a roleplaying adventure that involves your characters in the excitement, glamor and sheer ludicrousness of the Best Ever Tournament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Best Ever is kind of compatible with Shadowrun, 4th edtion, and A Time of War: The BattleTech RPG, elbow grease to make fully compatible not included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;The Best Ever is an adventure for use with...um...well, mostly Shadowrun, Fourth Edition, plus some stuff from the Classic BattleTech Role Playing Game (CBT:RPG) plus a fair amount of crap that, let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, we just made up. So while we welcome you to run this and have a lot of fun doing so, some of the stuff you might need to run it successfully does not exist. Anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We recommend that, should you come to a situation where there are no rules to explain what the hell should happen next, you just make something up. As long as you say it in a firm, confident tone, most people will buy it and you&amp;rsquo;ll be fine. Seriously. That&amp;rsquo;s how we get through most of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preparing the Adventure&lt;br/&gt;Hahahahahahaha!&lt;br/&gt;Okay, seriously, you should probably review the master Eighth World sourcebook. Except it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist. So that&amp;rsquo;s a problem. So here&amp;rsquo;s what you do. Read this whole book through. Then turn down the lights at your domicile, boil some water, and make a nice mug of hot chocolate. Turn on some music that inspires thought and creativity. Breathe deeply. Then read through this chapter again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Close your eyes. Imagine your spirit slowly beginning to float outside your body. Let your spirit free as it tosses aside the shackles of the body and journeys to new dimensions you cannot imagine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep all parts of your mind open to the experience so that the full range of emotions and sensations can course through you. Make sure you maintain a clear line back to your body, though, so that when you are ready follow that line you can return to your material home. Once your spirit has settled back in your body, do not move immediately. Let it get comfortable again. Take a few sips of hot chocolate when you feel like it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
