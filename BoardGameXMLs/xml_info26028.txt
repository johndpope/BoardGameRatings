			<description>From the Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Feeeeed Meeeee is the most popular game among the Big Trolls. The rules are simple: Big Trolls sit around a table loaded with food.. but they are not allowed to eat! As time passes, they get hungrier and hungrier. The first Big Troll that can&amp;acute;t control his hunger and starts to eat the food is the loser&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must collect sets of food cards. This is done by rolling 2 dice to determine how many action points you get for the turn. With these action points you move to different storage places and collect food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Swedish edition, called Glufs Glufs, was included in issue 5/2006 of the Swedish games magazine Fenix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
