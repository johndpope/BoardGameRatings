							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bugs Bunny Race in Space Game</name>
									
			<description>Bugs Bunny is an astronaut on a mission to deliver urgently needed carrots to an orbiting space station. The object is to be the first player to deliver four carrots to their matching space station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players spin and move their pawn from their planet with up to 3 carrots of cargo at a time to the space station with the matching color. Players may move in any direction during each turn but diagonal, but they may not simply return to the square they started on. If a player lands on a space occupied by another player, the other player must take all their cargo and put it back at their home planet. They must then move back to the planet to pick up cargo again. Players do not need an exact count to enter their space station (or planet) and drop off the carrot cargo. After dropping off the cargo, they must return to their planet to pick up the remaining cargo and deliver it to the space station. First player to deliver four carrots to their space station wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
