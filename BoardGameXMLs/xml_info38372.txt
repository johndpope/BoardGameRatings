							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rapunzel</name>
									
			<description>Players race to be the first to rescue Rapunzel by climbing up her hair.  To do this, players actually climb on the side of the board to Rapunzel, who is sitting on the top.  The board depicts four of Rapunzel's braids, one for each player.  Players advance up the side of he board by drawing colored tiles that are sitting face down.  Each tile pictures the game's hero, a prince, with two different colors in the background.  The first tile for each player is placed without restrictions, one color on the bottom and the other on top, but subsequent tiles must match the color facing up on the previous tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players alternate choosing tiles from the face down pile.  If they cannot place the tile, they return it after everyone has seen it.  There are also witch tiles for use in a version of the game for older children.  If a player draws a witch, all other players are forced to discard face-down the tile at the top of stack.  The first player to rescue Rapunzel twice wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
