			<description>3 Expansions to Village in a Box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. People in a Box: introduces 10 unique Character cards, each with a unique hidden ability, to add a deep new layer of strategy and bluffing to the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Water in a Box: introduces the Water resource card and expands the tech tree to include the Great Hall, Harbor, Palace, and Mill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Player in a Box: expands the basic card game to allow an additional player to join the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the expansions with the base game, shuffle all the green-backed cards together and deal 6 to each player as usual. Separate out the Character cards and deal 1 at random to each player, face-down. Your character will have a unique ability, available for you to leverage in your inevitable climb to conquest. These abilities may grant you extra points for building farms and shepherds, or they may allow you to exchange hands with an opponent between rounds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters add depth to the game, as you explore the possibilities with each card and wrest victory from your unworthy opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All three expansions come in one box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
