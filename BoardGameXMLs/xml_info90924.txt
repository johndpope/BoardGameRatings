							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Telematons</name>
									
			<description>In the midst of a heated forest conflict, an electrical storm damages the communication equipment of the telematons, telegraph-controlled war machines, of both belligerents. As the battlefield dissolves into a frenzy of nearly unguided machines controlled in only erratic bursts, the opposing sides must salvage the situation by using balloons and ground crews to locate and regain control of strayed telematons. However, the armed telematons are unpredictable in their damaged states and the battle is by no means over, so artillery has been brought to bear as well. Victory can be attained through the recouping of lost telematons or the destruction of the enemy headquarters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A strategy game where the majority of the action revolves around 33 randomly-moving unkown units in the center of the board. Players can interact with them by learning their identities (observation balloons), firing on them (artillery) or attempting to salvage and control them by forming lines of retrieval crews, telegraph wires, and telematons. Only telematons within these lines can be controlled, and control of these units is lost through the severing of the line through hostile attack or poor tactical movements. Thre are two ways to win; either recovering 10 telematons and returning them to your headquarters or destroying the enemy's headquarters before they can reach this goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
