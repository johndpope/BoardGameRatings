			<description>HIStory is a card game intended to provide an alternative to 'secular trading card games' that has a biblical theme. It is not itself a collectible card game - two different sets of cards have been published and appear to be stand-alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The word has been sent forth! The temple artifacts have been scattered! Calling all heroes of HIStory: Bring back the Ark of the Covenant, the Table of Shewbread, the Golden Lampstand! Return the Altar of Incense, the Altar of Burnt Offering, the Bronze Laver! Restore the temple of God for the dwelling of His Shekinah Glory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective of the game&lt;br/&gt;To win the game, players (up to a max of 3 players) races to bring as many artifacts as they can back to their respective temple. However, they have to carefully choose their champions and wisely use their enhancement cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Play (Summary of game play)&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 ways to play the game. The following steps are for 2 players sharing a single pack of HIStory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preparation Round&lt;br/&gt;1) Group the cards into Champions, Enhancement &amp;amp; Artifacts&lt;br/&gt;2) Players take turns to choose your team of champions until all the champions have been picked.
