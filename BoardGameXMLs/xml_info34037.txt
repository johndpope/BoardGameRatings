			<description>Payout! is a chance-heavy board game that Jonathan Leistiko made up back in August of 2003 as an alternate use for the 1,000 Blank White Questions game board. Payout! is a &amp;ldquo;race to the end&amp;rdquo; board game. You start the game with 20 cents. There are 6 different types of spaces on the board. Each type corresponds to a vault. If you land on a vault with coins in it, you get the coins that are in the vault. If you land on a space without coins in it, you have to put coins in the vault. When you get to the end of the board, you get to sit in a vault and take all of the coins that go in it. If you have the most money at the end of the game, you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Payout! is a game for three to six players, although you can play it with two if you really want to. Payout! uses two dice, loose change, pawns, and a custom board. You can download the custom board and read the rules at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/477&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/477&lt;/a&gt;. A four-player game takes about 30 minutes to play. Payout! is appropriate for ages 7 and up, and is a great way to reinforce basic counting and money skills with younger children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
