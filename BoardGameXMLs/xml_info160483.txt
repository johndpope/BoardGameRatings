			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A push-your-luck game with a deck building mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are criminals in a prison and try to dig their way out. All players start with a deck consisting of cards with numbers 0&amp;ndash;3 (mostly 0), representing how far they've dug. Each round, players simultaneously reveal the first 3 cards of their deck, and then all players get in turn to choose to either go on digging or give up for the day. Those who give up for the day get a couple of benefits such as getting new cards for their deck and/or removing one of the cards they've revealed. Those who continue must turn over one of four guard cards, risking getting caught. If they get caught, they don't get any benefits for this round. If not caught, they get to reveal another 3 cards; rinse and repeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all have chosen to give up for the day, players put all revealed cards in any order they choose in their discard pile, and then place their discard pile face down beneath their deck, hence &amp;quot;programming&amp;quot; the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to be able to reveal 20 dig points in one and the same round wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
