							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gummy Bear Factory</name>
									
			<description>Gummy Bear Factory is a card game designed by BGG user ralpher and his wife, Saya Tsong.  Gummy Bear Factory is a Euro-style filler card game with elements inspired by great card games such as Bohnanza, Lost Cities, and Great Wall of China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from TheGamecrafter.com:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life as a worker in a Gummy Bear Factory is tough!  Not only do you have to make each gummy bear by hand, you have to watch out that your sneaky coworkers don't try to build off your labors and take credit for your work!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gummy Bear Factory is a fast-paced card game of trading and set collection for 1-5 players, playable from ages 8 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses unique cards composed of heads, middles or legs gummy bears in different colors.  On your turn, you take or trade for gummy bear parts and try to lay down complete gummy bears of three matching cards.  Players build new gummy bears or onto existing gummy bears.  The game is won by the player who created the most gummy bears and scores the most bonus points for having majority control on a row.  The game is easy to learn, but it takes strategy and cunning to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is inspired from European boardgame design.  It emphasizes easy to teach rules, no player elimination, no language, and game mechanics that emphasize strategy and paying attention to the gameplay rather than completely luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gummy Bear Factory is the only game that you can use real gummy bears in place of the included scoring winks and increase your fun!  You provide your own.  Symbols allow easy play for color blind players.  There's also a challenging solitaire variant and special two player rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
