			<description>Breakneck Blitz is a game of arena combat, in which players take the role of Blitzers (Cybernetically enhanced skaters), who are trying to outlast their opponent in a brutal skate to the death.  &lt;br/&gt;The game can be played individually or in teams, with each character and team having a unique ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breakneck Blitz is played on a square grid.  Each player draws the movement line for their Blitzer, which may vary in length and shape depending on your Blitzers ability and tactics. Movement requires forward planning in order to outmanoeuvre your opponents and achieve victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
