			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Schizoid is a highly cooperative action game.  There are two player controlled ships one red and one blue.  The red ship can destroy red enemies by colliding with them, the blue ship can destroy blue enemies. Because a player has no ability to defend themselves from opposite colored enemies both players must work closely together to defeat the enemies.&lt;br/&gt;     There are 120 levels to complete. There is a checkpoint every 7 levels, if there are no lives lost you are awarded a gold star and you do not have to play that level again. &lt;br/&gt;    Single player is called uber-schizoid and is played the same way except one player controls both ships. This can be very difficult, but all levels can be completed this way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
