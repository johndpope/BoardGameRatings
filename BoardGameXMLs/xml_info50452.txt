							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mimura: The Village of Promises</name>
									
			<description>An adventure module for Legend of the Five Rings with a variety of open-ended plot hooks for the GM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;Mimura is a small village set in the rural wastes of Rokugan. Or is it a hub village for a large trade city? Perhaps the village is the base of operations for a private Kolat War. Only your GM knows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Village of Mimura is the first book of its kind for the Legend of the Five rings RPG. A complete village with nearly 200 NPCs and over a hundred adventure hooks, Mimura can be set anywhere in Rokugan you like. It is the perfect staging ground for a new campaign, allowing GMs to quickly start playing in this fully detailed village. From culture, to habits, to NPCs, to day-to-day grind of the peasantry, this book includes everything you'll ever need to run a complete L5R campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mimura is half sourcebook, half GM advice and all adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must own a copy of the Legend of the Five Rings RPG (first or second edition) to use The Village of Mimura. The three Winter Court books, the GM's Survival Guide, Way of the Minor Clans, Way of the Wolf, and Way of the Clans series of sourcebooks are excellent additions to this supplement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A New Ronin School and New Techniques&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New Monsters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Over 100 Adventure Ideas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Over 200 NPCs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
