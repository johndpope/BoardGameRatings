			<description>Bonk 3: Bonk's Big Adventure is an action video game developed by Red Company and published for the TurboGrafx-16 and TurboDuo in 1993, in the Bonk video game series. It was released for the Wii Virtual Console in Europe on August 31, 2007 and in North America on September 3, 2007, it was also released on the Japanese PlayStation Store on January 20, 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonk 3: Bonk's Big Adventure brought the series many new play schemes, including candies that made the player shrink and grow, and cooperative multiplayer. The story is much the same to the other Bonk games, putting the player up against Evil King Drool in the Dinosaur Kingdom and many new enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonk 3 is the third Bonk game in the series, after Bonk's Adventure and Bonk's Revenge. This game is highly collective, and fetches substantial amounts of cash on auction sites. It also has a very interesting 2 player co-op mode, where two players can play cooperatively with each other on the same screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Bonk 3: Bonk's Big Adventure, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
