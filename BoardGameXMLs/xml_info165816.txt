			<description>In this turn based RPG for Windows you play as a young mercenary and travel from soul to soul to avenge your fiance and her family. While finding a way to change the flow of past events, you will encounter many obstacles and meet new allies. Will you be brave enough?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game aims to revive nostalgic moments for good old RPG fanatics (such as Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 3...). There are still a lot of retro gamers out there! We focus on getting the attention of new gamers as well by making some innovations. Our game has no game over screen; once the hero dies, his soul is sent to the underworld, to meet the Soul Giver. At this point, it is possible to re-embody a new body (therefore several choices of classes: Warrior, Assassin, Mage, Hunter ...). In addition, once a character masters a technique, it is learned permanently in the mind of the hero. It is therefore possible to transfer a warrior's ability to a magician. This leads toward interesting gameplay combinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What makes the game unique and fun to play: &lt;br/&gt;- Dark, mysterious and ever-changing storyline &lt;br/&gt;- Unique class &amp;amp; death system &lt;br/&gt;- High replay value. &lt;br/&gt;- Various treasure hunting. &lt;br/&gt;- Easy crafting system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are a fan of old good RPG games, this one is surely for YOU!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
