			<description>&amp;quot;Live and fight as a King of Hyboria!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A strategic scale game of fantasy conquest based on the setting of the Conan novels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are eight unit types that make up a player's forces: Army, Elite, Hero, Wizard, Monster, Ships,  King, Fortifications. Each unit type is rated for movement, initiative, and attack. Additional units in the game include neutral armies, gold, divinations, storms, curses, and relics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gold is gained by capturing and plundering territories. New units may be recruited from captured territories. Random events are generated each turn for Heroes and Wizards by rolling on the Heroic Actions and Wizard Magic Tables. There are also special tables for Heroic Battle Actions and Wizard Battle Spells that add flavor to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
