			<description>Fervour is a TCG under the LCG model. It is a simulation of a duel between two people in a world where people's beliefs become reality. Since emotions are the strongest feelings a person can have these are utilised to shape the environment to their favour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three main Unique mechanics in Fervour:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.    Single action turns: Just like in a real fight, initiative goes back and forth and you can guard, respond and counter. With one action per turn games are fast-paced and energetic and have multiple tactics available rather than always a single &amp;ldquo;best play&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.    Re-set every round: At the start of each round most of the cards on the field are re-shuffled and your hand is drawn again. This makes the game fast from the first turn of the game while still keeping it consistent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.    Each card is useful: Each card has an elemental ability. All cards you can&amp;rsquo;t cast can be added to cards you can to buff them. So it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you can play all your cards or only one, both hands are good in their own way. Also when casting a card the top card of your deck is flipped and its elemental ability is added and if it&amp;rsquo;s an emotion (your resources) then you play it and can use it on that turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
