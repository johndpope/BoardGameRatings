							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pyramid (Volume 3, Issue 6 - Apr 2009)</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this issue of Pyramid, the PDF magazine for roleplayers, our theme is &amp;quot;Space Colony Alpha.&amp;quot; In these 44 pages are tools, tips, and inspiration for any group of determined futurists looking to stake a claim on a distant world. Contents include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Surprises from Mother Nature&amp;quot; - four life forms that can present unique challenges for colonists. Each has GURPS stats, but is generic enough to plug into most space-faring games.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;When the Dark Eats You,&amp;quot; which offers generic information on neuroses and mental afflictions likely to trouble the first off-worlders.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;The Super Colony,&amp;quot; with ideas for how to combine colonization themes with more-than-human abilities.&lt;br/&gt;     Ready-to-print cards that allow you to make a representational map for a colony, with key features and how they relate to each other. Build it to your specifications, or &amp;quot;deal&amp;quot; out a random colony!&lt;br/&gt;     Plus articles dealing with the &amp;quot;whys and wherefores&amp;quot; of getting a colony together - why colonists travel, what means do they use to get there, how they might set up their new homes, and how the travelers' distance from the homeworld affects the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, Pyramid serves up more goodies that make a magazine fun, including odds and ends, Murphy's Rules with Greg Hyland, reviews and recommendations that fit the theme, and a &amp;quot;Last Word,&amp;quot; where we ask an industry luminary to pick a word or phrase related to the issue's theme. This month, Ken Burnside, creative force behind Ad Astra Games, gives the last word on the first colony.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
