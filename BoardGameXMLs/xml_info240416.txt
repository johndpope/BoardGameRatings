			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Shaintar, traveller. Sit down and read a while.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Shaintar's 4th anthology: Magic and Mysteries&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first part of the anthology contains the 7 Black Lantern Reports. Here you'll find out all about the Black Lantern Society, how they're structured, what it takes to become a Brother and a number of secrets are revealed. Following are several reports filed by Brothers detailing places such as magical schools and guilds, mercenary companies, Red Store, the cult of the Dragon and so much more. Each report contains new information along with stats for gear, edges, hindrances, trappings and other interesting tidbits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rest of the anthology is devoted to Magic and Cosmology, Sean Patrick Fannon's definitive guide to magic in the realm of Starfall, where Shaintar is located. In it, you'll find all kinds of magical history and learn about the Starfather, what happened to his empire and the plan that was put in play to create the covenants and save Shaintar when the spire was shattered. You'll also learn about the Paths, the Ascended tied to each path along with new trappings, blessings and how certain gifts work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book provides a great deal of background information, items, magic, trappings and much more. For Lantern Brothers, this book is a must read, giving them some choices: which spoke to belong to, rank structures, how reports are made and the history in Magic and Cosmology hints at where the Lanterns are headed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
