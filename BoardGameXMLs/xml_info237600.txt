							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Saint Rancene (of the Bough)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saint Rancene (of the Bough) is a former pagan deity converted to service of the Triune god during the Great Schism, although he is controversial for still maintaining relations with his pagan worshipers as Rancre (Ran-cree) to the point of granting them actual power. Even so, the Triune Church tolerates its so-called &amp;quot;Rancenes&amp;quot; as eccentric woodland hermits who do just enough good to merit support (or avoid formal persecution)...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
