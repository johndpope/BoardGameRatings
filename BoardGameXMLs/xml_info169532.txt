			<description>Bunny Hop is &amp;quot;a child's first alphabet game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw cards to move along a track marked with the letters of the alphabet.  When a player lands on a space, he or she must name the letter on the space.  An older player or adult determines if the player is correct.  When a player passes the starting space, he or she collects a carrot token.  The first player to circle the board twice and collect two carrot tokens wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the advanced game, each player must name the letter on the space, say a word that starts with the letter and name the letters before and after.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is made of twelve large puzzle pieces which must be assembled before play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
