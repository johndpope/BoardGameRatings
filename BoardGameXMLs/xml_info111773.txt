							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Psyche: Gamebooks Reborn</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Psyche rule book is thirty pages long, printed in colour on high quality 100 gsm paper with a comb spine. The rule book contains the rules, a sample adventure and the various game cards required for the game. The rules take up roughly half the book, the sample adventure roughly the other half whilst the cards pages are printed single sided at the end so they could be removed and used, or photocopied if you wish to preserve the book in pristine condition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sample adventure is not intended to replace an actual gamebook; it would probably take about 20 to 30 minutes to play if you did decide to however. Psyche is intended to make use of gamebooks you already own, but if you have none these are availble for mere pennies from online bookstores and auction sites. Check out the Links page for useful gamebook sites. You would also need to provide whatever materials the gamebook you are playing demands - dice, pencils, paper etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
