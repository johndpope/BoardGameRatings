			<description>&amp;quot;Grind your brain with Numbers, Colors and your own Photo Album!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Memory Puzzle brain teaser lets you play three challenging games with a single application!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numbers. Choose a matrix and a level of complexity, then memorize grid numbers within the time period you set. How many points you earn depends on how many grid values you can correctly recall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colors. A fun game for people who are good at remembering color patterns. Choose a simple or complex matrix to challenge yourself and earn points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Picture Puzzle. Start with a photo from a digital camera, or choose a picture from a built-in album. Then choose a simple or complex grid, and let the fun begin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shake the device to start the game, or press the Shake button. Based on the settings you&amp;rsquo;ve entered, a timer challenges you to memorize all the grid numbers or colors before they disappear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, the right lower corner displays a number. Your challenge: choose the correct grid location where the number should go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, with a 3 x 3 grid you have 9 choices for the right answer. Each correct answer earns you points. When time expires, you&amp;rsquo;ll automatically jump to the next level, based on your automatic level settings (e.g.,45 seconds, 30 seconds, or 15 seconds).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start Picture Puzzle, press the Picture Puzzle button. Pick a picture from an existing album or shoot camera for dynamic photo puzzle. Now the fun begins! The picture will be divided into slices, based on a matrix level you chose in the settings screen. Your challenge: bring the picture back to the original shape by maneuvering the blank slice. Picture Puzzle keeps track of your solution times, and you can post your scores to Facebook or Twitter using the built-in modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
