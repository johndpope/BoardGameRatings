			<description>Game Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the last two years, you and John have shared a tiny apartment north of campus. It didn't take long to find out that you and John were, so to speak, &amp;quot;incompatible.&amp;quot; As you couldn't find another apartment, you've been praying for release ever since, if not by death, at least by John's graduating and leaving. Because John has consistently failed Psych 1 for the last six years, it looked as if you'd be stuck with him in this hell hole for the rest of your college life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But now it looks as though you might get your reprieve. If John only *passes* tomorrow's final, scheduled at eight o'clock, you'll be home free. But John is easily distracted, and has lots of boisterous, noisy friends who like to drop in at inopportune moments. You've got to make sure John gets enough quality time to study. Tonight, the two of you will be pulling an all-nighter, burning the midnight oil, and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kissing the Buddha's Feet &lt;br/&gt;An Interactive Cramming &lt;br/&gt;Developed with TADS, the Text Adventure Development System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by Leon Lin&lt;br/&gt;IF Comp 1996: 5th place of 27 entries.&lt;br/&gt;XYZZY Awards 1996: Winner of Best Individual NPC (Evan), Best NPCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
