			<description>The infant polar bears secretly leave the polar bear camp to catch some fish, and their mother of course does not like this. Players should try to catch three fish and return to the camp without being caught by mother polar bear. The active player turns the arrow and may move as many steps accordingly over the floes, only at the back of the iceberg the bears are safe from being seen. If the mother turns and spots a bear, the bear must move three steps back. If one passes a floe with fish, one may pick up one fish from the floe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From The Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Puppies hide and seek is a fun children's game in which players carry their own little polar bear expedition glacier, and thence back to the nest. Puppies are tring to hide behind the icebergs and not to be caught by the mother who is lurking for fish. An exciting game to make her head spin around. Who will keep alert to every movement? Can mother see a bear puppy? Come on - they play hide and seek!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
