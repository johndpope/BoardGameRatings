			<description>From the original company website entry:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Japan entered the modern age in 1868, with a new young emperor determined to make his island nation a world power. After decades of steady progress, Japan began its own practice of colonialism, defeating China in 1894. As the Japanese began to infiltrate the semi-independent Kingdom of Korea, they ran into Russian agents doing the same. Despite Japanese offers to negotiate, the Russian Tsar Nicholas II was set on war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great War at Sea: 1904-1905, The Russo-Japanese War covers the naval side of this turn-of-the-century conflict, which opened with a Japanese surprise attack on the Russian Pacific Fleet&amp;rsquo;s base at Port Arthur in northern China. There are 19 scenarios, or game situations, provided, including the climactic Battle of Tsushima. There&amp;rsquo;s also a campaign game, in which players can &amp;ldquo;game&amp;rdquo; the entire naval war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Russian fleet is a mixed bag of modern battleships and ancient ironclads better suited for a museum. The Pacific Fleet that begins the game in the Far East has modern ships stationed at Port Arthur and a cruiser squadron in Vladivostok. Between them lies Korea, occupied by Japan. The Russian strategic situation is difficult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Japanese have a better fleet; though not as large, their armored cruisers outclass their Russian counterparts and their torpedo boats are more numerous and more effective. They are also better-led after the death of the Russian Admiral Makarov.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map covers the Japanese home islands and the seas around them. As with other games in the series, it&amp;rsquo;s divided into zones approximately 31 nautical miles across. Fleets attempt to locate one another on this map. When contact is made, play moves to a tactical map where ships manuever and fight. There are special overlays for Port Arthur and Chemulpo, so players can use the actual terrain of these key coastal zones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original 1999 game included:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;210 Counters&lt;br/&gt;    One 25&amp;quot;x30&amp;quot; strategic map&lt;br/&gt;    One 25&amp;quot;x25&amp;quot; tactical map&lt;br/&gt;    16 page Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;    12 page Scenario book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is being re-implemented in 2013 as Great War at Sea: Russo-Japanese War with a revised map, updated counters, new scenario book and new box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
