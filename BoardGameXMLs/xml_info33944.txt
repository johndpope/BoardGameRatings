							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Walt Disney&#039;s Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs Game</name>
									
			<description>The large 3-D accessories dominate the board as the dwarfs rush to rescue Snow White from her sleep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dwarf movement is dictated by a spinner which indicates which color to move a given dwarf to, Candyland style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No player controls any specific dwarf, but rather holds several discs with dwarf portraits on them.  During the game, these discs may be spied on and traded with other players, with players trying to jockey their favored dwarfs into position while keeping the lead dwarf in their hand of discs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the owner of the chit that matches the first dwarf to reach Snow White.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
