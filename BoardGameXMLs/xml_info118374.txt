							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Feasts for All Occasions - More Courses</name>
									
			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: The runner hands you the formal invitation to the baron's celebration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: Does the invitation say what will be served?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: Why would that matter?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: I'm hungry and was wondering if I should stop by the pub first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eating is one of the few shared experiences that everyone can relate to. We do it to commemorate holidays, mark joyous occasions such as weddings or somber occasions such as deaths. Meals are often a vital part of personal relationships and business negotiations. So much of life's important moments are attached to food that the scent or sight of food often triggers memories and a longing for days past. And what better way to celebrate than with a lavish feast? Unfortunately feasts are often glanced over in game with little description of the meal, missing the chance to conjure these images that will make the scene memorable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Never fear - your friends at Healing Fireball Publications are here to seize these missed opportunities with Two Bit Tables: Feasts For All Occasions - More Courses. This product presents a whopping 23 tables for designing that most extravagant of feasts, the formal full course meal. This product contains rules for making 7, 14, or 21 course meals. A special bonus section is also included for combining this product with last year's Two Bit Tables: Feasts for All Occasions expanding your options even further and creating a truly staggering number of unique feasts. All this and it's only 50&amp;cent;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
