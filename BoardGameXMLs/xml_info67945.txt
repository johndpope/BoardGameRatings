			<description>In this game, the player operates and develops its flock of ancient reptiles, must ensure access to water holes. Dinosaurs should be deployed on the board so as to form a herd, the young dinosaurs hatch from eggs and adults occupy more land for your cluster. Unfortunately, the ancient earth was filled with threats, most are predatory Tyrannosaurus! Once the board is moving so terrifying reptile hunts for smaller vulnerable individuals, you have to keep meeting with him. Your herd may dissipate after the attack, Tyrannosaurus, and your effort to build the herd will go for naught. Win the game the player who takes the largest number of holes and bring together the largest herd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
