			<description>F&amp;ouml;rbjuden Zon is a dystopic semi-cooperative board game, with a Stockholm setting. From the start of the game is good for the players to cooperate with the other players, but in the end of the game it is better to steal items from them. The board has four special sectors: Tunnels, Junkyard, Ark, and Mekano. You can only visit those one time in each game. The players need to pass through all of these. A player can be one of five characters in the game, who is better or worse at the four abilities (negotiate, habit, technology, and combat). The players roll two D6 and moves, draws Ruin card, one event cards and then a item card. Each item card has a &amp;quot;treasure value&amp;quot; from 1-3. If a player lose of lifepoints he is out of the game. The winner is the player that can escape &amp;quot;the zone&amp;quot;, the board, with most total value on item cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
