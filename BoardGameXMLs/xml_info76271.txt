			<description>From Official Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kudos is the life-simulation game developed by Cliffski (Positech Games, Makers of Democracy). It's a game of social relationships and choices, available on PC and Mac.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kudos is a turn based strategy game where you control someone's life. You decide where they work, who they hang out with, and what they do to relax. Do you want to be an alcoholic saxophone playing taxi driver? or maybe a reclusive but brilliant astrophysicist. Kudos is not about flashy graphics or high polygon counts. Kudos is about exploring areas of gameplay you haven't seen in mainstream games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
