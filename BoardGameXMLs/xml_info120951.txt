			<description>Rush Run Riot is played in an 8X8 board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a king (unmoveable) set in opposite corners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players also have 4 pawns which can move as rook up to 3 spaces. Players move two pawns per time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A pawn may jump a pawn of its own color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also four neutral 'bouncers' which are shared. They move as a chess king (and are moved in lieu of a pawn move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must move their pawns across the board and surround the opponent's king.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was an entry in the Thousand-Year Game Design Challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
