			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some might scoff at feelings and emotions as weaknesses and unneccesary. But your emotions are more than just weak feelings. Your emotions are magic. Raw, powerful, wild. What you feel powers and directs your mystic abilities. You also have sharp insight into the emotions of others, and on occasion manipulate those feelings. But beware, dark emotions and dark magics carry dark consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now if only the others would stop giving you are hard time about your mood swings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sorcerer is a Playbook designed for use with Dungeon World and Inverse World. As The Sorcerer, you channel your constantly shifting emotions into powerful, wild magic with unusual results. So open up your heart, get in touch with your emotions, and let the magic fly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sorcerer uses Drives and Aspects instead of Alignment and Race, an exciting new way to describe your character! This product comes with 2 versions of The Sorcerer, a Bright version and a Grim version. Each has unique drives, bonds, and emotional cores, along with a different progession of moves to express their different focuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
