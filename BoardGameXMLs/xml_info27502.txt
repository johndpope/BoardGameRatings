							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grabbage &amp; More</name>
									
			<description>Grabbage is a card game where 2 or more groups of people try to obtain 4 of a kind in a deck of cards. Once collected, the person having the winning hand secretly signals his partner to stop play by saying &amp;quot;Grabbage&amp;quot;. Cards are traded in the center of play, and scoring is based on whether you get your secret signal out without the opposing team picking up on it.  Grabbage &amp;amp; More also comes with 10 other solitaire and group card games. Grabbage &amp;amp; More comes with 3 decks of playing cards, rules on a ring, 10 scoring chips, a wipe-able scorecard and marker, and a bag to carry it all in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
