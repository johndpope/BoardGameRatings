			<description>EdLee - A Game of Self-Concept is a children's game designed to help players express positive attributes about themselves. The game is played on a Bingo like board with letters filled in on certain squares that say things like, &amp;quot;I am Loving,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I am Intelligent,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I am Delightful.&amp;quot; The group leader randomly chooses tiles with letter-number combinations that players then mark off on their card. When a player covers all the letters of their phrase, they must tell an example about how they are loving, delightful, etc. The group leader should encourage players to give very detailed examples and reinforce them with positive statements like, &amp;quot;I think you are loving because you are always kind to me.&amp;quot; All of the players can win once their card is filled in and they have told their story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game supports up to 25 players (for a classroom setting).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
