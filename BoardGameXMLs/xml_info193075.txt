							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Psionics &amp; the Mystic, Take 2</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This month, Unearthed Arcana returns to the mystic character class and the rules for psionics. Based on the playtest feedback you sent us, there are a number of changes you can expect:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The class now goes to 10th level. The core concepts had enough  support that we feel confident moving forward with them.&lt;br/&gt;     Psionics is more flexible. You have a psychic focus, which allows you to pick one discipline and gain a constant, special benefit from it. Otherwise, you can expend points to use any discipline you know.&lt;br/&gt;     Psionics now includes psionic talents, the equivalent of a spellcaster&amp;rsquo;s cantrips.&lt;br/&gt;     Psionic disciplines are now available to all mystics, regardless of mystic order. However, your order grants you a benefit for using its associated disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
