			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An indie role playing game that celebrates the Stephen King's Dark Tower Saga. It's a free 2 pages RPG. Easy to play for 4 to 6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once upon a time a great Kingdom reigned over the world, enlightening and protecting the peoples. The High King, Arthur David was seated on the throne and 100 great Knights attended him with honor. The Knights of the Kingdom sheltered the Hinges of the Universe, mystical forces that Ordered the World, but they made the mistake of substituting the magic of the Hinges with technology... The Order broke up, and now not even the sun shining is sure. But Cydonia, last shred of the past Kingdom, has not given up the resistance yet. The Blessed Virgin legitimately sits on the throne of her fathers and the last 21 Knights still lean on their knees in her presence, laying weapons down with deference. Some of the 21 gather in Fellowship to seek the Quests, hoping to restore the ancient Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
