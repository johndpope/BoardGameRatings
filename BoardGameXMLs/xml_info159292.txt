			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Need to teach a newbie how to play?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A young village shepherd has been telling a tale of an opening in the ground near where his flock roams. Timby Poster thinks he has found something of great importance. He has been telling everyone that there are stone stairs leading into the depths. He was going to investigate but his flock was set upon by vile humanoids that have been raiding the area more frequently. As Timby is prone to tell &amp;ldquo;tales&amp;rdquo; of monsters and his flock came back intact this may be a hoax thought up by the young boy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was designed for a beginning character with little RPG experience. Created for one player and one DM this allows a new player to understand basic concepts. This adventure was designed for the Filbar Campaign but is easily adaptable to any campaign and most game systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
