							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Het Symbool van Crann</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover (translated from Dutch):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mists around Dor were gray when Crann and Illis-Thrann tried to measure their powers with the dark Rothin and his legions of light-fearing allies. Great was the joy when both magicians succeeded in defeating their enemies. This was an old battle, and memories forgotten, but after many years, the name of Crann was rediscovered. This master-magician is said to have trusted his knowledge to a scroll, hidden in a secret place. When an old bounty-hunter claims to have found the grave of Crann, and subsequently disappears in mysterious circumstances, all hell breaks loose. Are the powers of Darkness looking for the Symbol of Crann? Or is all this only a fairy-tale? Our heroes will try to track down this scroll, but will they succeed in keeping it from the dark forces? The future of Dor lies in their hands ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a first adventure for Schimmen en Schaduwen, and was designed for starting players and gamesmasters. It is the task of the gamesmaster to guide his players through this adventure. We wish you many exciting evenings with 'Het Symbool van Crann'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
