			<description>In Sonic Shuffle, the player can select one of the main characters of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. The game supports one player in Story Mode and up to 4 players simultaneously in Versus Mode and the Sonic Room. Further to the simultaneous play, the game allows for players to play in teams and play against one another on a giant game board, going around and playing mini games to collect Emblems. Whoever has the most emblems at the end of each board wins. The overall goal of each board is to collect the most precioustones, out of a total of 7. There are 5 boards in total: Emerald Coast, Fire Bird, Nature Zone, Riot Train, and Fourth Dimension Space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also featured 8 playable characters, each with their own unique abilities, and 4 of which needed to be unlocked. The available characters were: Sonic, Tails, Amy, Knuckles, Super Sonic, Big the Cat, Gamma, and Chao.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game featured around 50 mini games and around 30 mini events. Mini games ranged in variety and challenge and they were divided by Teams of 2, Teams of 3 versus a Single Player and a Free-For-All. The mini events generally involved a little story, or event, and usually a choice given at the end to determine your prize or punishment. As well as having a single-player Story Mode and a two- to four-player Versus Mode, the game had a &amp;ldquo;Sonic Room&amp;rdquo; where you could play your favorite mini-games, after unlocking them, with your friends without starting a full game in a place called the &amp;quot;Toy Box&amp;quot;, as well as a stereo to play your favorte soundtracks. Both of these must be unlocked by buying Photos from the Photo Album.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sonic Shuffle,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
