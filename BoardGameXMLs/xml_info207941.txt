							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Doc Micron</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Nord was a genius. For him, science wasn't just a job or a calling - it was great fun! For earthbound scientists, there was the most fun to be had in space exploration. Nord was working on a way to molecularly compact supplies for space missions so crews could pack all the equipment and supplies they might ever need. He succeeded!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High tech labs filled with cutting edge technologies, though, were tempting targets for bad guys. After saving his new invention from criminals, Nord realized how dangerous his matter compacting technology could be in the wrong hands. He was determined to see his work used for good, however. He chose to use it, himself, and adopted the heroic guise of DOC MICRON!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
