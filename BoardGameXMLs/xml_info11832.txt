			<description>Letter dice fall into an upright stand which shows letters vertically, on four different sides at once.  Each side requires players to find a different type of word formation.  There are four rapid fire word games including: Free Spell- Find as many words as you can that have 3 letters or more. Chain Words - Write as many words as you can that begin with the last letter of the previous word. First Letter Choice - Pick a letter and find as many words as you can that begin with that letter, and Crosswords - Connect as many words as you can to form a crossword puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
