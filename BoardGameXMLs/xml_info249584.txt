			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Calling all clerics and warlocks, priests and witches, paladins and dreadknights! Your journey to power starts here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brightest Night is a mod for the Sigil System that deals with gaining and using holy and evil powers. Whether it is smiting evil doers, healing wounds, setting things on fire or controlling the minds of lesser mortals, you'll find it all in this mod.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nothing, however, is for free and the key theme of Brightest Night is that you will have to give up something in order to get and use your new powers. If you fight for the light side, then this will mean swearing an oath or a vow to do (or not do to) something to receive your power. As long as you keep this vow then you will keep your power. Break it, on the other hand, and divine wrath will soon find you. If you prefer a darker shade of morality, then you will have to sacrifice something you have to get your hands on power. It's quicker and easier than upholding a vow, but sacrifice too much and you might end up losing everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, you can always choose a little from column A and something from column B. Walk down the grey path of morality and use both types of powers to your advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since Brightest Night is a mod (or addon) for the Sigil System, you will need the Sigil System in order to use it. It is also setting-neutral so you can use it for any setting or genre that you can think of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside the mod:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    10 Holy powers and the Vows needed to keep them, as well as the Penance for breaking the Vows.&lt;br/&gt;    10 Evil powers and Offerings that need to be given up to get them.&lt;br/&gt;    Character creation sections for starting a new character as a follower of the light or the dark&lt;br/&gt;    Printable, cut-able cheat sheets for ease of use at the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
