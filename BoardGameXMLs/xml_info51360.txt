Arriving on Earth, it was difficult for the Starchildren to imagine how such a dreary planet could be the origin of the beautiful sounds they adored so.&lt;br/&gt;Undaunted, the Starchildren walk among us, dazzling humanity with thir unearthly beauty and forbidden music, joining underground bands to uplift the masses with the power of Rock. The broken-hearted and disenfranchised youth of the 2070s have found a powerful new voice in these rockers from beyond the stars. The impending revolution is sensed not only by the people, but also by their oppressors, and the Ministry of Music is beginning to crack down with lethal force. To both the fans they enthrall and the authorities they endanger, these lonely Starchildren must keep their true natures secret &amp;ndash; but the aliens did not come here to run...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
