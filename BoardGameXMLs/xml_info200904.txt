							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ga Mantse Tombs</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s offering in Filbar is FVU1 - Ga Mantse Tombs! This introductory level scenario brings a new group of players into an area formerly controlled by the Tunnmaa Dynasty. This group of rulers was rich in gold and gems before collapsing. It is well known that their kings, known as Ga Mantse, were buried in underground barrows that are well hidden and protected by traps. A few days ago a group much like your own found one of these hidden tombs and attempted to investigate. Sadly for them they were not up to the task. Can your party succeed where they failed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 5th Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for a party of first level adventurers and DM.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
