			<description>The Virus sourcebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Striking Back!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the bleak night if The Collapse, the long dark shapes of warships, scoured clean of organic life, still prowled the now-lonely space lanes and cast their deadly shadows over half a thousand worlds. Imbued with malignant intelligence, and a taste for apocalyptic violence, the vampire fleets methodically finished the work that the first wave of Virus infection had so haphazardly begun. After seventy-five years, humankind finally stood back against the edge of the abyss, only one more short step seperating them from oblivion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Passive defense is no longer enough. If humankind is to reclaim the stars, it wil have to be past the ruptured hulls and shattered computer brains of the vampires. Defeating the vampire fleets is a task  of nearly impossible scope and difficulty, but the journey of a thousand miles by an entire species begins with a single step by a small band of people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vampire Fleets is a sourcebook for Traveller. Its focus is on Virus and its continuing impact on the universe of the New Era. The actual source material is broken down into three important sections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vampire Fleets &lt;br/&gt;What motivates them, where they are encountered, their capabilities, behaviors, strengths and weakness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Planet of Promise&lt;br/&gt;A world completely controlled by Virus-infected machines, it's working starporta vital link in the chain of the vampire highway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robot Design&lt;br/&gt;Complete rules on their constructionas well as motivation and behavior of Virus-infected robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus a complete three-adventure compaign. Each adventure illustrates and draws on the material in one part of the sourcebook. Together they put players at the center of a struggle which can break the power of the Vampire Fleets forever and change the course of human history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
