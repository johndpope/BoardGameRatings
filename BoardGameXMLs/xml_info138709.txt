							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cliff Hanger (1983)</name>
									
			<description>Cliff Hanger is a laserdisc video game released by Stern Electronics in 1983. Like many laserdisc games, it is a reactive game which required the player to press a button or move the joystick in a particular direction at the proper time in order to advance the storyline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cliff Hanger used animated sequences from a pair of films featuring the character Lupin III. The game's scenes came mostly from The Castle of Cagliostro, with a couple from Mystery of Mamo. The game's plot does not come from either of the films, and instead involves &amp;quot;Cliff&amp;quot; attempting to rescue Clarissa from the evil Count Draco who wants to marry her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original version of Cliff Hanger had an animated sequence of Cliff being hanged at the gallows immediately following the animation sequence for a &amp;quot;missed&amp;quot; move. The sequence was taken from the film Mystery of Mamo. According to the instruction manual, a setting on the game circuit board allowed owners/operators the option of not playing the hanging sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cliff Hanger (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
