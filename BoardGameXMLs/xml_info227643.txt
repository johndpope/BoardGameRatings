							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guild Ball: Mason Starter Set</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Masons&amp;rsquo; play style is all about balance and subtle flexibility. They have strong but not outstanding offensive and defensive options available to them. With a good mix of buffs and debuffs forming the foundation of their combo play, they need each other to excel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are equipped to play well during all phases of the game without a definitive focus on any key area, which is why they are the most flexible of teams to play. They have the tools and the play style to adapt to every situation, as long as you can piece them together properly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mason rewards players who can see and build play to effect combos, and then take advantage of any situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nothing great was ever constructed without strong foundations. The Mason's Guild knows what is true in industry holds true on the Guild Ball pitch and their long history of success is a testament to this philosophy. Taking to the field with the finest equipment money can buy, the Masons display their wealth and influence through the impenetrable armor plates that time and again frustrate the most powerful attacks of their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The twin sisters Honour and Harmony have become a force to be reckoned with since taking the field for the Mason's Guild. Well advised by the grizzled old veteran Mallet and firm favorites with the crowds they catch unwary teams off guard with their ability to work in perfect synchronization, interrupting the flow of any opposition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set provides you with all you need to start playing the Mason's Guild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
