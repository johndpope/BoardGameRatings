			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure and Intrigue!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Old World:  Peace has broken out all across the vast Bezian Empire, and adventuring work has dried up along with it. However, in the hinterlands of the Empire, there is always work to be found . . . for those willing to get their hands a little dirty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Silver Henge:  In the northern reaches of the Bezian Empire, the Imperial Army is struggling against the Druids of the Old Faith. The Druids have made themselves a trial to the Empire. They are constantly inciting resistance amongst the locals, absorbing wealth and tribute that the Empire feels is rightfully theirs, and protecting criminals (of a political sort). Not to mention the Druids' open defiance of the True Religion, which the church abhors. The Empire has had enough, and it intends to put an end to the Druidic faith, once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This first issue of One Knight Games offers a full nights worth of fun, everything you need to run a fast, fun game with little effort and very little pep time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
