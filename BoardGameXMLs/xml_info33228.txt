			<description>A boardgame themed around Dutch author Francine Oomen's books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each players gets 4 pawns in one color. The players places the walls on the board on the spaces marked with a star. These walls block their way. The cards with questions and instructions in 3 different catergories are placed next to the board&lt;br/&gt;Each turn a player throws the die and can move either direction, but only one direction each turn and only one pawn. When a player throws a 6, that player has an extra turn. A player can pass another pawns, but not pass the walls.&lt;br/&gt;To remove a wall, a player has to land exactly on the space where wall stands. Than another player draws a card and choses a question or an instruction. If the player answers the question correctly or fullfilled the assignment, the wall is removed and placed elsewhre on the board.&lt;br/&gt;The player who finishes exactly with one of his/her pawns on the destination field wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
