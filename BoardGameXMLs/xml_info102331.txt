							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lula 3D</name>
									
			<description>Lula 3D is an adventure game where the player directly controls Lula, a pornographic actress who must recover her kidnapped female co-stars to shoot her next pornographic movie. She can be turned using the mouse and moved using the keyboard from a third person perspective, although attempting to move and turn at the same time can sometimes lead the game to crash. The player interacts with the environment by clicking on people and objects in the environment. Lula encounters puzzles throughout the game, and in order to progress through the game's storyline, the player must complete them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The solutions to the puzzles often have an adult theme; in one puzzle, Lula flashes her breasts to distract a clerk instead of using a more standardized adventure gaming device. The game does not allow the player to progress through the story until they have talked with all of the characters and clicked on all of the objects in an area. Lula is often required to perform sexual acts in order to interact with characters and advance. The viewer is sometimes required to watch sexual cut-scenes. The scenes sometimes lack detail and during one particular scene, the male genitalia is missing altogether.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Lula 3D&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
