			<description>from the publisher website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick up Aspect and start making your own legends.&lt;br/&gt;Aspect is the culmination of 24 years of roleplaying game design and piles of handwritten notebooks and adventures distilled here so you can make every fantasy character you can imagine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In these 256 pages, you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Arcane magic&lt;br/&gt;    * Divine authority&lt;br/&gt;    * Elemental control&lt;br/&gt;    * Martial prowess&lt;br/&gt;    * Supernatural pacts&lt;br/&gt;    * Custom pets and minions&lt;br/&gt;    * Artifice-making, and more&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't be a cookie-cutter character! Mix and match 40 unique power sets with nine combat roles to be as flexible or focused as you want. Choose from the 16 gentle races and their unique powers or make your own hybrids. You can even use the monster races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aspect finally eliminates the 15-minute day. Never again will your players halt halfway through a rescue mission in order to go back to town and heal-unless you meant them to. There is not a single thing in this book that can only be done once per day. Everything is at-will, even healing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encounters are easy to set up as Aspect handles Physical, Social and Mental combat, each using the same mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This edition of Aspect includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Tips for running an Aspect game&lt;br/&gt;    * Pages of magic items, rituals and skills&lt;br/&gt;    * Social interaction mechanics&lt;br/&gt;    * 70 challenging monsters&lt;br/&gt;    * Rules for making your own monsters (hint: it is just like making a character!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join the open beta playtest of Aspect and rekindle your enthusiasm for tabletop action-oriented fantasy adventures. And don't forget to join us on the forums to let your voice be heard!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
