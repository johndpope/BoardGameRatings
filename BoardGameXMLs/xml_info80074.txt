							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The X-Files Game</name>
									
			<description>The X-Files Game is an adventure game for the PlayStation video game console, PC, and Macintosh and is based on the television series The X-Files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place somewhere within the timeline of the third season of The X-Files series. The story follows a young Seattle-based FBI agent named Craig Willmore (played by Jordan Lee Williams) who is assigned by Assistant Director Walter Skinner to investigate the disappearance of agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, who were last seen in the Everett, Washington area. Agent Willmore must use his state-of-the-art spy tools: night vision goggles, a digital camera, PDA (an Apple Newton), lock picks, evidence kit, a standard issue handgun, handcuffs and badge, to follow their trail. Along the way, he is partnered with a Seattle Police Department detective named Mary Astadourian (played by Paige Witte) and a minor subplot involves a relationship developing between the two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several of the actors from the TV series reprise their roles in the game, including David Duchovny (Mulder), Gillian Anderson (Scully), Mitch Pileggi (Skinner), Steven Williams (X) and - very briefly and depending upon the outcome of the game, William B. Davis (Cigarette Smoking Man). The game is set and was filmed in Seattle. The TV series actors filmed their relatively brief appearances in the game just before entering production on the feature film. The game's plotline involves aliens taking over the bodies of humans and contains many references to the show's mytharc. During the course of the game the &amp;quot;present day&amp;quot; date of April 1996 is displayed alongside certain locations, placing this &amp;quot;episode&amp;quot; before the season three episode &amp;quot;Wetwired&amp;quot; and after &amp;quot;Avatar&amp;quot;, which take place April 27 and March 7 respectively. This time is also after the first incident with the alien black oil in the &amp;quot;Piper Maru&amp;quot; episode of Season Three.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The screenplay for X-Files The Game was written by Richard Dowdy, from a story by Chris Carter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;X Files Game&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
