			<description>Putwoody's Castle is a Fine Free Game from Cheapass Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of a 5 x 4 grid representing the castle.  Owners of the game supply their own colored stones (5 red, 8 blue, 11 white). On a player's turn he places a stone of any available color on any empty space in the castle. The player immediately scores 1 point for every stone of the same color adjacent to the placed stone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
