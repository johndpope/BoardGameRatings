							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jack and the Bean Stalk</name>
									
			<description>This is a simple chase and capture game in that the Giant is trying to catch Jack. The Giant is a large pawn shaped piece, and Jack is a small disc. There is a spinner with values of 1 to 5. There are interconnected paths with dots to mark positions along the paths.  The game board is glued to the bottom of the two piece box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Directions (from game board)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jack the small piece starts from home, the Giant from Castle. Spin in turn, each player moving as many dots as spun over any route, either forward or backward. They cannot pass ecah other on the same path. If Giant lands on dot occupied by Jack, he wins. If Jack reaches Door of Giants Castle and gets home safely, he wins (having got the hen that lays the golden egg).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
