			<description>Place your Posse Cards in front of your draw pile with the cowboy facing the opposite player.&lt;br/&gt;Pull 3 randomly drawn cards from you number cards. Next roll the die to match the cards. If the card and die match, move that number card up to the hit area, reminding you that you have secured one shot. If you match 2 cards with one roll, you receive the Jam Card. (For one turn you only have 2 cards to roll to match.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If at any time one player is ever 2 cards ahead, the opposing player &amp;quot;feels desperate&amp;quot; and takes the Quick Draw Card and goes twice for one turn. If no cards are matched, then replace any card of your choice with a randomly drawn card from the draw pile. When ever 4 cards have hit, then one Posse Card is turned so that the Grave is facing the opposite player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
