			<description>Kosmium is a space corporation handling whatever it&amp;rsquo;s needed thru the galaxy. They have just deployed 6 Space Station around the Solar System and have chosen you among other famous pilots to build the first cosmic highways in this part of the galaxy. &lt;br/&gt;  You compete against each other at navigating your ship thru the outer asteroid belt to collect minerals and then transform those into pieces of highway at the Space Stations from where you also deploy them. &lt;br/&gt;  Be careful: Kosmium is a ruthless company and to test your skills they might send you coordinates where you lose minerals, but also with each instruction card you get a special power to use when necessary. You can choose to disobey their coordinates and navigate to richer spots by bluffing, but be advised: the pilot behind you can contest your move and try to steal your minerals. &lt;br/&gt;  Be the first to complete the cosmic highway on your mission and win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
