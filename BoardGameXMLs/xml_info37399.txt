							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oil Tycoon</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the years since Col. E. A. Drake brought in his first oil well in 1859, the Discovery of Oil has made more men wealthy than any other single endeavor.  Oil, now as then, is just waiting to be discovered.  Yet, only a few men - a special breed of men - seem to solve its Mystery and find it.  What do these men possess that sets them apart from the average person?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are almost always bold and intelligent... they know Land Values and how to collect and analyze clues.  Their Business Prowess enables them to expand their oil fortune by Investing in other enterprises. They not only own vast empires, but control them with their own decisions. Indeed!  Few people qualify for the extraordinary title of &amp;quot;Oil Tycoon&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CHALLENGE&lt;br/&gt;This game offers you an opportunity to see if you have what it takes to join those elite ranks! You will receive an inheritance to start your own empire.  The oil is out there somewhere just waiting.  The rest is up to you.  With skill and a little luck, you might become the next &amp;quot;Oil Tycoon.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
