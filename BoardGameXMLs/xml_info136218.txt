			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        UNAUTHORIZED PRODUCTION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         The information that BGG has on this item indicates that San Guo Sha is an unauthorized reproduction of BANG! with just a few differences, published in China and distributed in several coutries of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;San Guo Sha: Overnight Fame 2012 is a character expansion of San Guo Sha. These are 12 new characters: 4 for Wei, 3 for Shu, 3 for Wu and 2 non-allegiance characters. No new princes or demi-gods are included (therefore there are no random cards as with the other expansions.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All cards are user-created and were submitted to Yoka Games as part of a contest on 2012 to find the most interesting new characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
