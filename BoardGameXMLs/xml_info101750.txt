							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Command &amp; Conquer: Sole Survivor</name>
									
			<description>Command &amp;amp; Conquer: Sole Survivor was a multiplayer spinoff of the original Command &amp;amp; Conquer game. It featured a deathmatch-style game in which each player controls a unit of the original Command &amp;amp; Conquer game and travels around the game arena collecting crates to increase this unit's firepower, armor, speed, attack range and reloading speed. Sole Survivor was often compared to a first-person shooter, however played with a top-down perspective of the arena. It featured no single-player mode and the multiplayer had no hints of a storyline, and was omitted from inclusion in the Command &amp;amp; Conquer: The First Decade compilation pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Command &amp;amp; Conquer: Tiberian series&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
