			<description>This is a game about politics in Germany in the second half of the 70's. The players are competing for election districts and control in the federal states of former Federal Republic of Germany. To win the game, a player has to control all districts in Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his turn, a player can play as many cards from his hand as he chooses. He can attack neighbouring election districts by playing a combination of a candidate card, a concept card and a team card. The current owner of the district has the chance to keep control by playing such a triple with a higher value or concede control to the attacker. Then the active player replaces two cards + one additional card for each federal state he controls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is largely luck-based as players are subject to luck of the draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
