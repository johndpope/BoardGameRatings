							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lady Maerwynn</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Daughter of a Prominent Family is Missing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is mischief suspected in the Guardian Woods when Lady Maerwynn, daughter of a prominent Hallendorf family, and two Southern Realm soldiers disappear while out for a horseback ride on the Greenway Road. They were last seen riding north from the town gate and didn&amp;rsquo;t return when expected. The Lady left town with the two soldiers despite warnings about possible marauder attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s up to your group of adventurers to discover what happened to Lady Maerwynn, rescue her, and return her home safely, if they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lady Maerwynn is a full-length adventure, written for the fifth edition of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular role playing game, that can be played by characters of multiple levels. The adventure plays out the classic &amp;ldquo;rescue the damsel in distress&amp;rdquo; storyline with the hint of a darker power lurking beneath the surface. Players at lower levels will have to rely on stealth and strategy to accomplish the objective, while a group of higher level players could take a more head-on approach. The adventure can be played as a follow up to our first full adventure Blackstone Tomb, or as a stand-alone module. Detailed maps and location descriptions are provided, including an updated map of the town of Hallendorf and an all new location, Castle Farnock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure takes place in a small corner of a country called the Southern Realm in a campaign setting of our own design, a continent we call Arvum. The continent is home to diverse landscapes, countries with rich histories, people of varied races and many fantastic creatures. And for those with a stout heart, it&amp;rsquo;s a place that promises to be a land of adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
