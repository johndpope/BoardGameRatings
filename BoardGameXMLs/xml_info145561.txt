							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Noah&#039;s Order</name>
									
			<description>Noah's Order is a simple indie card game. Players all have a set of ten animals that are supposed to board Noah's Ark. There are also neutral animals with no owner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players play a number of their animals face down. All animals are then revealed, and the round rule is revealed determining in which order the animals will line up. The first six animals enter the Ark, gaining points for their respective owner. The quirky scoring mechanism is that the neutral animals are scored by the player who has the most distance between his first and his last animals in the queue; hence the game is about guessing what the next sorting rule will be, combined with good planning and out-thinking the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
