			<description>There are 60 cards with ranks from 1 to 15, quantities ranging from two 1's up to six 15's; 15 of the cards are worth a point each.  All cards are dealt out.  The player receiving the 15 marked &amp;quot;star-DAH&amp;quot; begins by playing any number of 15's.  Each player in turn then either passes or plays the same amount of cards as the last set played, but with a lower rank.  When all but one players have passed, the last one to play takes all the cards played and starts a new trick with one or more cards of the same rank.  The round continues until all players are out of cards; then point cards taken are scored.  The first player to go out  begins the next round by getting the two best (i.e., lowest-numbered) cards from the last player to go out, giving any two in return; likewise, the second to go out gets the best card from the next-to-last to go out.  (With three players, the first and last to go out exchange one card.)  Play continues until one player reaches 50 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
