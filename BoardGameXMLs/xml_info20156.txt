							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Road Trip</name>
									
			<description>Roadtrip consists of 52 cards shaped lke license plates with vanity plates printed on them.  One player is designated to flash the cards to the rest of the players, who are divided into two teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A card is flashed and the first team to shout out &amp;quot;Got it!&amp;quot; has five seconds to guess the translation of the vanity plate.  If the first guess shouted is incorrect, the opposing team has five seconds to guess.  A correct guess nets 5 point-miles and no guess or an incorrect guess is worth negative 2 point-miles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team with the most point miles after all the cards are flashed wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
