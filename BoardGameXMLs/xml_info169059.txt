			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xiao Chou, first keeper of the void, was happy to arrive at the grand council meeting. It was clear that there was urgency from the message and that this was the utmost concern to the teachers of the elemental paths. Xiao was a student of the void, or force, and was taught by the current seat holder on the council, Tanaka Shu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After only a few moments of standing in the hall, the heavy oak doors on the other end opened with the inviting warmth of the inner sanctum of the council. Emerging from the entry was four of the five elders. Xiao noticed her master was missing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Xiao, it is with a heavy heart that we welcome you to the Green Jade Hall,&amp;rdquo; spoke the Elder of Fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Elemental Elders, how might I be of service to the council?&amp;rdquo; Xaio inquired with a formal fist-in-palm bow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Earth elder groaned with sadness, &amp;ldquo;Dear child of the Void, you are now the master and the ONLY keeper left alive. There is a great battle raging.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mystics follow the elemental paths. Bending them with the help of her ki to shape the element of her birth to aid those in need, or to use elemental blasts to hold back her enemies. The mystic uses her ki to perform superhuman feats of dexterity honed from her talents and techniques taught by the ancient martial traditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mystic is a base class inspired by anime and philosophy, that takes elements of ki and combines it with the forces of the elements, to present a stunning martial combatant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 19 page, bookmarked PDF contains the mystic base class designed by Alex Augunas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
