			<description>Economic game in which players play either company, bank or government. A player puts down a package of asset and debt cards - but only assets are face-up. The next player can either accept the package, add cards and pass it on, or doubt that the assets cover the debt cards. The wronged player gets permanent debts, and at the end of the game, the player with the lowest debts wins. &lt;br/&gt;Each player also has a rating that influences his/her hand cards, so the challenge is not entirely an uninformed decision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
