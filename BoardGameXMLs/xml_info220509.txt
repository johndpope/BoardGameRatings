							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Doomed Savant</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each release for Crawthorne's Catalog of Creatures for the Pathfinder RPG presents a single, new creature for your Pathfinder RPG game, as presented by the famous and retired monster hunter and adventurer, Lord Crawthorne. Each release presents game stats for the new creature, as well as three adventure ideas to help insert them into your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Doomed Savant is a tragic undead creature who died in pursuit of their obsession. Such was their expertise that they have continued to pursue it beyond death. They can even drain the living to fuel become inspired in their quest for knowledge and perfection, but don't stand in the way of their progress. Doing so can cause them to fly into a frenzied rage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
