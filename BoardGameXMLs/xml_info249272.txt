			<description>CHUCHEL is the new point&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;click adventure game from Amanita Design. Join Chuchel on his epic journey to retrieve the delicious cherry!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chuchel is a word coming from the Czech language. We use it to describe a 'ball of hair and dust'. You know, that soft kind of mess which appears in your house when you don't clean it properly. The less cleaning you do, the more chuchels you've got - that's how it works. This thing below is a prime example of chuchel found at Jakub Dvorsky's household. Magnificent, isn't it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the way, Kekel, Chuchel's pet buddy/rival, also got his name from a Czech word for 'something terribly disgusting'. Seriously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
