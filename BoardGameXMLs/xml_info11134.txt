			<description>A 49 card deck is shuffled and arranged in six rows of eight cards with the last row having a ninth card.  Players turn over two cards and if they match, the player must follow the instructions on the card.  When a match is made, the same player goes again.  If there is no match, turn the cards over and play proceeds to the next clockwise player until one card remains.  The winner is determined by the player with the most clothing on and the biggest smile on their face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
