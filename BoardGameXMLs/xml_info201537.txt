			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs wake to find themselves trapped in small wooden boxes with no light. After freeing themselves and each other, the PCs find that they are dressed in nothing more than plain tunics and brown canvas slack - all other possessions are gone. Not knowing who or where they are, the PCs are forced to trust one another to find out how they ended up buried alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the PCs search the area they are accosted by undead until they make it into the town of Fahrhandle. The villagers, suspicious of outsiders, and especially so at night, seek to drive the PCs from the town. Only Evan Soulbrighter, the village cleric is able to keep the villagers at bay. After investigating and dispatching the Undead, Evan offers the PCs refuge in his humble church.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon wakening in the morning, the PCs find that Evan has been murdered. Meanwhile, Kerith Evermore works behind the scenes to raise suspicions about the outsiders and prevents any attempts of escape by the PCs. From here, the PCs must piece together what is going on, struggling to survive against the forces which are aligning against them. Ultimately the PCs must figure out Kerith is behind their troubles, clear their name, and banish the evil from the village of Fahrhandle. If they don't, they may find that they have become unwitting accomplices in a destructive ritual of rebirth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 4th - 6th level characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
