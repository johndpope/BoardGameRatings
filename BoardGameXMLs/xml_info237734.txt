							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Pirate Hack (2nd Ed.)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Pirate Hack you can choose your background, your class and even your Race! Yes that's right Race, why is it only Humans get to be Pirates? So you can choose from the Dwarfs, Elves or Half Orc Pirates, each with their own special abilities... oh and of Course Humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Classes include Master Gunners experts in Cannon and Black Powder weapons, the Rigger who uses their balance and skill to keep the sails flapping and open those pesky treasure chests. the Surgeon who will keep you alive and keep the ship afloat, as well occasionally banish undead. And finally the Witch using the power of Voodoo to battle their foes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules also cover ship battles and boardings, has a selection of Ships you can sail and use to avoid undead Pirates, kraken and Mermaids. With a Talk like a Pirate dictionary and a glossary of Nautical Terms, The Pirate Hack has everything you need to hunt out Ghost Islands and mysterious hidden treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2nd Edition varies from the first edition primarily by the inclusion of additional artwork and improved layout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
