			<description>Think you know how many Queen songs your friend can name?  Is your throwing aim better than other people might think?  In this game, you need to make or beat the best predictions to score points and win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players receive challenges and their opponents must guess how well they will perform.  If the performing player beats the highest guess, they score points.  However, if they fail to be the highest guess, the player who guesses closest steals their points!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
