							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">FNG: Unconventional Warfare</name>
									
			<description>It's the world of the Vietnam War seen through different eyes, the eyes of the men of special units that fought a different kind of war. They conducted unorthodox operations, such as reconnaissance, sabotage, prisoner snatches, rescue of downed airmen, ambushing the enemy, and in many cases out guerrilla-ing   the guerrillas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These missions were almost always carried out on the enemy's home turf, with the odds stacked against the interlopers. FNG: Unconventional Warfare is all about these men and the deadly missions they went on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FNG: Unconventional Warfare (UW for short) UW introduces the &amp;quot;tactical role-playing&amp;quot; side of FNG. UW blends the traditional role playing game with a fast and easy combat system designed for a more personal level. Combining these two aspects allows players to enjoy the cinematic aspect of role-playing while keeping the excitement of a miniatures wargame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UW has a unique campaign system that generates your Missions and links them together in a simple yet realistic way. UW also features a character advancement system that allows you to &amp;quot;personalize&amp;quot; your troops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And like all Two Hour Wargames rules they're designed to be played with any figures you already have and in any scale! Play solo, play on the same side, or play head-to-head it&amp;amp;#65533;s up to you! So pull out those favorite figures, pop in your favorite 60's CD, and remember... JUST PLAY THE GAME!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
