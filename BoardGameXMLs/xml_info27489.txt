							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tribes of the Four Seasons</name>
									
			<description>Each player represents a tribe that is striving to have the most influence over the resources available to the various settlements of the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to have the tribe that exerts the most control over the resources of the settlements at the end of the game. The four tribes are Winter, Autumn, Summer, and Spring. Each tribe is good at using one specific type of resource, so needs to gather as much of the other 3 resources as possible. The resources are water (white snowflake), wood (orange leaf), animals (purple fish) and grain (light blue flower).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was an entry to the Mesomorph 1 Piecepack Contest, and is designed for the  piecepack four seasons expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
