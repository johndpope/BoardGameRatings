							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jim Thome&#039;s Pro Baseball Game</name>
									
			<description>The Jim Thome Pro Baseball Game is an easy-to-play, dice based game that appeals to sports fans &amp;amp;  collectors of all ages. No long rules, no long games: within a matter of minutes a game can be started, and less than a half-hour later a nine inning outing can be completed. The game comes complete with dice, pawns to indicate base runners, a scorebook &amp;amp; of course rules of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
