							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Twisted Tails</name>
									
			<description>Each player places snake pieces on the board, either continuing an existing snake, or ending one to start another. The snakes are scored once there are two ends, and the player with the majority of the pieces in that chain scores the points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has 10 snakes on it, and each snake's eye holds a special token (hole, twist, cross). These are randomly chosen and placed by all players when starting the game. A hole is impassable, but a twist allows a player to twist any snake piece on the board. This can change things considerably! The cross is an intersection that ends all snakes that touch it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twisted Tails was created by Kevin Kulp and J. Tagmire at the 2012 Global Game Jam. This year's theme was Ouroboros.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
