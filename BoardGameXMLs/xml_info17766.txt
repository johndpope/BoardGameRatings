							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Dice</name>
									
			<description>SPACE DICE is played on board showing a representation of the Solar System arranged in twelve rings each containing 12 segments - a total of 144 spaces in all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting on their birth month (on the third most inner ring) players move their three space ships through the Solar System to the Center of the Galaxy (accessed from sector 144 on the outer ring of the board) via planets, comets, major stars and constellations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is conducted based on the results of the throw of four dice with at least one double being required to launch each ship from its starting position.  Movement is a result of the combination of the four dice roles.  For example a roll of 20 (including a double) would allow a space ship to leave July (space 26) and move to Mars (space 46).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following dice rolls have the following effects:&lt;br/&gt;Throwing four of a kind (a quadruple) wins outright, even on the first throw.&lt;br/&gt;A triple, regardless of the number thrown allows a move of 36 spaces.&lt;br/&gt;A perfect sequence (1234, 2345, 3456) allows a move of 48 spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some squares contain special instructions that must be followed.  These include instructions to throw again or move to another square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On arrival at sector 144 each space ship there qualifies for three throws of the dice.  After each throw the player may pick up or leave down any dice in choosing to go for a quadruple or perfect sequence within those three throws.  Each time a quadruple or perfect sequence is thrown one ship may be placed on the space representing the Center of the Galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get all three of their ships to the Center of the Galaxy is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
