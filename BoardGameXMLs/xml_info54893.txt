							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fallout Vault City Sourcebook</name>
									
			<description>[developer's notes]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Document consists of a few parts, first is an Introduction by Intelligence Department of the Brotherhood of steel, next is the &amp;ldquo;Handbook&amp;rdquo; given to vault dwellers when they first entered the vault, it is a source on general vault life, and is suitable to any campaign where contact with a vault is incurred.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next is the History of Vault City, from the events that lead to the vault, to just after the Chosen one in Fallout 2&amp;rsquo;s visit.  Like Fallout 2, references to the actual person are limited.  If your playing an earlier campaign ignore those parts that occur some time after. &lt;br/&gt; Then the Constitution of Vault City, while some will skip over this, and I understand why, this is a great role playing resource, allowing you to understand the Structure of Vault politics, and how they operate. &lt;br/&gt; Special Characters then make an appearance, from Emerson the First First Citizen, to Lynette, the current First Citizen, and many people in between, followed by Archtypes and details on playing a citizen from any vault (with special notes for Vault City)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
