			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Necromancers Have Done It Again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Necromancer&amp;rsquo;s Almanac: 2014 is a compilation of all the material produced in 2014 for Necromancers of the Northwest&amp;rsquo;s popular article lines Best in Class, Extraordinary Feats, Obscure Arcana, and Exotic Encounters, plus a few additional extras scattered in. With over 180 pages of gaming content, it&amp;rsquo;s not hard to believe that this book was a full year in the making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Somehow, we&amp;rsquo;ve managed to pack no less than 40 combined archetypes, bloodlines, and mysteries, over 180 feats (including 26 monster feats, allowing creative GMs to really make the most of their monsters&amp;rsquo; special abilities), a whopping 152 spells, ranging from 0-level to 9th-level, and providing something for every spell list at every spell level, plus 30 brand new monsters and 10 new player races, all in one single, massive tome of exciting new content for your Pathfinder game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside, you&amp;rsquo;ll find exciting and experimental new spells, which toy with taking magic in strange and unusual directions. You&amp;rsquo;ll find a feat for just about every occasion, and dozens of in-depth archetypes for lots of exciting and evocative staples of the fantasy genre. New to our lineup this year, you&amp;rsquo;ll also find an entire menagerie of strange and terrible monsters, and no less than 10 new player character races, each with their own racial archetype and alternate favored class bonuses. With A Necromancer&amp;rsquo;s Almanac: 2014, you&amp;rsquo;ll have all the options to make exactly the character you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And what&amp;rsquo;s more, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to search through dozens of articles to find it. Everything has been collected, archived, and gathered in an organized fashion, especially in the pdf version, which not only has extensive bookmarking, but also hyperlinked tables and spell lists, making navigation a breeze.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
