			<description>The Kingdom is at the brink of civil war. Diplomats and Chancellors from different parts of the land have come to the King's court to solve the conflicts between the different opposing factions. However, among the Diplomats there is a Traitor - with chaos in his mind. If he can turn the other Diplomats at each other, or eliminate enough Chancellors, total chaos will erupt in the Kingdom, and the Traitor will be greatly rewarded...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game players are secretly assigned the roles of one Traitor the rest being Senators. Each player receives three advisers (that act like life points) and a counter is placed in the middle of a 20 or 30 (depending on # of players) diplomatic point track. The Senators win by taking the point count to 30 or eliminating the Traitor's all three advisers. The Traitor wind respectively by taking the point count to 0 or when all the advisers of a senator have been eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heart of the game lies in negotiation and bluffing. The game is played using action cards that manipulate the diplomatic point track, number of advisers in the game and the ever useful resource of gold. Much like in Werewolf, the task of the Traitor is to turn the Senators against one other while getting away with actions with which he tries to end the game in his favour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
