			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virtual Reality Role Playing Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE WAR FOR VIRTUAL REALITY HAS BEGUN&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the near future, the computer-generated environments called Virtual Reality are revolutionizing education, research, and cybernetics. When scientists applied this new technology to Jobe Smith, a simple-minded gardener that everyone called The Lawnmower Man, they gave him everything he had lacked; intelligence, knowledge, physical strength, and even psychic powers. In the process of giving Jobe an array of superhuman abilities, they destroyed his sanity. Deranged and dangerous, he transformed himself into CyberJobe&amp;trade;, an immensely powerful cybernetic creature living inside the DataNet, the world's computer network. His transformation started the War for Virtual Reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Virtual Reality War is spreading through the DataNet and around the globe. Governments, corporations and individuals are waging secret battles against each other and against CyberJobe for control of the latest Virtual Reality technologies. It is the dawn of the Cybernetic Age, and espionage, conventional weapons, and the full range of Virtual Reality abilities are the tools that will determine the outcome of the War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you can join in the fight for the control of the future. You will use Virtual Reality to learn and to acquire new abilities, to travel the DataNet, to wield psychic forces, and more. But you will find opponents with powers just as remarkable as your own, and will face the special dangers of Virtual Reality; living opponents and intelligent computers, the constant strains on your sanity, and CyberJobe himself. The risks are immense; so are the rewards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the hit film from New Line Cinema, The Lawnmower Man Virtual Reality Role-Playing Game is fully compatible with the other film-based games from.Leading Edge and includes complete rules for Virtual Reality, Psychic Powers, modern Combat, and everything else you need for the most compelling Virtual Reality game there is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included are rules for:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Character Generation and Background&lt;br/&gt;     Combat, Survival, Espionage, and Science Skills&lt;br/&gt;     Settings and Campaigns&lt;br/&gt;     Investigations&lt;br/&gt;     Personal Equipment&lt;br/&gt;     Computers and Technology&lt;br/&gt;     Individual Combat&lt;br/&gt;     Ground and Air Vehicles&lt;br/&gt;     Virtual Reality - Skills, Training, Combat and more&lt;br/&gt;     Project 5&lt;br/&gt;     CyberJobe and his Servants&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
