							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rebus</name>
									
			<description>Rebus consists of a die, 4 Scribble pads, 4 Pencils, a Master Score Pad and 501 cards that are cartoon pictures that are cryptic representations of words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players or teams compete to see who can solve the clues to the words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The clues are of varying difficulty and subsequently some words are worth more points than others. Additional points are available for spelling and defining the word correctly. The answer and its definitions are on the reverse of each card. Clues are available if the answer is not immediately forthcoming, however should clues be used this will mean less points are scored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the expiration of an agreed length of playing time, the winner is declared as being the player or team with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
