							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mobile Soldier in Action</name>
									
			<description>Mobile Soldier in Action is a table top combat game.  The game units represent large piloted mecha and is played on a hex grid.  Scale of the game is 25m per hex, and is scalable to any size hex players want based on the models or chits used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This rule set provides levels of detail that are missing from most typical miniatures games, as the focus is on individual units rather than squads of units.  Some rule details include movement allowances for ground and space combat, piloting skills and costs, build costs, multiple weapons and affects, firing arcs, fields of vision, damage tracking, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can easily be played on a typical hex grid with chits or minis, or scaled up to play with models of any size.  Existing sets like Heroscape terrain work well for miniature scale models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
