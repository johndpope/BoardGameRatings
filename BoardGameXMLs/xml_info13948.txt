			<description>Command Quality Triumphs Over Superior Numbers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most WWII rules leave you wondering how the Germans ever won a battle.  Usually they fought out-numbered and against opponents with equal or superior equipment.  So how did they ever win? The answer lays in their outstanding unit-level leadership.  Kampfgruppe Commander places leadership quality  at the forefront.  Using the game's unique and fast-paced leader activation system, German units simply fight with more options and capabilities than their opponents.  And each allied army fights differently with its unique command abilities that develop as the war progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kampfgruppe Commander recreates all aspects of grand tactical mobile warfare using a scale of company-sized, multi-stand units.  Infantry battles are as fast-playing and interesting as tank duels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's mechanics are fast and simple, yet full of historical flavor.  Small to medium sized games can be played in under two hours, or larger battles involving  whole divisions in an evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suitable for all figure scales from micro to 20mm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
