			<description>From the publisher&amp;acute;s website:&lt;br/&gt;Professor Bugsy loves bugs. To be able to observe them he wants to catch as many of them as possible. But what bug would want to get into his matchbox? Life is much better outside the box! The bugs are on holiday right now. They&amp;rsquo;re relaxing and swimming in their summer houses. When the fun ends, sadly they have to go home. The road is dangerous, because the professor is lurking on the path leading to the city&amp;hellip; How many bugs will get home to Bugsville?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll the dice. First die shows the bugs who left the town or being catched by professor or escaped from the matchbox. But if magnifying glass is rolled the matchbox moves as many steps further than the other die shows to catch all the bugs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players lost the game if 4 or more bugs are catched and there are no bugs left at the summer house. Otherwise players win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
