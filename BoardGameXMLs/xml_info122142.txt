			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An arcade adventure game themed after the 1980s cartoon show. VENOM has captured M.A.S.K. agents and scattered them through time and space. Matt Trakker must find his missing teammates in four different levels. On each level, he must first collect pieces of a key necessary to activate a scanner. Once the scanner is activated it shows the direction of the next team member's location. Once the team member is picked up, his mask can be picked up too. Each level (except the first) has two agents to rescue. The back of the box says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Join with the forces of MASK, skilfully commanded by the brilliant strategist Matt Trakker and combat the evil of the villainous VENOM in their quest for domination of the world. No longer need you stand by and passively observe the evil deeds of Mayhem and his co-conspirators. Here is your chance to dig dep into your cunning and put your skills to the test against possibly the greatest criminal the world has ever seen, fact or fiction.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
