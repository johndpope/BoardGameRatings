			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new Dust Tactics: Axis Hero Pack allows players to guide their Axis Zombie units with one (or both) of two new Heroes with the Blutkreuz Zombie skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shrugging off small arms fire with his Damage Resilient skill, Grenadier X flings himself into Close combat with his circular saw where he cuts into troops and walkers indiscriminately. Any Allied forces that don't fall to Grenadier X and any zombie squad he joins may find themselves concerned by the sinister presence of TotenMeister. Not only did this Blutkreuz Korps experiment manage to cheat death and become both Damage Resilient and ferociously strong, but her supply of Wiederbelebungsserum allows her to recover from nearly any wound. With their unholy strength, these Heroes lend resilience to any Axis army, with or without squads of Axis Zombies to join them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the Axis Hero Pack introduces Stefan, a deadly Oberleutnant who uses some of the Allies' most effective tricks against them, literally fighting fire with fire with his Flammenwerfer 40.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
