			<description>The aim of the game: find the colour of an object as quickly as possible to collect the card. But beware of QUICKLY the dog who likes to disrupt the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game preparation: place the five &amp;quot;coloured spot&amp;quot; cards colour side up in the centre of the players. Shuffle the other cards and lay them face down in a draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play: Turn over the first card in the draw pile and lay it on the table. Turn over a second card and lay it next to the first. On the second card, look at the object in the white circle. What colour is this object on the first card? The game continues with the second card serving as the first card, and a new card is turned over from the draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end of play: the game ends when the draw pile is empty. The player with the most cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
