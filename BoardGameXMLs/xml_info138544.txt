			<description>Join the party with this tongue in cheek card game. Impress the ladies with crazy dances, exotic drinks and cheesy pick-up lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw five &amp;quot;move&amp;quot; cards, a mixture of pick-up lines, dances, name-drops and outfits and cock-block cards.  Then, players choose a location in the club to &amp;quot;make their move&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Locations include:&lt;br/&gt;The Bar - players may exchange &amp;quot;move&amp;quot; cards for drink cards and play drink cards as well as other move cards.&lt;br/&gt;The Dance Floor - players get a bonus to &amp;quot;dance moves&amp;quot; but cannot play name-drops or pick-up lines.&lt;br/&gt;The VIP - players exchange a move card for entry, but receive a bonus for name drop cards. All other move cards can be played.&lt;br/&gt;The Balcony - players get bonuses to pick-up lines and can play all other move types except dance moves.&lt;br/&gt;The Bathroom - players can draw back up to 5 move cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who makes the best move, as scored by the total point value of all move cards made that round, impresses the lady that round. The next round, a new lady is eligible to impress, and the game continues until the lady total equals the winning total as determined by the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
