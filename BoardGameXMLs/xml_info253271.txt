			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;FK&amp;amp;P is a set of straightforward wargaming rules that has been designed to give novices an entertaining introduction to the mid-17th Century whilst also providing grognard wargamers with a challenging evening&amp;rsquo;s play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules address warfare in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland during the period from 1639 to 1651 known as the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, or sometimes as the British or English Civil Wars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A square grid has been used to promote speed of play.  This also enables figures which have been based on different frontages, for use with a variety of rule systems, to be used together. The rules are simple enough that players who have not previously encountered them &amp;ndash; including wargaming novices of any age &amp;ndash; can be taught the basics in  fteen minutes or so and then learn the rest &amp;ldquo;on the job&amp;rdquo;. &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
