							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Narrative Encounters: Bearwood Forest</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a Bear Mauls Adventurers in the Woods, is Anyone Around to Hear the Sound?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Random encounters can be a very controversial topic. For some, the phrase is like a dirty word, evoking frustrating slogs through meaningless and flavorless encounters that do nothing but stall the game and bore everyone to tears. For others, it evokes a sense of yearning for the good old days, has the potential to lead the party in directions they might not otherwise go, lets the GM use monsters she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t ordinarily, and makes the game world feel more alive and dangerous. If only there could be a way to take all the good elements of random encounters, while still keeping all the flavor and purpose of scripted encounters that serve as a part of a larger narrative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Narrative Encounters: Bearwood Forest, and other Narrative Encounters products, attempts to settle the age-old debate by presenting a hybrid way of handling encounters. Each Narrative Encounters product contains a number of specific encounters, complete with stat-blocks, which tie into a single, larger narrative about the location in question. As the PCs adventure throughout an area, the specific encounters they have are randomized, but they still come together to paint a larger picture, creating a cohesive and realistic sense of atmosphere and ecosystem, and unfolding a story not unlike that of a standard adventure. Narrative Encounters products are intended to serve as background material while the PCs pursue the &amp;ldquo;main&amp;rdquo; adventure in an area, but can easily be made to serve as a mapless, free-form adventure all their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Narrative Encounters: Bearwood Forest is intended for a group of 4-5 adventurers of 5th &amp;ndash; 7th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
