			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The desert wastes of Dominion territory are steeped in powerful magic.  All manner of unusual phenomena manifest themselves across the windswept dunes &amp;ndash; magical vortexes, alien entities, and the remnants of partially dispelled enchantments render the already stark realities of the desert even more daunting.  Most noteworthy of all are the natural denizens of the sands.  Some of these are dangerous, terrible entities whose only goal is to flay the life from any who cross their paths.  Others are passive, or even friendly to the civilized peoples who settled the region.  The most powerful of all the beings of the desert are the mighty Genii &amp;ndash; elemental nobility.  The magically powerful sorcerers of the Dominion discovered methods and rites to imprison, control, and even engineer many of the entities that inhabit their homeland.  Informed by the ancient technology of the Kaga, the sorcerers blended artifice and the Art to create a new breed of Arcane Intelligences, one born of the native genii of the desert sands.
