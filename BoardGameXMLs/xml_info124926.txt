			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While it is true that many soulknives manifest their powers through anger, frustration or a sheer need for violence, there are those who manifest instead an inner need for law and justice. For some, the mind blade is the physical manifestation of the law, the truth, and the purity of the manifester.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Purity of mind, body and soul are the halmarks of paladins and of these soulknives. Through force of will, they manifest this purity as a plane of psionic energy that can cut as sharply as any knife blade, and wound as deep as a sword.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TrueBlades are those who have heard the calling of a good deity of law and who have found the power within themselves to manifest this calling in physical form, without need of sword nor forge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
