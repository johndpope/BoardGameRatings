							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Valley of the Witch</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Valley of the Witch is a Quest for the Chronicles of Arax solo adventure game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Snow is not an uncommon sight in northern Arax. The winters are cold, and snow is often an inch or so thick on the ground. The further north one goes, the worse the snow usually is. However, snow in the middle of summer is unheard of. Until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have been spending some time in the town of Gaxdon. The summer heat has been intense this year and you have spent the time in alehouses and bathing in the cool water of the ocean. But all that changed when a sudden cold snap hit. Snow began to fall on the streets and people looked to the skies in confusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sudden weather probably would have been dismissed as a freak occurrence, except that the bitter cold continued. Snow lay thickly on the cobblestone streets and many began to die from the intense cold. Something wasn&amp;rsquo;t right; that you were certain of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After some asking around you learn of a witch who lives in a valley in the northern mountains. She is said to be quite powerful, and one who has powers of nature. The more you ask about her, the more you become certain that she could be the one responsible for the cold snap. You also discover that the valley she lives in is home to the gnomes, evil dwarfs who turned to the worship of dark powers centuries ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You decide to investigate. You will need to be careful, but if nothing is done soon the bitter cold is going to not only wreak havoc but also claim many lives.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
