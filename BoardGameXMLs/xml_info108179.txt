							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Last Ghost Hunt</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So You Want To Hunt Ghosts?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Reality Television packed media of the Earth in the year 2015, there are a lot of opportunities for some enterprising young people to make money. The supernatural investigation show can be very appealing for those who like to travel and shout at ghosts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one is better at this than the Ghost Annoyers, and they only need to get one more show out this season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, in the world of Hot Chicks, the ghosts might just be more real than you want to deal with. Follow the story of the Ghost Annoyers' worst night ever as they finally find what they've been looking for all along... and it finds them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even if they survive the attention of these ancient evil sadists, they might just be releasing one of the most gruesome terrors to ever be imprisoned within the Earth... or they might just be hastening the destruction of the very Earth itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
