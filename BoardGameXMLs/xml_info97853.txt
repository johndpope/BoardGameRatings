			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;Simple 20 is a generic game system inspired by d20 and BRP.  It is simple in design, uses minimal rules and is easily adapted to any genre of gaming with a minimum of effort (depending on the level of detail desired).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules are the evolutionary descendant of James Hargrove's earlier Core Elements[/rpg].  These rules seem a little tighter and more distilled than in Core Elements[/rpg].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;designer's notes from rules postscript&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;This set of rules was inspired by several pre-existing works, including the World's Most Popular Roleplaying Game (now in its third edition), the World's Most Popular Percentile-Based Roleplaying Game (recently released under the OGL), Core Elements, and Scott Lininger's The Window (no kidding).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
