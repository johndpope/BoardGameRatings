			<description>The players are astronauts trying to find out and get as many super-crystals from Super-crystals galaxy as possible. They start from their space stations and and travel through the stars following the number obtained on the dice (from 2 to 6). Additionally, a space shuttle travels into the galaxy and it is moved every time the dice shows its figure (corresponding to number 1). When a player lands on a star containing a chip he must turn it out: if the chip shows a super-crystal the player take it. The players should bring as many crystals as possible back to their space stations before the space shuttle reach the galaxy. However, the chip can show no crystal but a monster, a crystal-breaker. In this case, the astronaut rolls the dice to fight against the monster, which power corresponds to the number of its teeth. If the player wins, he captures the crystal-breaker and can bring it to his station as his prisoner. If the monster wins, all crystals owned by the player and still not safe in his station are put on this field and become property of the monster. These crystals can be recovered by a player who defeat the monster in another battle. The game ends when the spaceship arrives at the galaxy and the winner is the player who has the majority of the points given by the values of crystals and the amount of monster teeth he has brought to his start station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
