			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes the snow will not stop. Under its particled screen like layers of veil that would make of the world a bride to an unknown, vast and unseen groom all civilization is wondering from its hearths and stone corners: What is to be done about the women? They spit and rage, they drown the taxmen, they hack the bellies of snakes and eat what they find, they abort babies and squeeze their milk into the bellies of troll-cats, they dwell apart among the wide white peaks, raiding, scheming, speaking to animals, willful and without trade or diplomatic discourse&amp;mdash;the witch-women and amazons. They dominate and divide the Devoured Land. Who can see this ending well?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the multi-award winning artist/writer behind Vornheim: The Complete City Kit, Red &amp;amp; Pleasant Land, and Maze of the Blue Medusa, this book details the bleak white wild created on the spot where the first goddess took the first bite out of the Earth, which maintains the balances and arrangements that held sway in the first days. It contains wolfpacks, cannibal giants, trolls, demons of the apocalypse as well as a wilderness kit with enough tables, generators and tools to keep your players busy until hell freezes over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frostbitten &amp;amp; Mutilated is a setting book for use with Lamentations of the Flame Princess Weird Fantasy Role-Playing and other traditional role-playing games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
