			<description>V&amp;icirc;ro is inspired by ideas in microbiology. In this asymmetric strategy game, one player plays as the invasive virus while the other player plays as the defending immune system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players alternate turns moving pieces across a hexagon grid. When pieces collide, they cancel each other out and are both removed from the board in an even exchange. The virus has the added ability of multiplying (adding additional pieces to the board) and the immune system is able to place &amp;ldquo;immunoboosters&amp;rdquo; which destroy any piece they fall on and change the playable area of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the virus is to complete the infection by getting a single point to a certain point on the opposite end of the board. Blue wins if it effectively eliminates the virus from the board or permanently blocks the virus from reaching its goal point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
