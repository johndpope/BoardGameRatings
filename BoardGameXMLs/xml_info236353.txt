			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it unless given direct written permission from the publisher which must be noted in the image caption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you are braving scalding flames to save victims trapped in a raging inferno, or fleeing from the devastation wrought by a dragon, Pathfinder Flip-Mat: Forest Fire has you covered. The two-sides of this Flip-Mat detail two different forest fires, one in a rocky maze on a mountainside and another around a secluded forest outpost. Don't waste your time sketching when you could be playing. With Pathfinder Flip-Mat: Forest Fire, you'll be ready next time things get a little too heated in the woods!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
