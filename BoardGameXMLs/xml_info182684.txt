			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gypsy Knights Games is proud to present the ninth entry in our newest line of products dedicated to the starships of Clement Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships of Clement Sector 9: System Defense Boats details six common vessels that are often the first line of defense for a planetary government and, for many, the only system defense they have against piracy or even invasion from another planetary government.  These boats can be used as a primary defense, customs inspections or search and rescue missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships of Clement Sector 9: System Defense Boats comes complete with beautiful views of each of these ships.  Each ship is shown with full deckplans and statistics to make your use of our product simple, easy, and fun.  In addition, we have included several adventure seeds and a sample NPC to aid the Referee in his/her preparation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though designed specifically with our Clement Sector setting in mind, each of these ships could easily be used in any Traveller setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
