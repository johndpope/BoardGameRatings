			<description>AlphaNatix (sounds just like Al-Fanatics) launches Zero Entertainment's line of Action-Word games. Wind your way around around wicked word challenges. Rack up letters, avoid hazards and race to complete your word list before time runs out. Once you've a completed puzzle, go back and try to beat your own score. Why? Because AlphaNatix tracks your best scores and allows you see how you fare against players worldwide!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Urban Legends Edition is our first collection of perplexing puzzles all wrapped up in the crazy mythos of this brave new world in which we live. Have you heard about the pet dog that was really a sewer rat? Have you been warned about kidney thieves? Did you get the $650 cookie recipe? This Edition has 30 of your favorites--and every single one of them is true!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
