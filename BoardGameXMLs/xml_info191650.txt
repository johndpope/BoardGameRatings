			<description>The years&amp;rsquo; 1965 and you&amp;rsquo;ve just gotten a job in one of those brand new &amp;ldquo;Data Centers&amp;rdquo;. Your job is to feed endless piles of punch cards into different computers and tally the results. Problem is, you kinda all overstated your experience with these machines and you don&amp;rsquo;t really know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing.&lt;br/&gt;You and your colleagues will feed the computers with punch cards and hope that everything goes well and that no computers jam and overheat!&lt;br/&gt;Who knows, maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll get to be the supervisor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players get number cards.&lt;br/&gt;With these cards, they need to combine these to form equations (addition, subtractions, divisions) or to form whole numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then they get to enter these values in one of the computers, in various bases (base 2, base 3, prime numbers, tec...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each values that match. the player puts one of his cubes in the column, to gain majority and points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points wins and becomes the supervisor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
