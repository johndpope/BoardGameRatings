							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Would You Rather? DVD Game</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Would you rather your hostage negotiator be Ozzy Osbourne or Jessica Simpson? It's your choice when you play Would You Rather? the DVD board game packed with deranged dilemmas, difficult choices and a lot of laughing. Players take turns answering absurd and randomly-drawn questions from the DVD. Selecting an answer on their voting card, it's up to all the other players to try and correctly predict which answer they think the player selected. Based on the best-selling Would You Rather Books, this DVD game is sure to break the ice at any party....and keep that party going for hours! For 2 or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
