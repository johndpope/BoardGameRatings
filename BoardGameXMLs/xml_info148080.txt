							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shanty Town</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 48 x 30 inch Floor Plan of a Shanty Town, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play. The map suits Modern rpg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well it ain&amp;rsquo;t much, but its our home.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product is a shantytown built on sandy, dirty, and rocky surface. A wooden fence surrounds the town with gaps in the western, eastern, and southern walls. The houses in the town are made of various pieces of sheet metal, wood, and even cloth tarps or tires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product is intended for use in modern or post-apocalyptic settings. It can also be used in near or far-future science fiction settings as a slum in a poor city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The people in the shantytown aren&amp;rsquo;t paying for their power. The local utility sends workers in to disconnect them, but a local gang that fires warning gunshots scares them off. The city sends the group in to deal with the gang as either police officers or independent bounty hunters. The local gang protects the shantytown, but isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily looking for a true confrontation and may be willing to negotiate before a fight. The rickety nature of the shantytown makes it a dangerous place for combat. Stray bullets can hit building beam supports and bring whole buildings down. Most cover is also soft with buildings having many boards missing giving half-cover at best. It is up to the group to negotiate with or defeat the local gang and stop the power drainage on the city&amp;rsquo;s power grids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
