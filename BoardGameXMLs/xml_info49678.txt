			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;In the agonizing aftermath of the Greyhawk wars, when conflict touched virtually every corner of the continent, few gained more infamy than Rary of the Circle of Eight. Once considered a quiet, peaceful man with few ambitions, the great mage instead was corrupted to the ways of evil, and in the process slew two of the wisest and most powerful wizards of the Flanaess. Now, fleeing south with his co-conspirator and their loyal troops, he has carved out an empire in the wilderness, and threatens to inflict more harm and chaos on a world long grown weary of war and strife.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus begins this supplement for the GREYHAWK campaign setting, the first since the world-shattering GREYHAWK Wars boxed game. Descriptions of Rary's desert fortress in the Brass Hills are here, as are statistics on his co-conspirator, Lord Robilar. The back-breaking mines of Abbor Alz, home to the duergar, and the Ghost Tower of Inverness are detailed as well, along with dozens of other places, things, and persons. A four-color poster map of the Bright Desert and its surroundings is also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not necessary to have played the GREYHAWK Wars boxed game in order to use this material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The campaign material contained in this booklet is suitable for players and referees of all levels; the adventures, however, are aimed at characters of levels 8 and up.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
