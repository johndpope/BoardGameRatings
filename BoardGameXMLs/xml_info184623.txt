							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Prefab Encounter: The Ronin</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ronin, a beaten an better figure seen wandering the wilds. He had recently been attacked by a gand of bandits who had robbed him of his only momento to his late master - a golden wax seal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While he is happy to request assistance from a group of passing travellers, one might begin to wonder if he is beginning to judge the party's actions... and if there are concquences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ronin is a fantastic encounter for a DM to challenge the morality of a low level party while also encouraging a little Role Play or backstory development  from the more timid players by utilising the NPC&amp;rsquo;s morality system. It can be also used by a DM to punish particularly chaotic players without them feeling like they are being singled. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
