							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Triangle Maker</name>
									
			<description>Triangle Maker is an abstract strategy game in which two to four players compete by forming triangles.  Players use the thirteen pieces to make triangles to score points.  This educational board game is a fun way to hone players&amp;rsquo; creativity, spatial awareness, critical thinking, and concentration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two movable pieces are the game changers of Triangle Maker.  Clever use of these pieces can tip the balance to your side and name you the ultimate victor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to make the most and/or biggest triangles with the pieces available to earn the most points.  Every newly formed triangle adds to your score.  However, there is one rule:  You cannot place pieces where the same colored lines overlap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four different ways to play Triangle Maker:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Card Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a. Shuffle the cards&lt;br/&gt;b. When it is your turn, draw the first card and place the corresponding piece onto the board. (Earn tokens based on the number or size of the triangle&lt;samp&gt; made)&lt;br/&gt;c. You can use either of the movable pieces during your turn instead of drawing your next card.&lt;br/&gt;d. Whoever gets the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Strategy Card Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a. Shuffle the cards and draw two cards.&lt;br/&gt;b. When it is your turn, use one of the pieces on the drawn cards and place it onto the board. (Earn tokens based on the number or size of the triangle&lt;samp&gt; made)&lt;br/&gt;c. During the next turns, remember to draw a card to replace the one used and then repeat the above step.&lt;br/&gt;d. Whoever gets the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. No-Card Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a. When it is your turn, place any piece onto the board.  (Earn tokens based on the number or size of the triangle&lt;samp&gt; made)&lt;br/&gt;b. Whoever, gets the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Obstruction Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a. While keeping only the movable pieces, transfer all your pieces to another player.&lt;br/&gt;b. When it is your turn, the other player will choose the piece he/she wants you to place onto the board.  (Earn tokens based on the number or size of the triangle&lt;samp&gt; made)&lt;br/&gt;c. When it is the other player&amp;rsquo;s turn, select the piece that would be most disadvantageous for him/her.&lt;br/&gt;d. You can use either of the movable pieces during your turn instead of accepting the other player&amp;rsquo;s pieces.&lt;br/&gt;e. Whoever gets the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Small triangle is worth 1 point each.&lt;br/&gt;2. Large triangle is worth 4 points each.&lt;br/&gt;3. Giant triangle is worth 9 points each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    It is possible to earn more points by forming multiple triangles in one turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
