			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While in a tavern in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate, the PCs overhear two men talking and laughing. The topic of conversation is an old orc who calls himself the Marquis de Dorvaire. Obviously, this orc has gone quite mad in his old age. The two men are telling stories of when Dorvaire and two of his henchmen came to Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate. Between laughter, the men tell of the mad orc being dressed in tattered red robes, ordering people about as he made his way through the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the men claims to have been in the street haggling with a jewelry vendor when the old orc bumped into him. Turning around, the man became frightened as he spotted the large orc and his two henchmen. According to the man, the &amp;ldquo;Marquis&amp;rdquo; reached out, tapped him on the chest with two large fingers, and told him he was pardoned for his crimes and may go on his way. Still laughing, the man tells his friend that the old orc&amp;rsquo;s two henchmen both hung their heads and rolled their eyes as the Marquis flung his tattered robe back, held his head high, and walked on down the street. Laughing loudly, the man tells his friend that the two henchmen both apologized to him, and requested him to not call the guards, as the orc is very old and harmless, and they will leave the city as soon as they purchase some supplies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
