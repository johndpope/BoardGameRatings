			<description>Who am I? An animal? Something with wheels? Guess quickly and win. Each of the 120 cards shows a picture - e.g. a monkey, a pirate, a birthday cake, a car, and so on. One player, the 'leader' for the round, draws a card from the deck without showing it. In turn the other players ask the card holder a question that has a 'Yes' or 'No' answer. After asking a question a player can guess the object, or choose not to try and guess. If he guesses and is right he wins the card but if he is wrong he has to give back an already won card. The player who guesses correctly then becomes the leader for the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first to correctly win four cards (or any other number of cards as agreed by the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains 120 cards in a bus shaped-box. A great game for a road trip!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
