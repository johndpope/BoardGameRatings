			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We had a rather curious accident today, Rufus fell down. While that in of itself is not that uncommon as the poor fellow seems to have a knack for poor agility and an equal form of luck, what is odd is the manner in which he fell. He was drawn to the ground, pulled by an unseen force, and there he remained, unable to stand until removed of his backpack, which remained held steadfast to the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
