							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Nightmare Invader</name>
									
			<description>In The Nightmare Invader you play as an ordinary hotel guest with an extraordinary ability - you can enter other people's dreams.  You will need that power to fight The Nightmare Invader - an evil entity who is trying to take control of all the guests by giving them terrifying nightmares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game, first you must wake up as many guests as you can before the invader drives them insane with terror.  Then you will take the fight to the invader, trying to drive it out of the mind of its human host, or destroying it completely.  But it will not be easy.  The invader is completely alien, and uses deckbuilding to achieve its goals.  Meanwhile you must use six sided dice to achieve yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Invader gets the first turn.  On the Invader turn you draw 3 cards from the Invader deck, each showing a different fear, such as Ghosts or Spiders.  Any guests afraid of these fears become panicked.  If the Invader can panic a guest 5 times before you wake them, they succumb to the will of the Invader and their card is added to the Invader deck, making it stronger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you roll 6 dice.  Each die can be used once.  If a die roll is high enough, you can use it to calm down a guest and if you calm the guest completely, they wake up and are removed from play.  Dice can also be used to learn extra skills and abilities, such as removing the Invader's health, or adding distractions to the Invader deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a battle of dice versus cards.  Do you have what it takes to save humanity and defeat The Nightmare Invader?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
