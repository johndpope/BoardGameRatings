			<description>Embargo is an abstract strategy game for 2 or 4 players. You begin the game with your six pieces arranged in a triangle on one corner of a chess board. Pieces rest on the points of the grid, not the spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you can move one of your pieces any distance in a horizontal or vertical direction, like a rook in chess. Your goal is to move all of your pieces to the opposite corner of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When two pieces of the same color share the same line without any other colored pieces between them, imagine an invisible wall extending between those two pieces. You cannot move your piece through any wall nor can you land a piece on a point currently occupied by a wall. (This rule applies even if you're trying to pass through a wall you created!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because walls apply equally to all players, it becomes dangerous to be too defensive. A diplomatic atmosphere emerges from these simple mechanics as your pieces dance around the board, avoiding walls and building new walls of their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Luchacabra website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This elegant abstract board game is deceptively simple. Move your pieces like chess rooks, trying to get to the opposite corner of the board. Uninterrupted lines between your pieces form imaginary walls that no pieces, not even your own, can cross. That&amp;rsquo;s it! Embargo is a strategic game of territorial control and sharing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
