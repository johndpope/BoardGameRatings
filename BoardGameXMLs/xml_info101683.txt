							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Asteroid Racers</name>
									
			<description>Asteroid Racers is a racing game in which players are racing space ships through an asteroid field. Players may attack their opponents during the race in order to slow them down. Before the race, players can build and customize their ship using a points system. Players have 35 points to spend on ship components. Each player has a playing mat that keeps track of all upgrades to the ship as well as damage received from the asteroids and other players. The game also includes an Asteroid deck of cards which players use to track race progress and events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Asteroid Racers is a fast game of resource management and card play. The goal for each player is to be the first to traverse the deadly asteroid belt, racing at brake neck speeds so that you can be the first to cross the finish line and be declared the newest Asteroid Race champion. Be careful though, not only do you have to deal with the dangers of the asteroid belt, but also the other racers, for they will be armed with deadly weapons and missiles, each trying to shoot you down before you can win the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
