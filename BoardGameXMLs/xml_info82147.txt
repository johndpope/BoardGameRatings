			<description>Dr. J and Larry Bird Go One on One, more commonly known as One on One, is a 1983 computer basketball game for the early era of home computers. It was developed by Eric Hammond and published by Electronic Arts (EA) and Ariolasoft in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, the player can assume the role of basketball greats Julius Erving or Larry Bird in a game of one-on-one against another player or the computer. Featuring outstanding animation for its era, the game allows for play to a certain score or timed games. On offense, a player could spin or shoot; on defense, attempt to block or steal the ball, with over aggressiveness penalized by fouls. A hard dunk could shatter the backboard, prompting a janitor to come out and sweep up the shards, directing censored complaints at the player in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One on One originated on the Apple II, but was ported to the IBM PC Jr, Commodore 64, Amiga, Macintosh, Atari 7800, Atari 8-bit, TRS-80 Color Computer and as a PC booter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
