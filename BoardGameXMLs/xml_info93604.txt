							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tribal Dice</name>
									
			<description>Tribal Dice is a unique new solitaire and interactive multiplayer game where players use eight dice with eight sides (8d8) in various colors. The dice represent tribal spirits that must be restored in an ancient ritual to save the tribe and determine the new chieftain. A spirit is fully restored when it shows the highest number, and when it shows that number, each one grants the player a different special power that can be invoked one time to influence the other dice in the game. Players can also re-roll matching dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory is predicated on strategic planning for which dice to re-roll, when and what order to invoke special powers, and some luck. The solitaire game provides a score, whether won or lost, that a player can attempt to improve over successive games. The multiplayer game has an adjustible game length and a high level of interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although current electronic implementations of the game allow only solitaire and three player multiplayer, it is possible to play with any number of players, and a special &amp;quot;chaos rule&amp;quot; allows for large groups to play the game without any downtime, as they can invoke their special powers out of turn order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
