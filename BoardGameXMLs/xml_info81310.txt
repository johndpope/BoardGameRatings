			<description>A car racing simulation for 2-12 players. Players advance their cars around the track by rolling 2d6, changing lanes only in designated space. If there are instructions in the space where the car ends its turn, the player must follow the directions in that space (draw cards, move forward, move backward, etc). Different sets of cards allow players to take different actions such as using a pit stop, changing lanes, advancing their car or incurring penalties. Winner is the first across the finish line after a predetermined number of laps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
