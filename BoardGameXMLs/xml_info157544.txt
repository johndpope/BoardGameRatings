							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Technology &amp; Trolls</name>
									
			<description>from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Technology &amp;amp; Trolls is a supplement for classic fantasy role - playing games that allows for elements of a science-fiction nature in the world of dragons and castles. It can also be used to take a classic fantasy role-playing game and use those rules in a more futuristic setting of major cities and computer technology. This supplement was written with a couple of ideas in mind. The first was to allow for enough information to create a fantasy adventure where alien spaceships crash landed in the world of pixies and unicorns. This place would still seem like a dungeon environment to the adventurers, where robots are golems and lasers are magical crossbows. The second was to take the fantasy role-playing game rules we love and have adventures in a dystopian future where major skyscrapers fill the cities, elves ride motorcycles, and dwarves carry plasma rifles . Instead of roaming dark dungeon hallways, adventurers traverse large buildings of corporate villains in search of money and technology. While a dragon may have been slain for terrorizing a village in ancient times, now a dragon runs a criminal organizati on preying on the weak and must be dealt with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
