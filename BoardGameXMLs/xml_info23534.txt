			<description>John could not believe his luck. His first day at Kung Fu University, and already he was involved in a duel. He had trained all his life to be able to test his skills in the martial arts, and here he was already getting a chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As he stood his ground, his tiger claw held high and ready, John watched his foe. She was a little thing, all dressed up in a bright floral dress with a blue ribbon in her hair. Maybe after the duel, they could go get a glass of milk together he thought to himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s when she hit him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waking up on the grass, John rubbed his chin where the girl in the flower dress had hit him. She stood over him offering a hand up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your Kung Fu was good, but mine was better,&amp;rdquo; she said with a smile as she walked away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maybe school would be a bit tougher then he thought, John mused as he chased after her, asking if she could show him how she did that kick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Kung Fu U, the game of martial arts combat and fun times. Can you out fight your foes before they bring you down with a surprise attack. Can your Kung Fu out shine your foe&amp;rsquo;s skills. Find out who is the best of the best with this exciting Mini-game from Bad Baby Productions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
