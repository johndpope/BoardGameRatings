							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pavilion Cricket</name>
									
			<description>Pavilion Cricket is a year round game designed to simulate, as realistically as possible, the results, performances and individual averages of the real game. In order to achieve this, Pavilion Cricket consists of three separate games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Domestic Cricket&lt;br/&gt;      This game covers domestic tour and one-day matches in England, Australia and the West Indies. A typical county match takes approx. 15 min. to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. One-Day Cricket&lt;br/&gt;      This game covers One-day Internationals and Domestic finals. More detailed than number 1., a typical game takes approx. 60 min. to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Test match Cricket&lt;br/&gt;      This game provides a ball-by-ball simulation of a full five-day test match. As the most detailed of the three games, each day's play takes approx. 90 min. to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By using a combination of the three games, a full season or tour may be played on an ongoing basis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Teams Book provided details full squads of players for a broad range of teams; falling into three categories: Domestic, Current International (early 1990's, but later Team Books are available), and Modern Greats. The inclusion of the Modern Greats teams allows many previously unresolved debates to be tested. For example, how would the awesome South African side of 1970 perform against some of the great West Indian sides of the 1980's?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
