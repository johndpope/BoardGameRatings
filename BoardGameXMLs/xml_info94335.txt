							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Races of the Bronze Sky: Kaylethon</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solidly built, four-armed giants, the Kaylethon resemble nothing so much as hoary skinned rhinoceroses. Powerful, broad, squat and strong the Kaylethon are built &amp;ndash; in temperament as well as physique &amp;ndash; for the life of warriors and they have a fearsome reputation as such, tempestuous, strong, and unwavering, bound up in a system of honor that can make them quick to turn in anger to defend their reputations and the status of their clans. More surprising, given their status as &amp;lsquo;primitive&amp;rsquo; warriors, the Kaylethon have a natural talent for crafts and technology. This is not so much a result of their intelligence, which is notoriously brutish and simplistic, but more down to an innate instinct for mechanism and device, a simple, bone-deep knowledge of how to put things together, to work stone and metal and shape it to create the forms that come to their minds, inspired by the materials they have to hand and their immediate need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
