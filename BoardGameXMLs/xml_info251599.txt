			<description>The goal is to be the first to win 20 hazelnuts.&lt;br/&gt;One can win hazelnuts by mimicking correctly and the right orders the gestures of Billy the hamster and Jean-Claude the worm on cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One after the other, the players draw cards that they place in front of them. They can stop drawing cards whenever they want (with a minimum of one card). When they think they have enough cards, they stop and say &amp;quot;Bandit servi !&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;The bandit is served!&amp;quot;). Then they have one second per card to memorize the gestures and the order of the cards. At the end of that time, the player closes their eyes and must mimic the gestures correctly and in the right order. If the player is correct, they win the amount of nuts on the cards, if not, they don't win or lose anything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three types of special cards:&lt;br/&gt;- double ration: if the player is correct, they win double the amount of nuts;&lt;br/&gt;- double temps (double time): the player has two seconds per card to memorize the gestures;&lt;br/&gt;- haut les pattes ! (paws up!): every player must rise their hands and say &amp;quot;paws up!&amp;quot;, the first one wins one nut from the bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;- 48 cards (including 8 special cards)&lt;br/&gt;- 35 nut tokens: 20x 1 nut tokens, 10x 5 nuts tokens, 5x 10 nuts tokens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
