			<description>Translated from the rule book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A lot of different pairs of cards lie scattered over the table. When revealing a card good eyes and quick hands are needed. Who keeps seeing everything and reacts fast fetches the most pairs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 54 cards, making 27 pairs of 2 cards each. The cards are put into a tile. Each player turns over the uppermost card on the tile and reveals it. As soon as the new card is revealed all players can put their hand on the other card of this pair, that was revealed before the current one. The player who has the most pairs when the tile is used up is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
