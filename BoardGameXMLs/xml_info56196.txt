							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Book of the Mind</name>
									
			<description>Introduction text:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With psionics, a character can read the minds of others, move objects without physically touching them, or travel across vast distances in an instant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than a character of any other class, the psionicist is self-contained. Unlike the fighter and rogue, he needs no weapons or tools to practice his art. Unlike the cleric, he needs no deity. Unlike the wizard, he relies on no outside energies. His power comes from within, and he alone gives it shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The psionicist strives to unite every aspect of his self into a single, powerful whole. He looks inward to the essence of his own being, and gains control of his subconscious. Through extraordinary discipline, contemplation, and self-awareness, he unlocks the full potential of his mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
