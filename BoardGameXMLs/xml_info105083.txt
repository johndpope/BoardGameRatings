							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Captain Goodnight and the Island of Fear</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the ages of nuclear blackmail, the devious Dr. Maybe has built and activated an atomic device somewhere on a remote island known only as &amp;quot;Doom Island.&amp;quot;  He has demanded $200 million to be delivered to him or he will set off the device&lt;br/&gt;and destroy the world. Furthermore, he has given the F.O.G. (Forces Of Good) only 24 hours to deliver the money. Of course, the F.O.G. does not want to pay him this absurd sum, so they have enlisted the help of you, Captain Goodnight, the defender of good. Only you can safely reach Doom Island and deactivate the Doomsday Device in the short time of 24 hours. If you fail, then the world will surely be destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
