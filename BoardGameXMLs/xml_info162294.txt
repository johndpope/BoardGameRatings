							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Undercroft (Issue 1 - Jul 2014)</name>
									
			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Heaven Everything is Fine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But not here. Here, everything is awful. If you aren't losing your limbs to obscure diseases you're having them lopped off by solicitors and disgruntled historical figures. Life is hard and short. As a consequence of this unfortunately tight schedule we must strive to pack as much misery into players' lives as possible. Their bodies and minds must be broken or at least so damaged as to wish they had been given a more conclusive result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not easy, oh no, but we're here to help. If you've never had a game where a player has retired their character due mental anguish, outraged at the morals they have so flagrantly tossed away, fondly looking back on a time where they had all their limbs, then The Undercroft is the place to go. We can help. Or maybe more accurately, &amp;quot;help&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Undercroft #1 we are showing you an alternative method for inflicting degenerative maladies, donated by the kindly Alex Clements. His take on delayed cruelty and lingering deaths is an inspiration to us all. Further in you will find a favourite of mine: lawyers. Crime has never been quite so fun, I fear it may lead us into a life on the seedy underbelly just for the thrill of being caught and the potential to create a loyal fan-base. Finally we have a little traditional adventure with a less traditional twist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
