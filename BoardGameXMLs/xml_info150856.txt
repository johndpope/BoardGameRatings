			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your skin burns as you lunge towards the armored figure. It turns, and a single blow of its lead fist sends you staggering backwards. Its face plate reveals only two glowing eyes. &amp;quot;Sorry pal,&amp;quot; it says in a distorted voice. &amp;quot;Nothing personal. I'm just trying to feed my kids.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meltdown and the AlphEx Corporation is short Super-Powered M&amp;amp;M book that presents a supervillain and several related NPCs for you to use in your M&amp;amp;M game. It contains not only game statics, but also character backgrounds, adventure hooks, and a sample story arc that demonstrates how to use Meltdown and the AlphEx Corporation as recurring elements in your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meltdown and the AlphEx Corporation includes the following NPCs:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Meltdown: A living radioactive battery who must wear a containment suit to prevent poisoning those around him.&lt;br/&gt;     Sebastian Gallows: The power-hungry CEO of the AlphEx Corporation, who forces Meltdown to commit crimes.&lt;br/&gt;     Keegan Scott: A former supervillain who now builds high-tech weapons for the AlphEx Corporation..&lt;br/&gt;     Dr. Amrita Chaudhary: A mutant with a life-draining touch, who is also a geneticist researching Meltdown's condition.&lt;br/&gt;     Enhanced Security: AlphEx security officers enhanced with super suits.&lt;br/&gt;     Heli-Drones: Robot helicopters used to assist AlphEx security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
