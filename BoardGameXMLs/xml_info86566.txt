							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Transmuter</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ever think that tacking on specialist wizards to the wizard core class was kinda lame? Ever think that the specialists needed to be written up as their own distinct classes? Yeah, us too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Transmuter is the fifth offering in The Core Specialist Wizard series. Each product of the series will present a different specialist as its own core, 20-level class, with distinctive abilities. Other related materials, including feats, two prestige classes tied to the core specialist class, and a small offering of related magic items, are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within The Transmuter you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The transmuter core class. These specialists wizards excel at changing one thing into another.&lt;br/&gt;     The fury prestige class. Barbaric masters of turning themselves into weapons.&lt;br/&gt;     The morph mage prestige class. Able to transform into progressively more powerful creature types.&lt;br/&gt;     7 new feats with a focus on the transmuter.&lt;br/&gt;     2 new magic items, the ever-weapon and casket of change.&lt;br/&gt;     5 new alchemical items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
