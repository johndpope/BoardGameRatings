							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Superman Flying Bingo</name>
									
			<description>This has nothing to do with the traditional game of Bingo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is given a supply of Superman discs. There are four colours so four can play. Each player flicks their discs on to the board which is a grid of 5 x 5 pockets. If a disc settles within a pocket, it stays there. The objective of each player is to form a row of five of his colour discs, to win the game. Getting five in a row is the only link to a Bingo game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
