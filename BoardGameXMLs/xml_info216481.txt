			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defection is a pick up and deliver, ship upgrade, tile turning and dice combat game set in a deep and developed sci-fi universe. &lt;br/&gt;Unwilling to fight in yet another war, you defect from your factions army in favour of transporting your civilians to safer planets. However, as with nearly all things, in all worlds, conflict and competition follow you. You will soon realise the buisness of saving lives can be as cut throat and deadly as the buisness of taking them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick Up and Deliver&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your civilians are caught in the crossfire of vengeful violence in which you no longer wish to partake. &lt;br/&gt;Load civilians, aid packages and other cargo on your ship and set out for safer planets to re-settle and colonise with your faction. &lt;br/&gt;Dominate other planets with your factions civilians and supply these planets to make them more valuable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ship Upgrade&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you are in the game to save civilians or in the game to take contracts and destroy others, there is the perfect ship for you.&lt;br/&gt;Hire crew, buy ships and upgrade them from the market. Will you stick with the base ship and pay to upgrade and hire new crew? or purchase bigger ships with unique abilities and upgrade those? Either strategy has its advantages. Whatever you decide, there are multiple ways to mod your dice pool and give yourself the best chances of success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tile Turning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travelling through space is a risky business, flipping and resolving hex tiles as you move. Each tile refreshes after use, making space constantly changing with potential danger at every turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dice Combat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the stats you have modded with crew, ships and upgrades, gather your dice and shoot. With upgrades and loot cards etc. allowing you to mitigate poor dice rolls and a flee system giving you the chance to avoid the worst, the combat system gives you a good balance of strategy and luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gain Legend&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legend is gained from winning battles, dominating colonised planets and completing contracts/events. Will your faction come out on top before the war on Keleressa meets its inevitable end?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the world in the graphic novel of the same name, released in 2017, featuring many characters, worlds and races from the comic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
