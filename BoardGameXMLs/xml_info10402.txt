			<description>King Arthur is dying and plans to leave his throne to the Prince who will do best in the quest to retrieve five crowns kept by Kraddoch, the evil Dragon. To do so, players (the Princes) fight over the control of five Knights who will perform the quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, Princes each receive a secret card indicating the order in which King Arthur would like to see the five Knights bring the crowns back. This order is different for each Prince. Player turns consist of multiple phases involving dice rolls during which they move Knights and resolve encounters and events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a Knight defeats the dragon, he brings the crown of his color back to the castle. Princes earn points for each crown making its way back to the castle in the exact order appearing on their card and for any accumulated treasure. The Prince with the highest point total inherits the throne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
