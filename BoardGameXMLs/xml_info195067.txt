							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Town of Glory</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grand Duke Iltobarus has taken a sudden interest in the Windreft, a remote area of dangerous wilderness made accessible by resolution of the civil war that has raged for decades in the Westmarches of Reme. He has granted lands and charter to a small group of settlers&amp;mdash;good, loyal Remen everyone&amp;mdash;to establish a new town there. These settlers will face danger, so the grand duke has called for brave and clever protectors to watch over the new town as it grows. That&amp;rsquo;s you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To keep the town safe, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to be on constant watch for enemies, and there are many in the Windreft. Orc tribes control much of the nearby foothills, hobgoblins camp in the north, boggards infest the waterwoods across the river, gnolls hunt in the open plains, and trolls sometimes wander down from the Green Mountains. And if some scholars are correct, Glory sits right above a mythical subterranean world called the Kingdom Beneath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Town of Glory presents a new rules mini-system for building and growing frontier communities, giving players and GMs multiple options to add onto their existing game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
