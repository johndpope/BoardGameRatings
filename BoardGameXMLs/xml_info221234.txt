			<description>From cassette inlay&lt;br/&gt;From the future ruled by an evil dictator, you have been sent back in time  by your resistance movement to try and alter the political balance of your own age. You have agreed to be trapped in a timewarp loop, in each of three eras for your cause, the gaining of a stable political climate for your pepe. You miust alter the balance of power during the three wars which happened in your past. You have been given a portable warp generator which will automatically transport you to the next age to engage in your task. This takes a little while to recharge before warping, so your job is to do as much damage to the enemy as you can in your stop at that time. If you fail, and let the situation reach the point at which historians say that the balance was altered, your generator will fail, and your will be stuck in that time, for the rest of your life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
