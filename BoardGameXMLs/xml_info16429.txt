							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mr. Potato Head Find Me</name>
									
			<description>This game features an electronic talking Mr. Potato Head that gives the players clues. Fifteen cards showing Mr. Potato Head in various outfits are placed face-up on the table. Each card has a unique combination of 3 special items that no other card contains. On your turn, you press a Special Part button (such as mustache or glasses) and Mr. Potato Head will tell you if the picture he's thinking of contains that item. If it doesn't, you turn all the pictures that have that item face down. If it does, you turn all the pictures that don't have that item face down. If you select a correct item, you may also guess at the picture by pressing 3 Special Part buttons for the unique parts that are in the one you think is correct. If you guess right, you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
