							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Wolf Rider Holiday</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hard ride on the twelfth night before Geheimnisnacht to fields of gold wheat, vineyard vines, shepherd shacks and villages with low walls. The goblin gourds have all been carved, their fires flickering inside, it is time to rise out of hiding, grab a spear and ride the wolves through falling leaves and floating ash. Months of preparation and a night to burn it all. Even goblins have their holidays.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was not designed to be run start to finish. This is a collection of encounters that occur the day before and through the night of Nazee Swoopa&amp;rsquo;s Goblin Holiday. All encounters have a connection to each other and are designed so that the players, through their decisions and actions, will dictate the direction the adventure will take.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
