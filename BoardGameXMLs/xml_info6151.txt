							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Amazing Spider-Man</name>
									
			<description>Hex-based board game for 2 players. One player plays the Amazing Spider-Man, and the other plays the bad guys. Spider-Man attempts to capture the enemies in rope or his web, and the bad guys try to enter a building with a armored car, break into it, and escape from Manhattan Island (or, if they prefer, to defeat Spider-Man).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall style is a hex-and-counter boardgame, with event cards and action cards to create variety from game to game. More light-hearted than most of Tsukuda's fare, this is part of their 'fun series' (as opposed to their 'not-any-fun series?). However, it is not overly simplistic, as the box does recommend Ages 12 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook is in Japanese, but the action and event cards are printed in both Japanese and English (on the same card, not two different sets). The map is in English (which, by the way, is 4 fold-out map sections that are combined to make one large map).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
