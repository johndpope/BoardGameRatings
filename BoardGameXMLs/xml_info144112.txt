							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Magus</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story follows a character named Magus who in a world of water and fire was imprisoned and tortured in the Waterfall Kingdom for unknown reasons. After many years he manages to escape with the help of a new prisoner named Kinna. Together they go on a quest to battle the forces that imprisoned Magus and prevent him from becoming the god he was meant to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combat is a color-based spell-casting mechanic where Magus must absorb color from the environment and use red, green, and purple magic to vanquish his foes. Players can specialize in one color or many and spell types will range from tornadoes to shape-shifting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
