							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bluebell Key</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters&amp;rsquo; assistance is requested from a bhoot named, Madam Serena Hollingberry of the Grave Digger&amp;rsquo;s Society, whose current residence is located in the Wig Weston Estate on the corner of Morgue and Crypt Street in the Victorian ring of Necropolis.  Mme. Hollingberry is an antiquarian who presides over the acquisition, identification and cataloging of objects of interest found in the field.  She is currently overwhelmed with a recent influx of artifacts from members and needs help rendezvousing with one such member.   &lt;br/&gt; Mme. Hollingberry is willing to pay the player characters a sum of 150 charons to meet with Derbie McMace, a zombie peddler, who just happened to come across a key of sorts.  While most keys aren&amp;rsquo;t of interest, the key was found in an abandoned tomb where it was locked away in a cherry box alongside a glowing bluebell flower.  The key is said to have unusual markings on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The task seems simple enough, or is it?  The Blue Bell Key is a mini-adventure to help introduce players to Spooks! Welcome to the Great Beyond game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
