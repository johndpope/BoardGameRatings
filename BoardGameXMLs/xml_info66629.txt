			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 4E rest system is built for campaigns where the characters delve through a dungeon, one encounter-filled room at a time, taking short rests between each one, until they reach the final room-encounter, and complete the dungeon. Now, the system isn&amp;rsquo;t broken, and it creates a certain type of experience, but if you&amp;rsquo;re running a different type of campaign, you need a different type of rest system. Rugged Adventures presents a system where players feel worn down after almost every fight, until they rest for the night. One encounter per day (or fewer!) will be all you&amp;rsquo;ll need to offer your players to make sure they&amp;rsquo;re being challenged. And all of this is achievable with just a few small changes to the rest system, with little or no impact to the remaining mechanics of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
