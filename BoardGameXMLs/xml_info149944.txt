			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Castle Builder Volume 2: Manor Houses is the second installment in a 10-part series designed to help Game Masters and players plan their ideal fortifications in a step-by-step format from the ground up. This installment reveals how being lightly fortified does not mean a building is unsuitable for use as a defensive structure. This volume&amp;rsquo;s contents include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     An introduction to manor houses, why people build them, and how they are perceived;&lt;br/&gt;     Various uses for such structures;&lt;br/&gt;     How to consider the most suitable uses of manor houses in your game;&lt;br/&gt;     Ideal locations for manor houses;&lt;br/&gt;     Two sample structures, a large inn and an aristocratic home, that illustrate two of the most common uses of this class of structure: commerce and power.&lt;br/&gt;     Five floorplans, two for the Hart &amp;amp; Vine inn and three for the Ellingsworth Estate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this book has no specific setting, it is designed to accommodate any technological era that one is likely to encounter in a fantasy campaign setting, from the Stone Age to the Renaissance. It is also fully bookmarked and hotlinked and designed to be printer-friendly and easy-to-use!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
