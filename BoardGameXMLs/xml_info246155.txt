			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was officially cancelled or abandoned and is no longer in development. An unfinished version(s) of it may or may not have been made available to the public at some point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Werewolf: The Apocalypse was a video game with plans to release the game on the original Sony PlayStation and the Sega Saturn. Based on the world of White Wolf's roleplaying game Werewolf: The Apocalypse, WTA was a 3D brawler with an overhead isometric-style perspective. Players could choose one of seven characters, including characters from the tabletop game like Mari Cabrah, and do battle with typical Werewolf foes like Fomori, Black Spiral Dancers and Banes. The game was never finished, and only an early and very rough prototype has ever been seen publicly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
