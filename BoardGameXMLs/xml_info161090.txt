			<description>2, 3 or 4 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Materials&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hexagonal board with 5 hexagons per side, 64 stones in four colors, 16 red, 16 yellow, 16 green and 16 blue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will also need a small drawstring bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Definitions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Group &amp;ndash; A set of like color connected stones, a single stone is also considered a group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is placed between the players and starts out empty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place 4 stones 1 each of the 4 colors (red,green,blue,yellow) in a bag and then the youngest player draws a stone and passes the bag to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all the stones are drawn players look at their stones without revealing them to the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All stones will remain hidden until the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The color of drawn stones corresponds to the color of the stones that belong to that player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The remaining 60 stones are placed nearby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The youngest player starts by dropping a stone of any color onto an empty hexagon, then turn moves clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From now on, each player on his turn must drop 1 stone of any color onto an empty hexagon and then move a different stone already on the board to another empty hexagon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Restrictions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A stone may not be dropped onto a cell that has no adjacent empty cell.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A stone is moved in a straight line either orthogonally until another stone in its path or the edge of the board blocks it. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Stones cannot jump over other stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player is unable to take his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then reveal their hidden stones, the player with the largest group in her color wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If two or more players are tied when comparing their largest groups then look at their second largest groups as a tie-breaker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing a 2 or 3 player game the rules are the same as above with but one exception, leave the undrawn stones in the bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
