							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Faces of Thedas: Varric</name>
									
			<description>From Green Ronin's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wherever he goes, Varric Tethras (wisecracking rogue and stalwart companion in the Dragon Age 2 video game) makes friends, learns the local stories, and gleans the choicest scuttlebutt. Wherever he goes, his prized and distinctive crossbow, called Bianca, is sure to be at hand. Wherever he goes, he encounters trouble and treasures worth telling about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Faces of Thedas: Varric, we learn a version of Varric's tale that might even be close to the truth. This Dragon Age RPG DLC begins with an exclusive interview with Mary Kirby, the BioWare in-house writer whose words brought Varric to life, and who seems to know more about him than she's telling. (&amp;quot;There was a girl, and I made a promise. Bianca is the only story I can never tell.&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the interview you'll find Varric's background and ways to use him in your Dragon Age RPG campaign, followed by game statistics for the rogue at levels 1 and 5, including guidelines for using the Contacts talent at home and away, and for creating signature items for PCs. Finally, we give you game statistics for The Hanged Man tavern in Kirkwall, Varric's signature leather duster, and of course the crossbow Bianca herself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
