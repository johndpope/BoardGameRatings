							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Coccinella&#039;s Racing</name>
									
			<description>This is a racing game, freely inspired by the egiptian game of Senet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to bring all you pieces to the other side of the 30-spaces board; the piece move according to the dice throw: with 2,3,4,6 you can chose to move one piece of that amount. With 1 you move one piece of 1 space but can repeat the turn. With 5 you move ALL your pieces of 1 space. Spaces already occupied by own pieces can never be reached. Opponent pieces can instead be captured or jumped, unless they are in groups of 2 or 3 respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;Who will be the first to bring his beetle to the finish line ?&lt;br/&gt;A fun tactical contest....with a little bit of luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
