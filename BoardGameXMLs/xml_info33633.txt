							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Little Engine That Could</name>
									
			<description>This game recreates the story of &amp;quot;The Little Engine That Could.&amp;quot;  Each player is a toy trying to get over the mountain and into the city.  There are four toy choices: a teddy bear, a plush elephant, a doll, and a monkey wearing a fez.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player is the player with the closest upcoming birthday and spins the arrow.  The spinner has blue squares, yellow stars, pink hearts, purple triangles, and green clowns.  If the player spun to the green clown, the player takes a second turn.  A player that ends his or her turn at the bridge can take a shortcut.  The first person to get to the city wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
