							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">High Seas Fleet</name>
									
			<description>High Seas Fleet is a simple game of strategic naval war in the Atlantic, Baltic, and Mediterranean set during World War One. All major ships of the participating powers are included, including dreadnoughts, pre-dreadnoughts, and squads of lighter ships. Historically, the German fleet only challenged the British once, culminating in the Battle of Jutland. This game allows players to explore what might have happened had the Germans been more aggressive and persistent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules of High Seas Fleet are based on the rules system of the classic games of the 1970s, War At Sea and Victory in the Pacific. However, High Seas Fleet introduces a number of innovations to keep the system fresh. The combat system has been modified to mitigate the extremes of luck and Command Cards introduce a degree of both flexibility and uncertainty. Allies can enter based on your efforts to recruit them and stay or go based on your success on the high seas. The game system remains clean and simple, perfect for introducing youngsters or novices to historical gaming, yet substantial enough to reward the veteran gamer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Played on a map that includes the North Atlantic, Baltic, and Mediterranean regions, High Seas Fleet includes both introductory and standard rules, plus several scenarios including a single-turn, introductory scenario of the Battle of Jutland, and even some alternative history scenarios, as well as a campaign game that covers the entire war. Complexity is low for the Basic Rules to moderate for the Standard Rules (about 2/10 to 3.5/10 respectively).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
