							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">6 Spell-Less Ranger Feats</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes rules supplements read like the world-setting bible of frustrated novelists. While solid world- building is a useful skill, you don&amp;rsquo;t always need four paragraphs of flavor text to tell you swords are cool, magic is power, shadows are scary, and orcs are savage. Sometimes a GM doesn&amp;rsquo;t have time to slog through a page of history for every magic weapon. Sometimes all that&amp;rsquo;s needed are a few cool ideas, with just enough information to use them in a game. Sometimes, all you need are bullet points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    1 With A Bullet Point is a line of very short, cheap PDFs each of which gives the bare bones of a set of related options. It may be five spells, six feats, eight magic weapon special abilities, or any other short set of related rules we can cram into about a page. Short and simple, these PDFs are for GMs and players who know how to integrate new ideas into their campaigns without any hand-holding, and just need fresh ideas and the rules to support them. No in-character fiction setting the game world. No charts and tables. No sidebars of explanations and optional rules. Just one sentence of explanation for the High Concept of the PDF, then bullet points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The High Concept: Six new feats to help rangers who have given up their spell ability (such as the spell-less ranger from New Paths: Expanded Spell-Less Ranger and skirmishers from the Advanced Player&amp;rsquo;s Guide) redirect their unused mystic energies in a way that helps compensate for their lack of the flexible, mystic bonuses spells can provide. This is the latest in a series of products to celebrate the &amp;quot;Summer of Bullets&amp;quot; event!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six feats included are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Bestial Surge: You can call on your spiritual connection to the animal kingdom to gain temporary bonuses.&lt;br/&gt;    Blood Enemies: You can forge a link of enmity in blood.&lt;br/&gt;    Defensive Lore: You can use your knowledge of enemies and the environment to defend yourself against spells and other effects.&lt;br/&gt;    Improved Hunting Bond: You can quickly give allies broad advice on how to fight your favored enemies.&lt;br/&gt;    Take Cover: You always know how to get cover when in a favored terrain.&lt;br/&gt;    Woodland Juggernaut: You have studied the heavily armor creatures of nature, from armadillos to rhinos, and learned to emulate their ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
