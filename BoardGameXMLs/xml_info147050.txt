			<description>From rules (translated):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Harkinta-peli (Consideration) you play with differences: shapes, colors, sizes and thicknesses. Each play tile has their own special properties and each property gives one point. No tile is exactly the same as another. In this game a child can learn with an adult to see the differences in the tiles and in which way a tile differs from one or more other tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Observation capabilities develop and after a few rehearse tries the player is able to pick out the best place for a tile on the board so that it differs as much as possible from the previous tiles, at the same time making it harder for the other players to find good placements, thus keeping them from gaining points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you have to think forward, plan your next move and rethink your moves when your opponents do not play a tile that would've given the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Year published is a guess based on picture)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
