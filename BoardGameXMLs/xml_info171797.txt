							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Time Bingo</name>
									
			<description>Time Bingo is an educational game designed to teach children to read analog clock faces. This game plays the same as traditional bingo, but with a twist. Each player is given a card with a series of different-looking analog clock faces depicted--with Roman numerals, Arabic numerals or no numbers. The caller then draws cards with times depicted in digital format. The called may either read the time aloud, show the card to the player or do both. Players must then read the clock faces on their card and mark any matching times. First player to complete a row or column of clock faces calls bingo. The caller then checks to make sure they have made the correct matches, and if so declares that player the winner. If not, play continues until a row or column is correctly completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
