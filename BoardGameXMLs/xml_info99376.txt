			<description>48 cards in sets of four, each card in a set being numbered from 1 to 4. A noisy set collecting card game that urges you to be 'quirky' in your calls for certain cards. You literally have to make a call as if you were the street vendor yourself. The number on the card you are seeking means you have to make the shout that many times. The cards represent street vendors and this must date from after WWI because there is a striking difference between these cards and most of the publisher's other games (which were printed in Germany).&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt a hand and if they can collect a set of four identical cards, then they can reveal them and claim a trick. The most tricks after they have all been claimed, wins.&lt;br/&gt;From the rules; &amp;quot;A very amusing card game, ideal for children aged 7 to 70. For 3 players or more players, the more the merrier&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
