			<description>Kuku is a Polish traditional card game for two or more players. It's slightly modified version of Kemps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is played with standard deck of 52 cards. Each player is dealt a hand of 3 cards, but one player is dealt a hand of 4 cards. The rest of cards are irrelevant. If any player has three cards in the same color or value he says &amp;quot;kuku!&amp;quot; and wins. After dealing the player with 4 cards gives one of his cards to the player on his left. One card (not necessarily the same) is going around until one of the players has three cards in the same color or value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
