			<description>Let the stories begin&amp;hellip;..Zing! gives you a delicious set of words (with three difficulty levels). With those and a few of your own, you develop a sentence. You&amp;rsquo;ll score points for every Zing! word you use. Players take turns adding to your sentence until you have a story!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t write? You&amp;rsquo;ll be surprised&amp;hellip; Zing! brings you in and gets you creating, writing and laughing in a flash! Discover new ways of thinking. The outcome is, well, ZING!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And when the stories have been told (after a few twists and turns) the player with the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version is in a small travel tin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
