			<description>Translated from the Italian box:&lt;br/&gt; In ancient times the wise Mother Earth gave birth to the Tribe of Tribes, whose destiny was to dominate the world. This lit the fierce anger of the Big Shadow, that made the world fall into the prison of the eternal alternation between light and darkness, and destroyed the Tribe. But the shaman escaped the vindicative rage and painted on a sacred and inviolable rock, with few primitive signs, the secret to win the dark power of the Big Shadow.&lt;br/&gt;Many and many ages are passed since then. Six glorious Predestined tribes, heirs of the ancient Tribe, decide to face the challenge with the Big Shadow. Their names: Tralon, Orgos, Ab-Diar, Naum, Zark, Groden.&lt;br/&gt;Now, you are the chiefs of those tribes. You have to reach the sacred rock, find the Ancient Sequence, transmit it to your Shaman and defeat the Big Shadow, with great honor. But the path for the sacred rock is long and dangerous. Right outside the village you'll wet yourselves in the Circle of the River of Life, where you can get the gifts of the Language, but you'll have to fight the Salamanders and the Rages, moved by the Big Shadow, to be able to get to the successive Circle, the Land of Chaos. Here you'll be lit with the ancestral frenzy, you'll fight with spears and hatchets the chiefs of the other tribes. Only if you were brave you'll be able to go to the Circle of the Initiation Sea, where you'll learn how to communicate with other tribes. With this you'll finally have completed your Table of the Language and you'll be able to enter the Final Circle: the Knowledge. Here, if you won't get burned by the fire of knowledge, you will be able to read the Ancient Sequence, go back to your village, say the remembered formula and, if it correct, win the game.&lt;br/&gt;But warning: the Big Shadow will try every path to stop you or even win the challenge by covering the whole Circle of Knowledge with its dark presence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you have read the game is divided in several parts, each of which has a different objective, that, when reached, will allow players to go to the next part. One of the player is the Big Shadow, and plays against all the others.&lt;br/&gt;Pretty nice but very long game with few standard mechanics and well made components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
