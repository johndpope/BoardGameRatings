			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People have known about that old fort since it burned down but no-one knows why or how. Once in a while rumours of a necromancer and its undead servants comes to light but nothing ever seems to come of it and while folklore recounts a mage lived nearby surely that was centuries ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently undead have been sighted in the area, people have been attacked and sturdy adventurous folk are needed to get to the bottom of it. Can the characters discover the truth about the fort&amp;rsquo;s origins and stop the undead menace for ever?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is designed for four characters of 5th level in the Fifth Edition of the world&amp;rsquo;s oldest roleplaying game but can be easily adapted to higher levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
