							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mind&#039;s Eye Theatre: Laws of the Wild Changing Breeds: 3</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Won't You Come Into My Parlor?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vermin are always swept aside - few consider what they see. What does the rat see from his hiding-spot under the wharfs? What does the humble spider, spinning in the corner, overhear? No one asks and no one knows. The Ratkin continue their earth-wars from the shadows, and the Ananasi prepare for a time when balance will return. One day, these not-so-meek will inherit the earth...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rats in the Walls&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Changing Breeds Book Three comprises the worlds of the Ananasi and the Ratkin. Here the Ananasi build their webs and plots in deference to their hostage queen, serving the primal forces of the universe. Here the Ratkin nurse bitter grudges against the Garou and humanity who hunt them, and fight the Weaver's strangling webs with their own brand of eco-terrorism. Patterned after the first two Changing Breed books, here is everything a player could want to create and play one of these strange shapeshifters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
