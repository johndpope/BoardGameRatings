			<description>A One-Round Ravenloft Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module is based (loosely) on Macbeth. I&amp;rsquo;m not Shakespeare. I just like what he wrote. For those who haven&amp;rsquo;t read the play, here&amp;rsquo;s the condensed, condensed, shortened version. There&amp;rsquo;s a warrior (Macbeth) who is given a high position by the king. However, he&amp;rsquo;s not satisfied, so he kills the king and takes the throne. Then, he starts to lose it. Now that he&amp;rsquo;s killed the king, he has to kill everyone involved in the crime (no witnesses, you know). Macbeth even has to kill his best friend because his best friend might suspect Macbeth of killing the king.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The whole story is based on the idea of descending into madness. Losing one&amp;rsquo;s sanity can be a horrifying event. Watching helplessly while someone that you know loses their sanity can be equally as horrifying. It is this kind of horror that this module will be focusing on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
