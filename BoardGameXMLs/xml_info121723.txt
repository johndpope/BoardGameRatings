			<description>This is the first game in the OneChanbara series.  It established the hack and slash gameplay with the player controlling Aya, a Japanese cowgirl in a bikini who wears a scarf and wields a katana. The player is pitted against hordes of zombies and nightmarish boss creatures, who spill torrents of blood when they are attacked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players guide their characters through the stages, completing tasks while hacking through enemies. The player-character's weapon becomes progressively covered in blood, causing their attacks to be slower and to inflict less damage, even getting stuck in enemies if it gets too bad. This is represented by a &amp;quot;Blood Meter&amp;quot; showing how dirty the weapon is. To prevent this, players must actively clean off their sword to keep the blood meter from filling up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, there is also the &amp;quot;Blood Lust&amp;quot; meter. As a character kills enemies, this meter starts to fill. Once the meter is full, the character will go into a &amp;quot;blood frenzy&amp;quot;. This gives the character an increase in attack power, but drains health. To recover from a blood frenzy, the player must use statue items, which are dropped by dead enemies. Additionally each level will contain a large statue. Going to the large statue will remove the blood frenzy and also recover any lost health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Simple 2000 Series Vol. 61: The Oneechanbara&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For proposed sequels and new platform projects for this game series, see the developer's website at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.d3p.co.jp/one/portal.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.d3p.co.jp/one/portal.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
