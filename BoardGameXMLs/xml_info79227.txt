			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;What if the Zombies stopped attacking just long enough to let the living think they were gone, only to show back up years later...and with the knowledge to wield weapons?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's the premise behind Nation Red where the player will fend off Zombies wielding axes, pistols, and other deadly weapons that used to be reserved for the non-zombie types only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though the user is restricted to a small area to fight in they can pick up abilities and weapons to help fend off the horde. Enough kills will earn the player a level in which they can choose a perk from a list and then continue on with their fighting. The perks range from health and weapon benefits, to special abilities that, for a short time, give the player an edge over the gun wielding zombies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Co-op play allows players, either on the same computer or over network play, to team up to defeat the horde and live another day...or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
