			<description>A storytelling card game. Includes 55 unique cards (no duplicates) of photographed wildlife, mostly of raccoons. The game is &amp;quot;creative and non-competitive&amp;quot;. Game play variations abound. For example players alternate drawing a card from the face down draw pile and place face up, and then describe the scene in a single sentence as it relates to previously drawn cards. A sequence of cards, left to right thereby tells a story. A variation has each player offer a scene description and then all players vote on the best one. Another alternative has players maintain a hand of cards and on their turn offer a card to extend the story, or all players offer one card and then vote on the best story extension with that one card added to the card sequence. Although not intended as a competitive game, it could be played where the winner is the first that runs out of cards (discarding your last card requires coming up with an ending better than any other players' story extensions), or collects the most rejected cards. A variation of &amp;quot;Go Fish&amp;quot; can be played where one player turns over a card, and then all players attempt to turn over the best matching card. The player with the best match as determined by vote takes the two matching cards, all other cards are turned back over, and that player turns over the next card to be matched.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
