							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mezza Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Mezza means &amp;quot;half&amp;quot; in Italian &amp;ndash; and in this game the &amp;frac12; card is key. It is the lowest card in the game, but it can suddenly become the highest. The game is a quirky and fun variation of the popular 'shithead'. It has unique cards with a colourful design and the game has new exciting rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Played in groups from 2 to 5, the players try to get rid of their cards first to win. Each player is dealt three cards face down and three cards face up on top of them. Another three cards become the player's hand. The players take turns clockwise and play al least one card equal to or higher than the last card on the discard pile. They may play multiple cards of the same rank at once. If a player cannot play a card, he must pick up the discard pile and add it to his hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first stage of the game players play with the cards in their hand and replenish their hand with cards from the stock pile (to three). Once the stock pile and a player's hand is empty, the player may begin playing his face up cards and thereafter his face down cards one by one. At this point the game starts to become very strategic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains wildcards that may be played on every card and there are cards that activate a special action such as 'skip a turn' or 'play a card lower' (instead of higher). The &amp;frac12; card is the twist of the game. It can be combined with the cards 3&amp;frac12;, 6&amp;frac12; and 9&amp;frac12; to form a new rank (4, 7 or 10) and activate a corresponding action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play an extra fast and exciting game there is a short version of the game for 2 or 3 player in which some cards can be removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
