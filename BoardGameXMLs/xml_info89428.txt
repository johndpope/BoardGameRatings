			<description>Adult version of the Bezzerwizzer+ family edition, the game is basically a trivia game with some new added elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main differences between the normal trivia game and Bezzerwizzer+ Adult is that you have a xylofone and questions regarding picking the right tune, guessing the right song etc. Also there are questions regarding remembering differences on pictures, logic and numbers, but also normal trivia questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a traditional Bezzerwizzer board, and the draw question mechanism ensures that previous versions of the game can be fully incorporated into this game also.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be played in up to four teams, consisting of as many players as you want, recommended is two-three per team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
