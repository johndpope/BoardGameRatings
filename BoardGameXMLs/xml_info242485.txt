							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ghost Hunter: Angels &amp; Demons</name>
									
			<description>Angels and Demons is the 5th deck to be added to the Ghost Hunter cannon. In this card game you must compete to capture the angelic and the diabolical a like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards feature gothic art of angels and daemons from holy lore as voted for by the backers. This theme is replicated in the special rules which sees each Angel matched with an opposing Demon.  You as a Ghost Hunter must choose which to specialize in capturing, for the best bonuses in your final score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghost Hunter: Angels &amp;amp; Demons is a card game for 2 &amp;ndash; 6 players that should last between 10-30 minutes. Players take it in turns to lay higher and higher cards on a central stack. If a player can&amp;rsquo;t lay an equal or higher card on the stack then they have to pick it up. If a player manages to lay a group of 3 cards at once then they get to capture the stack. Plenty of the cards come with special rules that you can manipulate to turn the game your way. The first player to play all of their cards ends the game and then players count up the scores of all of the cards that they captured minus all of the cards that they didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to get rid of. The player with the highest score wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are simple but the strategies can be complex. Skill and luck play their parts in equal measure in this short but engaging card game. It pays to get rid of your cards and be the Ghost Hunter who ends the game but victory is never assured until the final scores are counted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a standalone game but can be combined with the other Ghost Hunter decks for variation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
