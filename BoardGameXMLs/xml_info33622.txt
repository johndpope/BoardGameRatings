			<description>Vencer o Morir (to win or die) covers the largest single battle of the Chaco War in December, 1933.&lt;br/&gt;Known as the Battle of Campo Via, the Paraguayan&amp;rsquo;s had massed (with the knowledge of the Bolivians&amp;rsquo; air reconnaissance) twice as many   divisions aimed at the thinly defended lines and no Bolivian reserves. Just north of Alihuata, the Bolivian lines simply dangled. The warnings Kundt received from his own commanders along the front were all ignored. Fearing the worse, the Bolivian commander, Banzer, ordered part of his&lt;br/&gt;artillery, his tanks and ammo to be moved south to Saavedra.&lt;br/&gt;The battle began Dec. 3 and ended on the 12th.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;The map scale is about 2 miles per hex.&lt;br/&gt;Each combat unit is a battalion sized unit. HQ&amp;rsquo;s are represented by a Paraguayan or Bolivian flag.&lt;br/&gt;A game turn represents one day.&lt;br/&gt;Tanks and Armor cars represent one of each type.&lt;br/&gt;Artillery are batteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
