							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Raiders II</name>
									
			<description>Star Raiders II is a video game released in 1986 for the Atari 8-bit home computers, and later several other home computers and game consoles. The game was originally developed as part of a tie-in with the movie The Last Starfighter, which featured an arcade game of the same name as part of its plotline. During development the tie-in was dropped, and the game converted into a sequel to Star Raiders by changing a number of gameplay elements. The gameplay remained quite different than the original Star Raiders. Versions with The Last Starfighter branding made their way into the warez channels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Star_Raiders_2,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
