							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">You&#039;ve Been Hacked</name>
									
			<description>The game can be played in two different modes. The &amp;quot;Training Operation&amp;quot; mode is a free-for-all where players try to prove they are the most qualified hacker for the secret agent position. The &amp;quot;Special Operation&amp;quot; mode is a team mode (all vs. one) where one player takes on the role of a rogue agent trying to protect secret information. The other players try to recover all of the critical data before security shuts the whole system down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In both modes gameplay proceeds in turns. During a player's turn he will move his pawn from one tile to another (which represents accessing different computer systems) across connection points, revealing facedown tiles in the process. Each revealed tile will indicate how many data tokens are to be placed on the tile facedown. A player on that tile can choose to take the data tokens which each indicate a value on their face which is kept hidden from the other players. Collected data tokens can be saved by a player by returning to his start tile. A player can also leave firewall and virus tokens on a tile which will slow other players down. In addition to finding data on revealed tiles, players can also find antivirus tokens and firewall access tokens which will allow them to move to a tile containing a virus or firewall. If two players' pawns are on the same tile one of them may initiate a hack attack, which involves rolling dice. The victor may steal a data token from the loser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues for 11-15 rounds after which the player who has saved the most data is the winner (in &amp;quot;Training Operation&amp;quot; mode).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;Special Operation&amp;quot; mode the rogue agent must prevent the other agents from retrieving all of the data tokens before time runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
