			<description>From the Chaosium website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Call of Cthulhu Roleplaying in the 23rd Century&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the year 2271.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The future is a dark and dangerous place. Outer space is the new frontier &amp;mdash; humanity exploits the galaxy for its own ends. It is more than a hundred and fifty years since the United Earth Federation began to colonise the solar system and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Millions of colonists &amp;mdash; employees of either the Federation or one of the many megacorporations &amp;mdash; live out their lives on worlds light years from Earth. Corporate-funded exploration craft push ever-deeper into space. It is only a matter of time before one of these craft stumbles upon some remote, alien edifice, a cosmic mausoleum of the Great Old Ones. But who is to say this has not already occurred?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take the roles of the investigators of the future. These enlightened and oft-unlucky individuals know something of the true nature of the universe. Be they fools or heroes, they take the fight against the Great Old Ones to the stars themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This monograph is comprised of two parts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part one provides an overview of human society in the late 23rd Century, enabling Keepers to create a backdrop against which to set a campaign almost 300 years into our future. It is by no means exhaustive. Keepers can use it as a starting point for their own campaigns, or use the campaign scenarios available from the Cthulhu Rising website at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.cthulhurising.co.uk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.cthulhurising.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part two provides supplemental rules for generating 23rd Century Investigators, as well as information on the equipment and weapons that will aid them in combating dark cults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PART 1: The world of Cthulhu Rising &lt;br/&gt;Timeline 2026 &amp;ndash; 2271 &lt;br/&gt;Life in the 23rd Century &lt;br/&gt;Government and Politics &lt;br/&gt;The Colonies &lt;br/&gt;Corporations &lt;br/&gt;The Cthulhu Rising Mythos&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PART 2: Rules &lt;br/&gt;Character Generation &lt;br/&gt;Psychic Powers &lt;br/&gt;Combat &lt;br/&gt;Hardware &lt;br/&gt;Equipment &lt;br/&gt;Notes &lt;br/&gt;Cthulhu Rising Character Sheet - Front &lt;br/&gt;Cthulhu Rising Character Sheet - Back&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
