			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gravewalkers are a strange race of halfundead humans exposed to dark energies that have altered their physiology on a fundamental level. Shunned by most, the Gravewalkers build small ghettoes in ruins or near graveyards or old crypts. They are often morticians or grave diggers- they act as caretakers for the dead, but also use them as a form of labor and protection for their grim communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rare Gravewalker heroes often become especially skillful, tenacious undead hunters. They take it upon themselves to hunt down wild undead and put them to final rest. Perhaps they do so because they view such animate dead as monstrous perversions of the scared rest all dead deserve, or perhaps they hunt the dead out of self loathing or self interest&amp;hellip;. by destroying predatory undead they prove to fully-alive humans and other races that their race is more than just a collection of ghouls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
