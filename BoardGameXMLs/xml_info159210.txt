			<description>Sportsfriends is a multiplayer video game created by the Danish independent developer collective Die Gute Fabrik, known for their previous title Where is my Heart?. It consists of four games: Johann Sebastian Joust (J.S. Joust), Super Pole Riders, BaraBariBall, and Hokra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Pole Riders is a polevaulting game created by Bennet Foddy, developer of QWOP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;J.S. Joust is a local multiplayer no-graphics contact sport video game created by Douglas Wilson. The objective of the game is to be the last man standing. This is done by players trying to cause a rapid motion in their opponent's controller: a PlayStation Move. During the game, music from Johann Sebastian Bach's Brandenburg concertos is played at a slow tempo. In relation to a player being knocked out, there is a tolerance of motion the controller will allow that is linked to the speed of the music. As the speed of the music increases, so does the motion tolerance, which allows players to move more rapidly without setting off their controller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BaraBariBall is a 2-4 player sports game that draws comparisons to well known fighting games such as Super Smash Bros. and PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, since the game focuses heavily on platforming. BaraBariBall injects a ball and goal into the platforming fighter genre, taking the priority away from killing an opponent. Instead, the players focus on scoring by throwing or dunking the ball into the opposing players' water, scoring two points upon a successful dunk. The players attempt to knock the ball out of each other's grasp by attacking the player in possession of the ball with directional based combat similar to Super Smash Bros. However, the players are not limited to only one or two jumps, instead able to jump up to eight times as long as the player still has enough &amp;quot;charges&amp;quot;. These are represented by circles floating around the character, which are consumed each time a player jumps and recharge as long as the player is on the ground. Once the player runs out of circles, the player falls. If a player falls into the water (the goals), the player dies and re-spawns at the center of the stage a few seconds later, causing their team to lose a point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sportsfriends&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User addition:&lt;br/&gt;Hokra is a minimalist sports game, where players are split into teams of green or pink squares. The goal of the game is to grab the ball and hold it in your team's score zone for as long as possible. Players can dash and pass the ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
