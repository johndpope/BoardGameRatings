			<description>Drawn: The Painted Tower is an adventure-puzzle casual game developed by Big Fish Studios, and distributed by Big Fish Games. It is the first installment in the Drawn series. The game is available exclusively at Big Fish Games website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawn: The Painted Tower unfolds in a land devoid of all happiness. A young girl named Iris represents the last bastion of hope. Anything she draws comes to life, and her imagination moves her to sketch and paint medieval scenes filled with mythical creatures. With this power at her disposal, there are those who would seek to capture the Iris and harness her magic for their own gains. It was for this reason her family sent her into exile to protect her from harm. However, an evil king has discovered her whereabouts and is bent on her capture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player must enter the puzzle-filled hallways of the Painted Tower, locate, and save Iris. Many objects in the game are not what they appear to be and player's must explore each scene to unlock all the locks and puzzles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Drawn: The Painted Tower&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
