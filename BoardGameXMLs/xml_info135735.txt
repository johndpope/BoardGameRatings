			<description>This is a knowledge-game, much alike many Trivia and quiz games. However, the questions are based on the information in one of the Dutch Encyclopaedias: de 'Grote Winkler Prins'.&lt;br/&gt;The board represents a library, where players move their marker through different rooms, in which they have to answer a question about the theme of the room, History, Language, Sports etc. When the players gets the right answer, they receive a book-shaped counter. 10 counters (for each category 1) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
