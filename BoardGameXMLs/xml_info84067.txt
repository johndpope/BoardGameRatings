							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Modern Magic Items III</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creation's Edge Games brings you fifty new magic items with a contemporary slant. Here's a collection of commonplace items with not so common abilities:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anything Bag, Message Balloon, Portable Wall Safe and the Sound Storm Whistle to name a few.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sample:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mana Monsters Land Card (lightning fields) &lt;br/&gt;This is a card from a popular collectible card game that somehow has become imbued with mystic powers. The owner of this card is protected to a degree from electricity attacks provided the card remains within 5 feet of them. The owner takes half damage from any such attacks. As a one use function the owner can tear the card in half. This tearing triggers an electricity blast that deals 5d6 points electricity damage to all creatures within 20 feet of the card excluding the owner. The card loses its abilities once it is torn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
