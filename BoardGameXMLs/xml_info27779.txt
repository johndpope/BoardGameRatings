							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Zombies of Los Muerte High</name>
									
			<description>Zombies have infested Los Muerte High! As your teachers shamble about trying to eat your brains, you begin to formulate a plan. It might just work, but it&amp;rsquo;s going to take everything in your locker to convince enough students to help get it done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two characters come up that provide icons towards completing your plan (which you need at the end of the game) and popularity points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players bid a card face down from their hand. Highest bid takes first choice of cards but loses their bid card, second highest bid takes the remaining card and keeps their bid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, sometimes a Zombie is among the character cards who makes completing a plan more difficult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
