			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The time comes in the life of every campaign world when the Game Master has to figure out why things don&amp;rsquo;t cost the right amount of money. Whether it is because the player characters are becoming merchants or everyone keeps trying to figure out why a two-handed battle axe costs less than a dagger, eventually the questions begin. As a Game Master you don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of choices. The game&amp;rsquo;s rule book will not be enough, and you don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend the time to do it yourself.&lt;br/&gt;Grain Into Gold is a fantasy world economy, a fully fleshed out economy for any fantasy world. Between excessive research into historic and modern economic factors and decades of professional experience designing role-playing games and worlds, the folks at Board Enterprises have produced another of their &amp;ldquo;Simple and Sane&amp;rdquo; supplements. Preserve game balance while at the same time establishing a realistic setting. Players will be happier, and you as the game master will be happier. (Grain Into Gold is written in a light style, so as to not put you to sleep like your last economics course did.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains:&lt;br/&gt;70 pages of discussion on the basis for the economy and how the drivers of labor, materials and demand interact. Grain Into Gold is written in a more light hearted and casual tone. This is NOT a text book, but a very common-sense approach to fantasy economics and how it can work in your world.&lt;br/&gt;A discussion on exactly what you need to do to make an economy work for your world. This is a step by step, &amp;ldquo;how-to&amp;rdquo; that will guide you right to the end result - a working economy that you can use in game, now. Not after weeks or months of work.&lt;br/&gt;Charts detailing agriculture, ranching, textiles, salaries, and a price list containing over 500 items, including variations due to local trade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
