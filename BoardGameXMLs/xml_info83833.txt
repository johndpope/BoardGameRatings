			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the latest installment of the Master at Arms series, Blackdirge Publishing takes a look at one of the most popular weapons of all time: the longspear or pike. Although it rarely gets the attention it deserves in the d20 system, the pike has been instrumental in some of history's most important battles, and the pikeman is an expert in the use of this deadly, and highly effective weapon. Combining aspects of the most disciplined formation fighter with the canny skill of a master duelist, the pikeman is a warrior at home facing off against the charge of a mounted knight or mounting a charge himself, with 12 feet of sharpened steel to lead the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So follow the example of Alexander the Great, or the Scots at Bannockburn, and give your next fighter some serious reach with Blackdirge Publishing and Master at Arms: Pikeman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Master at Arms - Pikeman includes 7 pages of new d20 material, which includes the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A historical look at the longspear/pike&lt;br/&gt;     Author's design notes&lt;br/&gt;     The pikeman prestige class&lt;br/&gt;     A new exotic weapon, the sarissa&lt;br/&gt;     Gyrok 'The Steel Bull&amp;quot;, a powerful minotaur mercenary and pikeman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
