			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Look for the marine animals shown on the two cards and point them out at the same time! If you do it before the other players, you are rewarded with an animal figurine. Comes with a double-sided game board consisting of giant puzzle pieces which can be put together differently each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players turn over two cards depicting marine animals. Players must find pictures depicted in both cards from the board and place their fingers on the pictures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First player to do this is rewarded with an animal figurine. If both cards show a treasure chest, the player also gets a treasure chest. First player to reach five animals or two treasure chests wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is assembled from pieces, so it changes between games. The tiles are double-sided: one side is plain, the other filled with more detail, making it harder to find the pictures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
