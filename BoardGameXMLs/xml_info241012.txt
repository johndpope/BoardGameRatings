			<description>Word Mines, the party game that makes you and your friends watch your dirty, dirty mouths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, teams dive into their deviant minds by guessing words to score points. The Cluegiver dishes out clues, but they must bite their tongue and avoid using any of the ever-seductive, forbidden words. Put your friends to shame by being on the team with the most points scored at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If teachers said you wouldn't amount to much, now is your time to earn that gold star.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
