			<description>This is game #14 in the Games on Half a Checkerboard Series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, players try to either get their pieces into one contiguously connected group or reduce the number of enemy pieces to one.  This game is a hybrid of Groups and Lines of Action, on a smaller board and utilizing shifting lines of pieces.  As players shift pieces, they may end up pushing pieces of either player off the board, and out of play.  This reducing of pieces is a double-edged sword, as it both weakens a player, but also pushes them closer to possibly winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
