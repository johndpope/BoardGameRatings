			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an extremely rare Milton Bradley game from WWII. The International Game Database lists its publish date as 1942.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to gain the most points over 5 games played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First Player is chosen by roll of the dice.  Each player in turn rolls two dice and moves 2 tanks.  One tanks move the number of spaces indicated by one die and the other tank moves the number of spaces indicated by the second die.  If you only have 1 tank left then you can move the number of spaces indicated on either of the die or the total of both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may move in any direction except diagonally.  You cannot move forward and then backward in the same move but you can move over the same square repeated as your move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you land on an enemy tank with an exact move you capture the tank.  Each captured tank is worth 5 points and winning a game is also worth 5 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
