			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the future everyone will be perfect, no one will suffer from hunger or desease. At least, that is what those above you want you to believe. In truth, in the gigantic city of the Mega-Complex is a secret war between mega-corps and other groups of power. Mutants, also called teratomorphs, work as contractors for them, doing their dirty jobs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Disgenesia you will play as one of this teratomorphs. You'll have amazing matations, but also, you will be rejected by the eugenic society of the Mega-Complex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is an appealing setting for all the cyberpunk fans, where cybernetic implants are replaced by mutations and genetic augmentations. It presents an easy to learn, dynamic and complete game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
