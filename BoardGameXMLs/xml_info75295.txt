							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Naval Thunder: Rise of the Battleship</name>
									
			<description>This 48-page expansion to the top selling Naval Thunder: Clash of Dreadnoughts core rules covers pre-dreadnought era combat during the Russo-Japanese War (1904 - 1905).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The addition of pre-dreadnought era combat to the Naval Thunder line adds a whole new tactical angle to the existing Clash of Dreadnoughts rules. With neither the speed nor the weapons range of their World War I era cousins, pre-engagement maneuver becomes critical, and once the battle is joined it's a brutal affair conducted at &amp;quot;knife fighting&amp;quot; distance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in Naval Thunder: Rise of the Battleship are the rules changes necessary to the core Clash of Dreadnoughts rules to recreate exciting pre-dreadnought battles on your tabletop. It also includes fleet lists and data cards for the Russian and Japanese Imperial navies, two historical scenarios, The Battle of the Yellow Sea, and The Battle of Tsushima and an updated quick-reference guide reflecting the rules changes so you can jump right into the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All data cards in Rise of the Battleship are completely compatible with Clash of Dreadnoughts and other Naval Thunder releases.  Included with the dowloads is an optional MS Excel tool that allows you to select and print data cards in seconds.  Instructions for using Rise of the Battleship with other Naval Thunder products are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
