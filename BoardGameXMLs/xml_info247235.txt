			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ran out of adversaries and loot to throw at your players? If so, this digest-type sourcebook contains a treasure trove of new material that can be used to spice up your adventures in The Frontier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Apostle: A new psionic class focused on healing and manipulating biological forces. Just the companion you need in the dangerous wilderness of Prometheus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psychic formulas: Loads of recipes that the Apostle can use to craft potent cakes and shakes imbued with psionic energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worms of the desert: The worm-like Skalixi are the undisputed rulers of Prometheus' deserts. These are no mere fish-bait; each of these 6 new creatures will offer plenty of challenge to your players at various levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steel titans: There's no better armor than power armor! Protect yourself with 7 new medium and heavy strength-enhancing models, from the practical Intrepid to the domineering Warmonger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relics of another age: The devices left behind by the mysterious Prometheans are probably the greatest treasure once can find in the ruins scattered across the Frontier. Discover 9 Promethean artifacts, along with simple rules on how to understand and use ancient alien technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
