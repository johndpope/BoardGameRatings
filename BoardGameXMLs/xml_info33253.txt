			<description>Those delightfully mixed-up creatures, the Wuzzles, and their enchanted island of Wuz are just a wish away when you play this race game with the towering 3-D mountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wuzzles have been invited to a party, but unfortunately, their gifts have become as mixed up as the Wuzzles.  Bits and pieces of their presents have been scattered all over the gameboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you tunnel in and out of the 3-D mountain, put together a complete gift, avoid Croc and the Creepasaurs, and be the first to arrive at the party?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
