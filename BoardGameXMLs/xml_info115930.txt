							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mr. Turnip&#039;s Aerial Rings</name>
									
			<description>Hoopla version, where you try to land your rings on parts od Mr. Turnip's body. On the board that the Mr. Turnip figure sits, there are also scoring areas, four with a positive score, two with a negative score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Turnip was created by puppeteer Joy Laurey (credited in the top left corner of the box lid), for the children's programme, Whirligig. The show was a Saturday, fortnightly, BBC TV children's programme, broadcast at 5pm. It ran from November 1950 to 1956. It was the first TV variety show specifically for children and was broadcast live from the studios in Lime Grove. Not many people owned TV sets in those early years, but those that did usually opened their homes to others, especially when children's programmes featured. Virtually the whole country watched this one and only TV channel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
