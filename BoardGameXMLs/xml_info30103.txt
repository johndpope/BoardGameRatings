			<description>The object of this abstract game is to place five tokens of one color in a row in any direction on a special 12 by 12 game board grid or to force your opponent into three &amp;quot;traps&amp;quot; -- the twenty red squares on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four-player version of the game involves team play while the three-player version involves one player alternatively playing against the other two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;100 points for completing a five-in-a-row formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other bonus scoring include the following:&lt;br/&gt;     100 points for completing a five-in-a-row formation with 10 tokens or less.&lt;br/&gt;     50 points for completing a five-in-a-row formation within the pink square.&lt;br/&gt;     50 points for forcing your opponent into 3 traps.&lt;br/&gt;     20 points for forcing your opponent into 2 traps.&lt;br/&gt;     10 points for forcing your opponent into 1 trap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was manufactured by Wales Games Systems, Inc., a division of Wales-Strippit Corporation in North Tonawanda, New York, USA.  It was later slightly modified to fit in with the western theme of Wales Game Systems' other games, having a cowboy hat added to the drawing of Joe and becoming &amp;quot;Tagalong Cowboy Joe,&amp;quot; a &amp;quot;64-32 Ranch Game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
