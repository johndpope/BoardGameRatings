			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All has not been well in Mistmoore since our last visit. The spells and blessings that keep the roads safe have been failing and their magic turning wild and feral in the mist. The worst spot along the old road is a section that was treacherous even when the spells hold, the Devil&amp;rsquo;s Ditch, and things have only gotten worse. Those tasked with protecting the roads are going mad, the mayors for the villages of the moor are trying to find a solution and there is a revolt spreading among the red caps that live near the wells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
