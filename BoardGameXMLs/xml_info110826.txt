			<description>Puff foam marbles through archways&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A somewhat different dexterity game - Pustekugel is played on the floor, you must puff the foam marble along a self-set-up track, either against another player or team or on your own against the clock. In a game against an opponent or opposing team only the cards showing three or less archways are used. You draw a card and then in turn players puff the ball through the archways. If you are the first to reach the starting point, you get the card. If you have the highest score from your cards after a pre-set number of rounds you win the game. If you race the clock you puff the marble along the track on your own, the fasted receives the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
