			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The background story of the Mystery of the Mummy! takes place in Hamburg, the most famous port of the German empire, in the year 1912. The harbour surroundings and the atmospheric and cultural sceneries are all a reflection of this fascinating city. And this is where the crime took place - the crime which you must solve!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game gives you several aids to help you unravel the mystery:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- For your support there is Wilhelm, your chauffeur. He&lt;br/&gt;will safely take you to the 186 places in the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- In your hotel room you may use the telephone with which&lt;br/&gt;you can gain valuable information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Several restaurants provide you with the pleasures in&lt;br/&gt;life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore Hamburg! You have five exciting days!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beside the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; adventure there are several action-sequences which bring about some changes in the game. For example; you have to salvage important exhibits from the bottom of the lake; you can also play around in a laboratory; you get information regarding criminological exhibits (blood and poison proofs, etc.) in the library. You will find the necessary chemicals in the chemist's shop...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have a map of Hamburg dated 1912. This will make orientation easier. Every building on the map has a number which corresponds to the number in the address book. Each number is unique. The address and telephone book contain the names of all the inhabitants with addresses and, where appropriate, the telephone number. To get to the chosen place you need only input the appropriate number of the house, shop, building, institution etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
