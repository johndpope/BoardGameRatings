			<description>Subtitled: &amp;quot;18th Century Riot Rules. Being a description of the actions of sev'ral and disparate Stout Defenders of Liberty struggling against the Ungodly Forces of Insurrection.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set of miniatures rules addresses conflicts between riotous civilian gangs and the police and military forces attempting to subdue them. The game is played between two groups of players and is moderated by an umpire. One group of players represents the forces of order, and the other group portrays the unruly civilians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game may be played with 6mm or 15mm figures. The game scale is 1 mm=1 yard and each turn equals 5-10 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
