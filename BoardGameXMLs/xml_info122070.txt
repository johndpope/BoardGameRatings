			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;French fantasy RPG. The game can be played by one player, or two players using a vertically split screen. The game can be played either cooperatively or competitively. The game system uses classic character classes (wizard, warrior, paladin, assassin, elf, priest) with different stat scores (the stats are strength, agility, intelligence, luck, hit points, magic points), and the characters get better as they gain experience points. The back of the box says (translated from French):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;XIIIth Century&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Heprena is dying, you must help my people!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This message will turn your peaceful ligfe upside down. Heprena... The glorious city and home of your former tutor, Merlux, Master Enchanter. Leaving your enchanted forest, you go into the unknown... Before you find Merlux, your quest will be filled with challenges:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- labyrinths,&lt;br/&gt; - deadly pirates,&lt;br/&gt; - bloodthirsty brigands,&lt;br/&gt; - gargoyles and zombies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll hear from his mouth of the Evil that rules over Heprena, and the nature of your mission...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
