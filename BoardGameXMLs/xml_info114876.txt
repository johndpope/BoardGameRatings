			<description>The buttons are having a party, they always pair up in twos, either with the same colour or the same shape. One white button is strung onto the bracelet, all other buttons go into the bag. All players in turn draw buttons from the bag until they have five, one button is placed in the middle of the table. In your turn you may discard a button when it has the same shape or the same color as the button in the middle. The old button is taken out of the game. If you have no button to discard, you draw a button from the bag and may try to feel for the shape beforehand. White Lucky Buttons can be placed anytime. If you are the first to discard all your buttons you win and get the bracelet to wear, if you win the next round, you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
