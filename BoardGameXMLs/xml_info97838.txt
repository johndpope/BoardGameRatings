			<description>Highly collectable detective game from this famous British author of detective and horror stories. The rule book outlines a detailed scenario in which a murder has taken place and one of six infamous criminals must be to blame.  The players are detectives and move around a map of Britain and in various towns get to look at one of the cards which may help provide an alibi for one of the suspects, advance the investigation further or merely cause a delay.  When enough information has been gathered a player can race back to the town the murderer is in and arrest him to win.  Nice system which ensures it plays differently each time.  Includes metal detective figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
