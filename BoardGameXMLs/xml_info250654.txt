							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Last Days of Athobrae</name>
									
			<description>Last Days of Athobrae is a competitive, turn-based, resource-gathering strategy game.  Players take on the mantle of one of five unique civilizations trying to collect the resources that will allow them to build a spaceship and escape their dying planet. Each player's turn consists of 3 actions that allow them to navigate the planet, gather resources, build technology, and attack other players.  Once all players have taken their turn, it is time for the doom phase, when world-convulsions shake things up!  In a race against the world's demise and opposing players, first one to build and fuel their ship is the winner.  If the world falls completely to pieces before anyone can escape, the game ends with no winner.  Can you survive...?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
