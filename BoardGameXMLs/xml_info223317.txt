			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reboot is set in the year 22nd century in which mankind has embraced cybernetic technology which is used to traverse the net and found paradises but these paradises came at a cost. With everything, people found ways to manipulate this new technology by taking over peoples bodies and using them as pawns. A small portion of the Human race shunned the advances in technology and changed to become known as psychics who could wield indescribable powers. With advances in technology also came the ability to venture towards the stars and with this technology man found other races some coming in peace, some forming alliances and many wanting to destroy the human race and recolonize Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This item usually is distributed as a .ZIP archive containing the 50-page PDF game document and four full-color, one-page PDF action tables.  The action tables are intended for print-and-play use, but have unusual paper sizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
