			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Job Requires a Special Set of Skills!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A spacefarer&amp;rsquo;s life is a difficult one, fraught with danger. She is surrounded by hazardous environments, encounters strange and hostile alien species, and must often make do with outdated, or even glitch, equipment. If one wants to live long adventuring among the stars, it&amp;rsquo;s important to be the best that one can be. The Spacefarer&amp;rsquo;s Digest series contains new player options and content, from character themes and races, to archetypes, feats, spells, and more, allowing every traveler among the stars to reach their maximum potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volume features a collection of new archetypes, all of which are linked to heists, whether criminal or otherwise. Included are the con artists, a master manipulator and face of the group, the exit strategist, who specializes in mobility and escapes, the mastermind, a tactician and planner who can support the entire team with contingencies and back-up schemes, and the thief, which specializes in gaining access to places and things they aren&amp;rsquo;t authorized to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
