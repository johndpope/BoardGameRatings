			<description>In Doomed you play a fallen angel who has sold its soul to Mephistopheles for a promise that was never repaid. Now you are exploring Hell to destroy the prince and take his throne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will face monsters, bosses, and Mephistopheles himself. In order to defeat monsters and escape events, you'll roll dice, with items, potions and skills boosting your chances of reaching Mephistopheles. Thankfully you're not alone when fighting against the boss as those are cooperative fights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
