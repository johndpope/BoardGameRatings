			<description>(From the back Cover)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the journal of Dana Washington&lt;br/&gt;21 January 2036:&lt;br/&gt;The concentration camp is finished.  I took a great risk going out to see it myself.  Every bit of cover withing 500 yards has been cleared away so no one can get close.  I must contact other mutants; with our strength combined, we can fight back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10 February 2036:&lt;br/&gt;Roger (he calls himself &amp;quot;Heatwave&amp;quot; now) left yesterday to pick up a power converter.  Two hours later, the police threw up a cordon around the whole neighborhood.  Every street and alley is covered with a roadblock.  Roger should have been back before dawn this morning.  I fear the sentinels have him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;19 February 2036:&lt;br/&gt;This morning I established contact with a group of five mutants living beneath the old water tower.  They have enough food and water to last two weeks, plus four plasma generators scavenged from wrecked sentinels.  We are almost strong enough to strike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;17 March 2036:&lt;br/&gt;Today I met our human informant and he delivered the technical readouts on the sentinels' surveillance base.  Everyone is ready; we attack the base tonight.  Homo superior is about to make his entrance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game accessory is designed for use with the MARVEL SUPER HEROES Advanced Set.  IT includes a 32-page book and a 33&amp;quot; X 22 1/2&amp;quot; full color map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
