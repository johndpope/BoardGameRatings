							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gratuitous Space Battles: The Order</name>
									
			<description>The second expansion for Gratuitous Space Battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What The Order Expansion Pack Contains&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10 New ships. 4 Cruisers 3 Frigates and 3 fighters, all in a new graphical style by the same artist who did the original GSB artwork. The order ships use tractor beams to keep the different components together. Girders are so 2450's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 New weapon types:  The radiation gun does impact damage plus ongoing internal radiation damage as its effects devastate your ship from the inside. Nuclear missiles provide the same entertainment in missile form. Firefly rockets give normal cruiser rockets a boost of speed, and lastly, cunning anti-fighter limpet mines latch on to incoming fighters and drag them down to speeds where everyone can take pot shots at them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New ship bonuses. The order ships have pretty poor engines, but those big green throbbing powerplants kick out more juice on order ships. What could you design given more power and less speed? The order is your opportunity to find out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 New Scenarios. Two maps for you to fight against the order, One is a normal map, but with the fun and games of a nice aesthetically pleasing 3D style asteroid field (does not affect gameplay but looks cool), and the other is a 'survival' mode match where you play last ship standing and try to score higher than other players in the global high score table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
