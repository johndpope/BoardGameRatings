			<description>The better you do, the tougher it gets!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a 6x6 grid with pathways between and outside the grid points (&amp;quot;forts&amp;quot;).  At either end of the board, the starting spaces abutt the seven pathways.  The object is to form a row of four contiguous forts, horizontally, vertically or diagonally.  You move a &amp;quot;knight&amp;quot; by entering one of the four surrounding pathways (there is only one possible pathway when the knight is in a starting position), sliding along it in a straight line as far as you wish, then hop off the pathway into an adjacent empty fort.  You must use one of the four &amp;quot;outside&amp;quot; knights to open the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon winning a &amp;quot;joust&amp;quot;, you mark the win using a knight, so you're handicapped for the next jousts.  The first player to win 3 jousts wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
