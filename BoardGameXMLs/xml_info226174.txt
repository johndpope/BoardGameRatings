			<description>The game is played on a slanted grid using three pieces to a player, representing viking longships; the goal is to cross the playing field to your opponent's starting spaces the fastest. Each turn a die is rolled, with an odd result usually resulting in moving one ship one space, and an even result meaning a lost turn. Opposing ships block but do not capture each other. Some spaces require a specific die result to enter, and other spaces are effectively forbidden, sending a piece back to the start if for some unexplained reason you should enter them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is nominally for 2-4 players, representing the vikings of Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark, but it would not be fair to play with 3, since the board is effectively divided in half and with 4 players the two pairs interact very weakly except for the racing aspect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no year of publication, but the Alga logo (or lack of one) suggests the 1940s or 1950s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
