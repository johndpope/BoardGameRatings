							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jerusalem: The Horse</name>
									
			<description>The Builder is a new Action card for Jerusalem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just add the card to the basic Action card deck to play with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you play this Action card, place it under one of your squire who's inside one area of the game board. That Squire will have a Horse for the rest of the game. After the first step of phase 3 (The Tower of David), the Squire with the Horse may be moved anywhere on the game board (with the exception of blocked areas by Barons).&lt;br/&gt;Note 1: If an opponent plays &amp;quot;Turncoat&amp;quot;, the opponent takes also the Horse!&lt;br/&gt;Note 2: If that squire is removed from the game after a War event or he's killed (the new Assassin card), the card is removed too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
