			<description>Stalingrad &amp;rsquo;42 includes 42 scenarios covering three periods of the overall battle. There are ten individual scenarios covering the early fighting in July and August. However, the Game focus is the Uranus Campaign and here there are 23 scenarios which include a full historical Campaign covering the period of encirclement with the relief effort, as well as a short campaign covering just the encirclement. We&amp;rsquo;ve also come up with a number of historically plausible &amp;ldquo;What If&amp;rdquo; situations such as exploring an option that would see the Germans being permitted to retreat from the Volga when the danger was apparent, or if they had adopted a more logical (in hindsight) corset defense on their flanks with Germans divisions being interspersed with the Rumanians. Finally, there are nine December scenarios dealing with the encircled 6th Army and action along the Chir River.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
