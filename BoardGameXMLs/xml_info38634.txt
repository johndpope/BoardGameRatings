							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arnold&#039;s Finest Hour</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;Everyone remembers that Benedict Arnold was a traitor during the Revolutionary War. What is often forgotten is that prior to his treachery he was America's finest general. Perhaps his greatest display of leadership and courage was at the second battle of Saratoga, also known as Bemis Heights. It was at this battle that Arnold led a successful American attack against a British fort. His victory eventually forced General Burgoyne to surrender his army, and gave the French the encouragement they needed to declare war on the British.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale miniature figures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules. The objective for the American forces is to capture one of the two redoubts at the British end of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
