			<description>The plasma burst exploded too close for Chaves to feel comfortable and so he kicked in his jet booster to move to a new location before the enemy could pin point his position any closer. As he leaped into the sky, the booster jets sending him high over the alien trees, Sgt Chaves made a quick recon of the battlefield as it appear below him. Sensors marked on his heads up display where each of the other four in his squad where located and where the enemy troopers where positioned, or as best he could tell from what his scanners were telling him anyways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As he leaped over the terrain, he became exposed and incoming fire began to pelt off his armor. Best to stay low he figured as he hit the ground running. Over his communication link the lieutenant was yelling at Private Jones to lay down suppression fire on the enemy set up on the low hill to the right. Another day in the Core, Chaves sighed, as he headed off to that same hill to kill more of the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Battle Armor, the second Mini Game by Bad Baby. Wars in the future will be fought by heavily armored warriors. Powered Battle Suits will rule to battlefield as each man can pack the firepower of a battalion. Mobile, heavily armored and capable of laying down a path of destruction like no other weapon ever made, the Powered Battle Suit will rule the future of warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Battle Armor you take control of a single man, or a squad of battle suit armed warriors, as they fight their endless and bloody wars in the future. Everything you need to play the game is included, rules, full color counters, map boards and terrain tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast, easy to play and quick to learn, Battle Armor will supply you with endless hours of fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PDF can be found at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.wargamedownloads.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.wargamedownloads.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.rpgnow.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
