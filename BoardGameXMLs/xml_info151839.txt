			<description>The Cars Game System combines gaming and modeling: Players first assemble their favorite characters from the Disney/Pixar movie Cars, then they race them head-to-head on a customizable race track! Players must maneuver their cars for the best position and collect special bonus tokens that give them an extra boost during the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cars: Cool Twists Starter Game Set includes two character models (1:43 scale, some assembly required) complete with stickers: McQueen and Francesco. Also included are modular track tiles, special ability tokens, character cards, and dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be expanded by adding additional cars from other model kits (sold separately), allowing up to 6 players total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
