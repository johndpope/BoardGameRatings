			<description>Midnight in the city of New York. It's raining. Three miles away from each other, two men make exactly the same decision at exactly the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One is Daredevil, the red-costumed fighter for justice, who uses his uncanny senses to fight evil where he finds it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other is Kingpin, the pinstripe-clad warrior, who has followed his own code of ethics while fighting and clawing his way to the top of a criminal empire more powerful than many small nations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each has decided to eliminate the other in a duel to the death on the streets of New York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player is Daredevil. The other, Kingpin. Each has his own book of scenarios and choices in this 1 on 1 Adventure Gamebooks episode of the Marvel Super Heroes Adventure series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
