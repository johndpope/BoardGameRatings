			<description>An enjoyable dice game for the whole family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little wooden locos try to find the fastest way from the station of &amp;quot;Hinterstein&amp;quot; to the destination station of &amp;quot;Moosbach&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to achieve this the players throw two dice.&lt;br/&gt;6 crossings on the board are covered with special switch tiles, each one fixed to a roll of doubles. &lt;br/&gt;A seventh card is also provided.&lt;br/&gt;If a player rolls a double, he can exchange the switch card with the seventh card, turning it as he likes.&lt;br/&gt;Some places and cards have a stop bar printed on them.&lt;br/&gt;If a loco rams a bar, it is turned 180 degrees, now proceeding in the opposite direction. The player also now has the right to turn any of the 6 switches on the board as he chooses to do.&lt;br/&gt;Play can become tricky, as it is possible to be captured in an endless loop where relief only comes with the roll of a double.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fun for gamers of every age, superb artwork of the board add to the flair of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
