			<description>Abstract strategy game on 8x8 board. 16 square pieces per player with pointers on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces can slide. The less pointers on the piece, the less directions you can move in, although with high speed. The more pointers, the more directions you can move in, but at slower speed.&lt;br/&gt;It is also possible to jump when pointers are aligned between pieces. If a jump ends on an opposing piece it is taken. A piece is also taken when all its pointers are blocked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces start at your own two back rows. The player who reaches the opposite end row first with two of his pieces in adjacent fields wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
