			<description>Game contains 4 pagodas and 16 puzzle pieces, along with a spinner.  To start, all puzzle pieces are placed face down in the center and each player takes one pagoda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, the player spins the spinner.  If it lands on black, you turn over a black piece from the pile.  If it lands on white, you turn over a white piece from the pile.  If the upturned piece matches the player's pagoda color, they keep it.  If not, it is shown to all players and returned to the center, white or black side up.  If the spinner lands on Mushu, the player must trade their pagoda with another player.  First player to complete their pagoda with all 4 pieces wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
