			<description>In dystopic 1930s, industrial revolution pushed to the limit the fossil resource exploitation and no more energy sources but the powerful and unlimited hydroelectric energy is now available to fulfill the thirst for power of the massive mechanical and engineering unstoppable progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barrage is a resource management and strategic placement game, in which players will compete to build their majestic dams, raise them to increase their storing capacity of precious water, and deliver all the potential power through pressure tunnel connected to powerhouse energy turbines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player represents one of the international companies who are gathering machineries, innovative patents, and brilliant engineers to claim the best location to capture and exploit the water power of a contested Alpine region crossed by rivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barrage includes two innovative and challenging mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;The Construction wheel has to be managed by players to carefully plan their actions and handle their machineries, since both your action tokens and resources will be stored on the wheel and will come back only after a full wheel round is completed. The more you will construct and perform maintenance on your wheel, the earlier you will get back your resources and actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Water flow on the rivers depicted on the board is a shared and contested resource - players will have to intercept and store as much of the water as they can, build dams (upstream dams are expensive but can block part of the water before the downstream dams), raise their dams to increase capacity, and build long tunnels to divert water up to their powerhouses. Water is never consumed (its flow is just used to produce energy) and released in the rivers, therefore you have to place strategically your dams to recover water diverted by you or other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 5 rounds players will fulfill power requirement represented by a common competitive power track and to meet specific request of personal contracts. At the same time, by placing a limited number of Engineers, they will attempt to increase their machineries, to acquire new and more efficient construction actions and to build and activate special unique effect buildings to customize their own developing strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
