			<description>The game has been developed by Identity Games in Rotterdam for Robeco as a promotional game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to accumulate several victory points. Points are scored in several ways: &lt;br/&gt;1. By investing a full 100% (in steps of 25%) in a economic sector. &lt;br/&gt;2. With special strategy cards worth 1 point. When you land on a strategy field you can pick up 1 card.&lt;br/&gt;3. By investing in different areas at the same time around the world. &lt;br/&gt;4. By investing in all sectors at the same time (regardless of area)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game shares several similarities with Monopoly, like roll-and-move, buying assets, completing sets, drawing cards when landed on certain fields on the board. There are also some differences, for example you can takeover someone's assets when you land on his field and he has no full set yet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
