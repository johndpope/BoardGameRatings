			<description>Back to the Future: The Game is a graphic adventure video game based on the Back to the Future film franchise. The game is being developed by Telltale Games who has licensed the Back to the Future elements from Universal Studios. Bob Gale, the screenwriter for the three films, is assisting Telltale in developing the game's story, while both Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd have allowed Telltale to use their likenesses within the game for the lead characters Marty McFly and Doc Brown, respectively. Lloyd will also be providing the voice work for Doc Brown's character while new talent AJ LoCascio will be the voice of Marty McFly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place six months after the events of the film Back to the Future Part III and sees Marty McFly, the protagonist of the series, trying to adjust to a life without his best friend, scientist Doctor Emmett &amp;quot;Doc&amp;quot; Brown.[3] As Doc left everything behind after leaving to an unknown time period, the bank has foreclosed on his home and sells off his property.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Back to the Future: The Game&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
