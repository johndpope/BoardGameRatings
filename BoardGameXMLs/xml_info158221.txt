			<description>Swarm! Anti-Body Assault is a competitive-cooperative science fiction game for two to four players. A breach between dimensions has opened at the edge of the galaxy, and the Anti-Bodies, a race of horrible interdimensional space monsters, are spilling out and threatening to consume everything in their path if left unchecked. That's where you come in! You and a couple friends can take control of one of fifteen giant robots from all across the Milky Way, equip an arsenal of futuristic weaponry, and mow down the horde. And although everyone is working towards the same goal, killing some enemies will bring you more recognition from others when it's time for the Senator to hand out the medals...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay consists of rounds of play, called waves, in which a random number of enemy cards are dealt out of a deck to each player. Then, players take turns making attack rolls using up to three different colored dice, which correspond to enemy types (for example, red dice can only deal damage to red enemies, etc.). After all attacks have been made by players, any surviving enemies counterattack, then remain in play during the next wave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal is to work with your teammates to deplete the 100 card enemy deck entirely, but in addition to that each enemy a player kills is worth anywhere from one to six points. So, while players are competing against each other for points, they are also required to work together to prevent a total party loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
