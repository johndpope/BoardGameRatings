			<description>In this trivia game, on your turn you will answer your question with 1 to 3 possible answers. The other players then vote using their cards whether the correct answer is #1, #2, #3, or &amp;quot;None of the Above.&amp;quot; The active player gets 3-5 points if he's right, more points if he wrote fewer answers. The other players get 2 points if they guess correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If players don't feel they can accurately guess, they can &amp;quot;cheat.&amp;quot; They can look at the answer, get only 1 point that round, and must include the correct answer in the three they write on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
