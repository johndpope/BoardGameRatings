							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pact: Agents of the C6</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Pact: Agents of the C6, players take on the role of agents in service to the council of six. The Pact uses four core systems; the words of power, gauges, mutations and accomplishment points.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;The default setting for this game is the modern world with one major difference; monsters, ghosts, demons, angels, and all other supernatural beings are real. Some of these other beings have used humans as food, guinea pigs, and even husks to walk upon the earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This intriguing game uses some very unusual mechanics for characterization.  Characters have &amp;quot;Gauges&amp;quot; which are loosely analogous to Attributes, but vary during play.  Characters also select a &amp;quot;Path&amp;quot; which is somewhat like a Class in concept, though not very similar in function.  Finally, characters have a unique blend of special qualities which are something like Traits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
