							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">300: March to Glory</name>
									
			<description>300: March to Glory is based on the comic book mini-series 300 by Frank Miller and the movie of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;The game begins shortly before the Battle of Thermopylae where the player takes on the role as King Leonidas, fighting through scenes from both movie and book. Armour can be upgraded, as can weapons and stats. The player battles through hordes of Persian warriors including slaves, spearmen, archers, Immortals, Persian champions, two Persian generals, Mardonius and Hydarnes. The action is furthered when the Spartan army forms a phalanx formation. This is used to fight not only even more Persians, but giant beasts such as elephants as well. As the game keeps progressing, Leonidas is able to wield two swords and the ability to change between weapon styles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;300: March to Glory&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
