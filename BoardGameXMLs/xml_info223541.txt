							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chinese Juggler</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cassette inlay&lt;br/&gt;PLAYING&lt;br/&gt;Your turn to be the Juggler!&lt;br/&gt;You must get all eight plates to spin simultaneously and to do this requires skill and strategy. Approach the table from from one side and by pressing the fire button you can pick up the plate, remember to push the joystick in the direction which the Juggler is moving.&lt;br/&gt;Now approach the rod from the side positioning the Juggler with his feet at the same level as the bottom of the rod and by pressing the fire button again the plate will begin spinning. Should a plate slow down and begin to wobblethe Juggler must be lead back to the rod and rotate the plate to keep it going.&lt;br/&gt;You can also do real juggling tricks like tossing up the plates and catching them, this come useful for they change colour at random and the different colours rate different scores. [The best bet is the white plate which has the maximum points and keep spinning for the longest time].&lt;br/&gt;When you develop real skill you can take the darker plates to the back of the stage and, by pressing the fire button, get rid of them. All eight plates up and spinning gets you to the next, even more difficult screen.&lt;br/&gt;Good Luck!</description>
