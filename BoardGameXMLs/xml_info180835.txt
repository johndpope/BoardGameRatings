							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fragrant Tower</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The squat, austere form of the Fragrant Tower is not much to look upon as it sits atop Spellbarrow Hill.But visitors soon find the tower to be aptly named, as they are greeted by a myriad of tantalizing scents emanating from the tower&amp;rsquo;s rooftop garden and surrounding rose hedges.  Home to the wizard Tasril and his small household, The Fragrant Tower is an obvious destination for travellers with coin to spend on items of magic, or those who seek to acquire some of Tasril&amp;rsquo;s enchanted perfumes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From time to time, or so the locals claim, the sweet-scented breezes from the tower carry traces of fouler odours. Widely believed to be the by-product of the wizard&amp;rsquo;s magical experiments, there are those who wonder if the perfumed halls conceal an ominous secret and if something sinister lurks in the depths of the tower dungeons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Places of Power are short, richly detailed supplements that each present a flavoursome locale such as a remote temple, borderland fort or reclusive wizard&amp;rsquo;s demesne. Ready to be plugged into almost any home campaign, each instalment can be used as a waystop on the road to adventure, the home of a powerful NPC or even as a mini-adventure site in its own right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
