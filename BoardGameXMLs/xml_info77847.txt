							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Bomberman 2</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Super Bomberman 2 is the second of five video games in the Bomberman series developed by Hudson Soft to be released for the Super Nintendo. It is the only Super Bomberman game without a 2-Player Story Mode.&lt;br/&gt;  Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;  The gameplay consists of walking through maze-like areas filled with monsters with a goal of opening the gate leading to the next area. Playing as a bomberman, the player can lay bombs  to destroy all of the monsters, which will subsequently open the gate. Destroying blocks in the maze may uncover useful items including remote control bombs, accelerators, and hearts. There are five levels total and at the end of each is a boss. Each boss is faced first alone in an arena  until he or she has been defeated. The boss then retreats back to another arena where the play will face him or her in a personalized machine. After the boss is defeated, the player will continue to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;  Multiplayer:&lt;br/&gt;  In Battle Mode, one to four players can face off against one another in one of ten arenas designed specifically for multiplayer play. Matches can be customized as battle royal  matches or as team matches. Besides the regular items found in singleplayer mode, the glove (allowing Bomberman to pick up and toss bombs) and speed increases can be found in multiplayer. A special option called G-Bomber can also be enabled allowing the winner of each match to be given a special item to begin the next match with and also to be colored golden.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super Bomberman 2,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
