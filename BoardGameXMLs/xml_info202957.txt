			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aside from what is printed on the cards, there are no pre-existing rules to follow.  In fact, many of the rules have been left ambiguous on purpose; just as each population has created their own method for their oral traditions, each Village will develop their own set of house rules to handle the situations that are not explicitly spelled out.  These rules will then be passed on and modified from group to group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nearly the entire document is intended as a print-and-play component.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
