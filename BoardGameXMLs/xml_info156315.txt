			<description>In times of greed pervades the lives of the Goddesses, the war of no longer inevitable. Five Goddess consisting of earth, water, fire, air, and ether agreed to compete for &amp;quot;sixth element&amp;quot;. Elements which can not only increase strength but also can make the Goddess of Life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Sanskrit, Panchadevi means five goddesses, this is a card game that uses dice were also in play. So the factor of luck and strategy, interplay to be a winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will play one of the five goddesses and fight each other to gain victory points (VP) by collecting card of elements. Each card has a different VP and each player was released to collect cards of any type of element. However, if the player manages to collect cards of the same elements as his goddess then amount of VP of that card mentioned multiplied by two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will be more challenging because if the player collects more than three cards of the same elements, then VP of a number of card mentioned has aborted and each card will only be worth 1VP. At the end of the game, the whole of VP will be totaled and the player with the highest VP is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
