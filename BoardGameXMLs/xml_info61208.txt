			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Inner Circle debuts its 4th Edition support with our Races of Violet Dawn product line. Our first entry in the series focuses on the skarren, a new playable race for 4th Edition campaigns that can easily be dropped into any setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rough and bestial, skarren were born from the spilled blood of the war god Kr&amp;uuml;g. Blind to their origins, they live hard lives that flow with the cycles of nature and the elements. The true focus of their existence, however, is combat. In all their travels, it is the thing they seek most, and their ambition is little more than to fight, mate and die gloriously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this PDF are the complete rules for adding these brutal warriors to your game, 8 new racial feats, a racial paragon path called the Blood Reaver, and 5 new skarren weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Races of Violet Dawn is presented in the same full color art style we are known for and includes a light ink version for easy printing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
