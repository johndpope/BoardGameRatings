Built in collaboration with NASA, the game gives players an authentic experience of space, immersing them in the tasks performed on the ISS, thousands of kilometres above earth. It is built in collaboration with astronauts and the people who support and train them, providing players and simulation experts an exciting look at the authentic depiction of human spaceflight in Virtual Reality using readily accessible consumer technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
