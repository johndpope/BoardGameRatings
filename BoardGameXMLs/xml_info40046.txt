			<description>The publisher Dargaud usually releases comic books in France like Asterix or Lucky Luke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So this game is featuring the Wild West hero Lucky Luke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is outstandingly equipped with components.&lt;br/&gt;You have among others a stagecoach traveling around the outer track, a loco traveling the inner track, workers in two different colours, signals, road blocks, a lot of play money and last but not least hundreds of cardboard rail segments in 3 different colours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game is to connect the eastern and western borders of the USA.&lt;br/&gt;To achieve this you have to travel with your stagecoach in order to collect building material and to hire workers.&lt;br/&gt;These have to be delivered to your hometown, and from then on you can choose what to do with your dice roll: Move on with your stagecoach or move your loco on the inner board to build the rails in order to achieve your goal first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But beware: You have to maximize your money profits (railway building is expensive !!!) and to avoid your opponents who can rob your stagecoach or steal your stocks in hometown, because the loco can only transport as much as you have hired workers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And even further your opponents can hinder your track building by forcing to add bridges to your railway or to make your workers flee from your company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But one of the players can count for the help of the name-giving comic hero !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner is the first player to complete the track, build a second hometown and then travels back with his loco to his starting depot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
