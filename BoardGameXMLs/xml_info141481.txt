			<description>The Times Su Doku is a tile placement game which allows either solo puzzle solving or two player competitive game play. Su Doku (or Sudoku) is a mathematical puzzle which consists of a grid of 9 3x3 squares. The completed puzzle has the digits 1 to 9 in each 3x3 square and the digits 1 to 9 in each row and column in the grid. The game poses a number of partially complete grids which must be completed correctly and can be used in either the solo puzzle or two player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The solo mode allows a player to attempt to correctly complete a Su Doku. This function of the set is not technically a game and is actually solo puzzle solving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two player mode sees both players attempting to complete the same puzzle in the same grid. Players may place a tile as soon as they are sure that the placement is correct; there is no turn sequence. The players race to place as many correct tiles as possible before the whole puzzle is complete. The winning player is the one who placed the largest number of correct tiles in the puzzle, less the number of incorrect tiles which they placed. The tiles are double sided and are printed with a different colour on each side to allow players to identify which tiles were placed by which player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
