							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horticulturalists of the Wild West Gardens</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will take up the position of either Mankind or Plantkind in this game. The Wild west ain&amp;rsquo;t what it used to be and the plants are trying to take over. As a Horticulturalist, you are trying to stake your claims in towns and fields, battling those vicious plants and prevent them from taking over. As a plant you are trying to absorb as much land as possible before those soil stealing humans take it all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the Gardeners and the Plants have a different Ace in the hole. Whichever side of the slaw you come down on, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to pick your trick carefully. And while it mentioned on the cards, it&amp;rsquo;s worth mentioning here as well, Each character has a starter garden in addition to their character card. The plants are also considered garden cards, they are just smaller gardens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requires a custom card pack which is included as a print-and-play component.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
