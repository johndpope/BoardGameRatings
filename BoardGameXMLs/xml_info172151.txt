							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Valiant Universe RPG Comic Book Play Guide</name>
									
			<description>From the publishers webpage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your friends are sitting around talking about comic books, &amp;rsquo;cause that&amp;rsquo;s what we do, after all&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve just finished reading Harbinger #21 and are wondering about Peter Stanchek&amp;rsquo;s powers. The key phrase that you&amp;rsquo;re excitedly debating is from Peter: &amp;ldquo;You know &amp;hellip; it affects me pretty hard. Every time I scan someone. The homeless I wipe to keep rumors of your apparitions from spreading. All those Foundation members during Harada&amp;rsquo;s mind squall. Ax earlier today&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of you says, &amp;ldquo;Y&amp;rsquo;know, if I was Peter I&amp;rsquo;d simply anchor an invisibility shield to Monica Jim. Every time she leaves the Renegades&amp;rsquo; underground lair, Peter&amp;rsquo;s psionic energy spikes on. That keeps Monica Jim hidden while alerting Peter to potential trouble while she&amp;rsquo;s out. But this also gives her some leash so the kid doesn&amp;rsquo;t go stir crazy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another one of you says, &amp;ldquo;Nah, nothing in any of the comics says Peter can anchor his powers, much less have them kick off subconsciously like that. That&amp;rsquo;s going too far.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And another friend pipes up and says, &amp;ldquo;Yeah, I agree. Not to mention that doesn&amp;rsquo;t solve Peter&amp;rsquo;s problem of the psychic weight he&amp;rsquo;s carrying. If I was Peter, I would&amp;rsquo;ve figured out how Harada&amp;rsquo;s mind squall worked while it was scrambling all that brain juice. The comics have shown how fast he adapts, after all. Then, when he&amp;rsquo;s scanning and erasing memories, he generates, well, let&amp;rsquo;s call it a &amp;lsquo;mind bubble.&amp;rsquo; A subtle pressure of memories spread into a wide area&amp;mdash;a pressure valve relief sorta thing. Kicks off d&amp;eacute;j&amp;agrave; vu for anyone in a certain radius. But no one&amp;rsquo;s really hurt, no alarms sound, and Peter&amp;rsquo;s not getting crushed because he&amp;rsquo;s carrying the weight of everything.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A chorus of &amp;ldquo;Oh &amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s good&amp;rdquo; flows around the room. Except for the original guy, who mutters, &amp;ldquo;I still like my idea better.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who hasn&amp;rsquo;t enjoyed those thought experiments as we&amp;rsquo;ve all put our imaginations to work in great debates to answer the questions that come out of reading the best comics? Well, that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what Valiant Universe: The Roleplaying Game lets you do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is your chance to step in, suit up, and answer those questions for yourself! How would you do it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This comic provides another great example of how to roleplaying with your friends in the Valiant Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
