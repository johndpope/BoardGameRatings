							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Braindead Bimbo Barbarians</name>
									
			<description>from Saving the World in High Heels:&lt;br/&gt;Histories and legends are chock-a-bloc with stories of brave, strapping young men performing great deeds, guiding human progress forward and shaping civilization into what it is today. This is not a game about them; their time has passed on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Braindead Bimbo Barbarians you will take on the role of a skimpily-clad heroine straight from the canvas of Boris Vallejo or Frank Cho. You will tackle formidable challenges without the benefit of brilliant intellect, protective armor, or sensible shoes. You will vanquish ancient terrors, dethrone evil despots, and create a legacy that will be sung of for generations, all without smudging your makeup. The world doesn&amp;rsquo;t need Conan the Cimmerian or Ash from S-Mart; you&amp;rsquo;re better than that, you&amp;rsquo;re a total babe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BBB is a game for two to five players, with one player taking on the role of storyteller and referee (referred to as the Game Master or GM). All the remaining players are each responsible for a single protagonist character (referred to as a Heroine or Bimbo). In order to play, you will need a few things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Pencils and Paper&lt;br/&gt;     Three or more six-sided dice&lt;br/&gt;     Some poker chips&lt;br/&gt;     A sense of humor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment:&lt;br/&gt;This is a very early version of Busty Barbarian Bimbos prior to development for publication and subsequent retitling.  The file is watermarked &amp;quot;draft 0.3.5&amp;quot; and file metadata indicates the author as &amp;quot;Burrowowl&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
