							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mystic: A New Dungeon World Playbook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nothing stays the same way forever. Everything changes with time. Do not get attached to what exists. Instead, strive to be free from all attachments. To do so is the only way to free oneself from pain and obtain a higher state of being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mystic is a new playbook for Dungeon World for those who wish to play a martial artists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mystics do not use weapons, but, instead, form elaborate techniques of martial prowess by merging known tags together. Their years of physical training allow them to reduce the damage they take from strikes when unarmored and perform fantastic feats of acrobatics. Some may even dabble in the dark paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The training a mystic endures is not just focused on the physical. Mystics learn to see the universe in a new light and strive to uncover the mysteries of the world. They can learn to draw upon the inner energy known as Chi, free their mind from indecision and doubt, and master the gentle touch. Their wisdom may, one day, attract a student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This playbook comes in two, nearly-identical packages: an &amp;quot;old school&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;new school&amp;quot; version. The difference between these packages are that they use different terms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;old school&amp;quot; version uses the terms alignment and race like the core DW classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;new school&amp;quot; uses the terms drives and backgrounds (Styles, in this instance) as seen in many indie DW playbooks. Drives and backgrounds appeal to gamers who dislike the race/alignment restrictions in core DW playbooks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
