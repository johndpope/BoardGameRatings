			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harvest Moon: Magical Melody (牧場物語 しあわせの詩 for ワールド, Bokujō Monogatari: Shiawase no Uta for Wārudo, literally &amp;quot;Farm Story: Song/Poem of Happiness for World&amp;quot;) is a social simulation video game for the Nintendo GameCube developed by Marvelous Interactive. It is an updated version of Bokujō Monogatari: Shiawase no Uta (牧場物語 しあわせの詩), which was only released in Japan. The updated GameCube version was released in the United States by Natsume on March 28, 2006. For its European release by Rising Star Games, it was developed for the Wii console and eventually released on March 14, 2008. The Wii version adds motion-sensitive controls for actions such as fishing, mining and foraging but removes the option to play as a female character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Among a vast variety of possible personal goals to be accomplished in Magical Melody, there are two primary objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Firstly, players are enlisted by the Harvest Sprites to awaken the Harvest Goddess, who has turned herself to stone out of melancholy at the townspeople's disregard. To do this, players must gather musical notes by achieving various chores and milestones. Collecting at least fifty out of a total of one hundred notes allows the player to create the titular magical melody that will revive the village's protectress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secondly, the player is able to woo and eventually marry one of the townspeople. Players have the option of either a male or female character in the GameCube version. Each gender has a choice of ten potential spouses of the opposite sex, along with the androgynous rival Jamie who is eligible for either player gender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also includes several minigames in which up to four players can test their skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
