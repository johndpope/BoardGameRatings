							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Topfrosch</name>
									
			<description>Topfrosch consists of a wooden frame, four frogs (made from coconut halves), a sand timer, and 160 marbles in four colors. Marbles represent the insects that the frogs want to catch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set the frame on the table, place the marbles inside, then flip the sand timer. Each player grabs his frog and pushes it through the arena, trying to get as many marbles as possible under the frog before the 30-second timer runs out.&lt;br/&gt; Topfrosch includes various scoring versions: In the kids' version, each marble counts one point. For adults, each color counts only for one player/team, while other colors are deducted. In some versions, one color counts for everyone, etc. Whoever has the most points after a round wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
