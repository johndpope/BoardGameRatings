			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action and goal&lt;br/&gt;You have 3 decks of cards. Terrorists, counter-terrorists and action cards(which help ter. or c.-t. to win battle but you can do not use action card if feel your person card is strong enough).&lt;br/&gt;(1 vs 1) You can mix all cards and play so. Or you can play for any of 2 sides(terrorists or c.-t.).&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to have any card(terrorists or c-t)by the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fun&lt;br/&gt;This game have everything: the capture and release of the hostages, and defuzing bombs, monitoring, not a team playing, and even the invasion of zombies (coming zombies servers apparently). Game have ultimate funy combinations like - 3 meme royalflash kittys or Cheeter or Admin card. &lt;br/&gt;The game was originally planned on the card field, but in principle has been made for more user-friendly format of the game.&lt;br/&gt;Game developed with well-known CS players with experience of 10 years of playing. &lt;br/&gt;Skins special forces of many countries.&lt;br/&gt;Playing with humor.&lt;br/&gt;It is interesting to play a lot of micro rounds. When you become pro it will be interesting to play against 2 or three players.&lt;br/&gt;In plans to hold tournaments in the discipline of CS cards.&lt;br/&gt;So you can already start training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
