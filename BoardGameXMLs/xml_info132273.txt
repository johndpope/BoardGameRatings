							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The House That Jack Built</name>
									
			<description>Try to play all your cards in the same order as the lines of The House That Jack Built. Deal all the cards, one at a time. Some players may have more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever is at dealer's left begins by putting a House card (1) in the middle and saying line 1: &amp;ldquo;This is the House that Jack built.&amp;quot; Then, if he can, he puts a Malt card (2) on top and says line 2, continuing to play cards and say the lines in the right order as long as he can. When he does not have the next card, he gives one card to the player on his left, who continues from where the first player stopped. Whoever plays a Farmer (10) recites the whole poem, and then starts a new sequence with a House. If anyone cannot play in his turn, he may not pass a card. If anyone makes a mistake in the verse, everyone gives him a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first one to use his last card, either by playing or passing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
