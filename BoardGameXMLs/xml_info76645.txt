			<description>In Solar Winds, you are Jake Stone, a bounty hunter who, through several missions, uncovers a secret coalition between the government of your home solar system and a race of unidentified aliens. Upon further investigation, you find out that, in fact, there is more than one solar system involved&amp;hellip; And what is really happening is that three easily-provoked races are being held by a more technologically advanced race in a small cluster of solar systems, and kept there by a force field around them. Hyperdrive technology has been sabotaged, and the 'keys', jump points between solar systems, kept secret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was originally shareware.  Registration did not unlock any features of this game, but by registering you were given a copy of the sequel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Solar Winds,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
