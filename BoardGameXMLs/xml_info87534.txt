It entails protecting everyone from slashers; upholding federal criminal laws against repeat killers; providing leadership and law enforcement assistance to federal, state, local and international agencies in investigating paranormal attacks; and performing these responsibilities in a manner that is responsive to the needs of the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blood and Blades: The Profiler's Guide to Slashers. Blood and Blades includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     8 new victim classes: Cheerleader, Jock, Mundane, Nerd, Outcast, Scream Queen, Stoner, and Tough Guy.&lt;br/&gt;     1 new organization: The Paranormal Response Unit.&lt;br/&gt;     2 new advanced classes: the Bounty Hunter and the Profiler.&lt;br/&gt;     Lots of feats and character flaws for slasher and victim alike.&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for horror, madness, panic, and fear.&lt;br/&gt;     New rules on playing a GM-less horror movie-style game.&lt;br/&gt;     Places to go and people to kill: locations where victims are dying to get out, weapons to slice and dice with, and more.&lt;br/&gt;     New advanced classes for slashers: Alter Ego, Arawnite Guardian, Mad Genius, Psychogene, and Stalker.&lt;br/&gt;     Your favorite movie monsters, from the warrior breed to the demon pumpkin, the demonic slasher to the dream stalker, the thin stranger and his sentinel spheres to the soul sucker and the dreaded shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PRU: Putting the end to horror movie sequels everywhere. Do you have what it takes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
