			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play as one of the agile monsters that make up the Flock. Hunt down and attack the Carrier to take its place. Survive and fend off the terrifying Flock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 200 million deaths by players the game is said to be triggered to permanently shut down. Many have criticized the game for this, not wanting to buy something you will be unable to play in the future. Others argue that with the 30 to 60 minutes worth of content the game has it is unlikely to reach its 'unplayable' stage anytime soon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
