			<description>User Summary w/ Publisher Information&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Produced by BOA Publishing, this unofficial expansion of the Ambush! family of games requires only the base game to play. This stand-alone mission is the second installment of a planned 4 part series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Verletzer Tieger takes place in an area of the front lines where the Americans are pushing forward and then getting forced back causing the lines to blur. Many units on both sides have become separated from their parent units greatly confusing the situation.&amp;nbsp;Your squad is being sent forward to recon a small village and establish if the town's bridges are viable for tank and heavy vehicle traffic in preparation for another big Allied push.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the mission briefing your squad receives a welcome volunteer, a combat medic.&amp;nbsp;(Rules for the Medic are included in the mission.) The two major components of your medic will be his medical skill and his temperament. One determines how successful he we be at treating the wounded, the other determines how Gung Ho he is.&amp;nbsp;You may end up with a great healer who has a very low initiative that your squad has to baby sit or a so-so healer that knows how to dispense some powerful preventative medicine.&amp;nbsp;(There is an option in the rules to make the medic a permanent part of your squad for future missions.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mission includes four vehicle summary cards, one of which was created for this mission, the Marder II.&amp;nbsp;(It has its own vehicle summary and the mission ships with a counter displaying the Marder II.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mission also comes with the following:&lt;br/&gt;- 15 new soldier cards printed on hard cardstock&lt;br/&gt;- 10 pages of new paragraphs&lt;br/&gt;- 1 Mission Cartridge with 2 conditions&lt;br/&gt;- Mission Summary and special movement rules for the German Halftrack&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
