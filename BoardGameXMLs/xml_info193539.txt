			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First Kingdoms is an expansion for the Death of Legends dark-fantasy roleplaying game. Take the fight against the Enemy to the frozen, magic-infused, First Kingdoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nobody knows what fate befell the Ancients.  One day they were simply gone; only their magic remained.The City of Winterfall&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For centuries there was peace amongst the elder races.  But soon diplomacy and trade gave way to greed and conflict as Frost Elves warred with Stone Dwarves. Ice Dragons and Tree Folk attacked any who dared enter their territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long summer of the Ancients had given way to perpetual winter when the young races arrived in the First Kingdoms.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the freezing sea the Water-Sworn came in longships, raiding and plundering with fierce hunger.  From the East a new power rose as a hundred different tribes and peoples banded together for mutual protection and prosperity, forming a mighty Royal Coalition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These new arrivals were not welcomed by the elder races who still guarded their secrets jealously. War raged for years, a legacy of blood and suffering built on ever-changing alliances and treaties, as each faction sought dominance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, exhausted by war, an uneasy peace descended on the First Kingdoms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But now a dark power has risen.  It commands monstrous armies and seeks dominion over the First Kingdoms.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War is coming and nobody knows who can be trusted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion presents a new, highly magical, land where a shared history of war and conflict has fostered an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust between elder and younger races alike. Legendary heroes representing each race must decide who among them can be trusted in the battle for the survival against a powerful and malevolent Enemy who seeks dominion over the First Kingdoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First Kingdoms includes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Six new character archetypes including; Ice Dragon, Tree Folk, Frost Elf, Stone Dwarf, Water-Sworn (human) and Royal Coalition (human).&lt;br/&gt;    A map of the First Kingdoms with 18 territories specific to the characters and one non-aligned territory (Ruins of the Ancients).&lt;br/&gt;    Five new Final Act cards reflecting special actions or powers that manifest when a Legend dies (and a copy of the 'In League with the Enemy' card from the original game).&lt;br/&gt;    A brief guide to the First Kingdoms and notes to support facilitation of the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
