			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tsutomo Kouno's LocoRoco Cocoreccho!, released in Japan as Oideyo LocoRoco!! BuuBuu Cocoreccho! (おいでよロコロコ！！ BuuBuu Cocoreccho!) drops the player into an enormous two-dimensional environment, using a butterfly to corral various types of LocoRoco, and guide them to liberate their brethren.  There are various &amp;quot;gateways&amp;quot; in the environment that require certain numbers of LocoRoco in order to open or activate them, granting access to much more horizontal or vertical space than was previously evident to the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LocoRoco sing in amalgamated approximations of language, and each type sings differently, providing ample visual and audio stimulus to the player.  They also merrily go about their business without player interaction, but puzzles aren't likely to get solved without input from an outside intelligence, and that's where the player comes in.  The player can use the traditional buttons and sticks on the controller, as well as its motion sensing to control the environment and manipulate the LocoRoco.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
