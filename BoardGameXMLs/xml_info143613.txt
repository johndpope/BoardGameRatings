							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Montsegur 1244 - Boxed Edition</name>
									
			<description>user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the Italian Edition of Montsegur 1244, combining the core game and the expansion (extra characters and scene cards) with additional chapters by Ezio Melega, Claudia Cangini and Luca Veluttini. The Italian box was published in 2011. It contains rules for playing the game in addition to 3 sets of cards (events, suggestions, characters) and a fabric board that sets the pace of the scenes for playing the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2014, an English equivalent of the Italian edition was published. In the same year, a German translation in the same design was published. It includes the additional chapters by the Italian authors but only has the 12 &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; characters, not the expansion cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you renounce your heretic beliefs and do you wish to receive the forgiveness of the merciful Father?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In March 1244 this question was posed to several hundred Cathars. They had surrendered to the army that had besieged the castle of Montsegur for more than nine months. More than two hundred answered no, and thereby chose death by fire. Who were these people that chose to die for their belief?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Montsegur 1244 the players collaborate to create a story about who these people were. Each player takes on the role of one of the besieged Cathars who will face the choice between life and faith.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Montsegur 1244 is a story game about burning for your belief for 3-6 players, duration 3-6 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
