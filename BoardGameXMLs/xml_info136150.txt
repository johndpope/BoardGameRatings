			<description>Conundrum is the exciting game where everyone plays by their own rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has the same set of eight rules. The challenge is knowing when to play each rule, because the rules can only be played once. Played in eight rounds, every player is dealt 10 cards each round. Each player selects the rule that he/she will play by for that round, based on his/her hand. So each player will be playing the round by a different set of rules. After each round, those rules will clear and a new hand is dealt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to try to play as many cards as possible each round. Every card left in a player's hand after each round is a point. The winner is the player with the fewest points after eight rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
