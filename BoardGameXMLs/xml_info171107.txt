			<description>Castle Men 4X is a 4X micro-game set in a fantasy world.  Players are vying to create the most successful civilization on a small map made from just 9 cards. As each card contains multiple territories of different terrain types, the map varies from game to game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must explore the terrain on the map, expand their settlements by exploiting local resources and of course try and exterminate their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To help their civilization grow they can gain knowledge which is traded in for developments that impact upon game play.  18 different developments are available to help, on just 9 cards. Each development a player chooses deprives them and their opponent of another alternative one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player actions are selected on a roundel, with a range of actions available each turn, although repeat actions are not possible.  Each completed journey round the roundel completes a season of the year and the different seasons confer benefits and responsibilities upon players that affect the progress of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players win by being the first to accrue a specified number of  victory points.  Victory points are achieved through gaining developments and building developing settlements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All components for play can fit in a 2oz tobacco tin making it highly portable, and files include labels for the lid of such a container.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
