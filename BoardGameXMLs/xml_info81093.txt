			<description>Manhunt 2 is a psychological survival horror game released by Rockstar Games in 2007. It has an infamous reputation in the gaming world, mainly due to its extremely violent content in which the player can 'execute' enemies by killing them in a variety of brutal and gory ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Manhunt 2 you control the escaped mental patient Daniel Lamb and his fellow inmate Leo Kasper as you try to uncover your forgotten past. In a similar vain to the original Manhunt, the player must use stealth to either avoid or sneak up on and kill enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manhunt 2 features several updated aspects, including the ability to trigger 'environmental executions' by using nearby scenery to dispatch foes and 'jump executions' where you dispatch enemies by jumping down on them from a higher elevation. It also features improved stealth mechanics, including the ability to both make and hide in shadows, the ability to jump, climb and crawl, hug walls, and enemies that have stronger AI who can be attracted by noise such as treading on broken glass and knocking over objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manhunt 2 caused strong controversy both before and after it release. Its predecessor game Manhunt was linked to the murder of a 14 year old boy in 2004, and although the murder would eventually be ruled as drug related allegations that the game was somehow responsible continued. Manhunt 2 didn't initially make it onto the market. The BBFC &amp;amp; IFCO refused to rate it at all whilst it received an almost unheard of 'AO' (Adults Only) rating by the ESRB, meaning none of Nintendo, Sony &amp;amp; Microsoft would be willing to allow it on their consoles. Rockstar heavily edited the game in a hope to make it acceptable enough for a rating. They added a blurring effect over the executions and altered or changed several aspects of them. They also removed innocent characters which existed in the game environments but could still be killed, and took away the scoring system which rewarded players based on the gruesomeness of executions. This edited version of the game was re-submitted and accepted by both the IFCO &amp;amp; ESRB with an M (Mature) Rating. The BBFC once again refused to rate it, and when Rockstar appealed the game was reviewed two more times before finally passing the BBFC (4 votes to 3) with an 18 Certificate, and the game was released on PS2, PSP &amp;amp; Wii late in 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite these problems the game has since been released twice in its un-edited form, once on PC in 2009 (with an AO rating) and once in 2011 on Gamersgate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
