			<description>In this game, each player is an inhabitant of one of the continents. At the start of the game, each player will receive an assignment, which will involve visiting some location on another continent. When a player reaches his destination, he gets another assignment. The first player to complete all four assignments related to his continent wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players travel across the board by throwing one or two dice and moving the exact amount shown. Players cannot pass each other, except on the airport spaces. If a player lands exactly on top of another player, that other player is returned to his home town. In addition, on some squares a player must draw a Route Card or an Action Card that will trigger some special effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The assignments represent certain questions that the player is supposed to find an answer to, such as Does apartheid exist in Latin-America? When a player completes his assignment, he receives a card which contains the answer to that question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the advanced version of the game, General Problems are added, which concern problems that aren&amp;rsquo;t linked to one of the continents. Each player receives two cards describing such a problem. Cards describing the solutions are distributed among the players. In addition to completing their assignments, the players also need to find the solution to their General Problems. Certain locations on the game board offer the option to ask another player for the solution card, as do certain Action Cards. (One of these locations is New York, as headquarters of the United Nations.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expert version of the game adds the United Nations Securtiy Council to the game. Players visiting New York can now call for a meeting of the Security Council. During such a meeting, the players vote on the positioning of UN Armies. These armies block player movement. No player can pass them (but by landing on top of them, they can be removed).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
