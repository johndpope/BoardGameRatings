							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dying Memoryes: Vertigo</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Dying Memoryes: Vertigo, the characters are crewmembers in cryogenic sleep aboard a ship &amp;mdash; the Anvil &amp;mdash; in deep space, en route to the Earth-like planet of Hephaestus. But the ship drifts off course and is captured in the gravity well of an uncharted world. As its orbit decays, the vessel begins to break apart, and emergency protocols attempt to wake the crew from their torpor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the ship drifts off course. A cascade of failures causes more systems to malfunction &amp;mdash; precious oxygen bleeds from the ship, power supplies flicker.  Slowly dying from cerebral hypoxia, the crew&amp;rsquo;s brains struggle to wake them before their impending doom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reliving important moments from their past through disjointed and dying memories, the characters must determine whose lives they are living. But memories cannot always be trusted, and fact and fiction blend together while their unconscious minds fill in the blanks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, the Anvil continues its descent towards disaster. Can the crew work through their evanescent recollections and awaken in time to save the ship?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: This mini version of the Praxis game requires players to own at least one other Praxis game or know the rules to Praxis. This PDF only includes an introduction, characters, and story milestones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: This game is based on another design of mine named Dying Memoryes from the GMZero game line. They do not play similarly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
