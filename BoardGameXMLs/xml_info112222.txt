			<description>All 26 Major League Baseball teams and their players from the 1991 Major League Baseball season are present in this game. This includes players like Cal Ripken, Dave Winfield, and Kirby Puckett. Players get to play in either a dome, modern, or traditional stadium each with their own unique characteristics. The game uses the modified version of the Joystix font that was popular in 1980s video games. Players are shown standing up for the national anthem of both the United States and Canada (for games played in Toronto with the mighty and awe-inspiring Blue Jays). They can also choose to substitute a hitter or a runner while at bat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All game stats are shown on the fictitious newspaper, known as the Namco Sports paper. Players are permitted to zoom in and out of the paper to look for minor details. The words &amp;quot;game over&amp;quot; appear on the screen regardless of whether the player wins or loses a game. Passwords can be entered to restore progress in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both one-player and two-player modes integrates the traditional playing mode of the game. If the player wins the single-player tournament, then he can see the ending. The battle mode becomes a single-game mode when two players are playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super Batter Up&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
