			<description>A Scrabble-like word game designed and published by an advertising agency for using as a gift to their customers. You are using nine letters, there are no tripling options, doubling options are scarce and there are some extra bonuses available. The rules are constantly making fun of the advertisement world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
