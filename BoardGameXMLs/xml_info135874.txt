			<description>Shoot straight. Conserve ammo. And never, EVER cut a deal with a dragon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jordan Weisman, the creator of Shadowrun, is back&amp;ndash; and he&amp;rsquo;s bringing Shadowrun with him. He and our team at Harebrained Schemes are heads-down on Shadowrun Returns: a rich 2D turn-based single player game with deep story interaction, meaningful character development, and highly-detailed tactical combat. The game&amp;rsquo;s not only going to make some old geeks (like us) very happy, but it will introduce new players to a dynamic gaming universe already beloved around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadowrun Returns&lt;br/&gt;Developed by hit studio Harebrained Schemes for release in Summer 2013, Shadowrun Returns is the brainchild of Jordan Weisman, founder of FASA Corporation and the original creator of Shadowrun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in 2054 Seattle, Shadowrun Returns immerses the player in a noir story of betrayal and revenge with control of a dynastic megacorp hanging in the balance. The turn-based computer role-playing game is beautifully presented from an isometric point of view that allows players great tactical control of the character they create and the shadowrunners they hire. The game will be published for PC, Mac, iOS tablets, and Android tablets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catalyst had the pleasure of fact checking Jordan&amp;rsquo;s story (throwing in an idea or two in the process) and is working with Harebrained Schemes on other opportunities to deepen the Shadowrun fan&amp;rsquo;s experience, such as the launch of Shadowrun.com.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;While I could never have anticipated it 24 years ago when I created the Shadowrun universe, it is oddly appropriate that &amp;ldquo;The Year of Shadowrun&amp;rdquo; begins on 12/21/2012. It&amp;rsquo;s been almost 20 years since I worked in this world and I am very excited to be immersed in it again, bringing an authentic Shadowrun RPG to digital gaming&amp;rdquo;, said Jordan Weisman, CEO and Creative Director of Harebrained Schemes. &amp;ldquo;A key element for us was to make sure that the digital RPG provides the same kind of storytelling opportunities as the tabletop version, and thus we are releasing the game&amp;rsquo;s editor so everyone can create their own stories within the Shadowrun universe. I am so grateful to the fans of Shadowrun that have kept the game alive for almost a quarter-century and gave Harebrained Schemes this unique opportunity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
