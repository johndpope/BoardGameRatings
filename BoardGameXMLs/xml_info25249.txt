			<description>&lt;br/&gt;    A Japanese Traditional Trick/Picture-cards Taking Game by ad hoc-team &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is Japan. The winter of the north country Tsugaru is in the deep snow. But even so there, flowers of the trick-taking game had quietly and gallantly flourished!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kan is the short form of the Kankei(relationship). At first, Kankei team and Non-Kankei teams are determined by dealt cards and the fight  against each other for the 16 picture cards(Each A, K, Q and J). Friends in earlier rounds could be opponents for the next deal!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A deal consists of ten tricks. Trumps are determined each deal. For each individual case, each player should try to guess what in other  players hands and then try to help each other according to game-rules using the cards in one's hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If Kankei team wins, they will play same team up to 3 deals. At 2nd and/or 3rd deal of same Kankei team, they can decide trump suit from definite information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At Go-nin-Kan (or 5 hands Kan), Kankei team consist of two players against Non-Kankei team with three. If a player plays as a dealer, the game becomes easier and smooth. (At official tournament, always six players play.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play less than five players with Variant rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For four hands, Damari-Kan (quiet Kan, two against two).&lt;br/&gt;For three hands, Ganbari-Kan (bearing Kan, one against two).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Japon Brand version&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The special deck of the Go-nin-Kan from JAPON BRAND featured Japanese four seasons as suits (Spring: Night cherry blossom. Summer: Beech leaf. Autumn: Apple fruit. Winter: Snow crystal). As picture cards, the Japanese summer celebrations Neputa(sleeping-purging) and Mushi-Okuri(worm-purging) are illustrated. In addition, this set includes marker cards for displaying examples of playing situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We wish for you to experience Japanese and/or Tsugaru soul!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
