			<description>From the RPG:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is about spies. Not real spies, but extraordinarily unconventional spies. The men and women who seem to dodge every bullet, shrug off every wound, and break every rule in the book. Not just the rules of espionage, either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spies we're are about to play are professionals, but not necessarily good at being normal people. Your spies are lunatics, idiots, and grown-up children. Turns out a big part of growing up is working a nine-to-five job. Your characters are too busy wrecking expensive resorts and capitols to build character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is about getting drunk on the genre. The tropes and jokes commonplace in shows like Archer and movies like Red or Mr. and Mrs. Smith. The aim is to create another spy film and have fun doing it. Not normal fun, but dizzying throw-up-in-the-bushes fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
