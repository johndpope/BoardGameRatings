			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Thralls are Coming...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, a villain needs a little help.  Whether it's with Magic, Martial Arts, Mechanica, Powers, or Psionics, they can now summon up that help with a little time and a little Risk.  It doesn't matter whether they're zombies, robots, minions, demons, or creations of pure will and imagination; they're called Thralls, and they're coming to make life difficult for the heroes of every era!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes two new character packages (Thralls and Demons), new Magic Spells, Martial Arts  Techniques, Mechanica Systems, Powers, and Psionic Disciplines for creating, summoning, and manipulating Thralls of all kinds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are thirty Thralls, including undead, minions, robots, demons, spirits, and the creations of will and imagination collectively known as Thralls themselves!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And who knows?  Maybe Thralls aren't just for bad guys any more.  Explore the economics of Thrall creation for fun and profit, try a little Necromancy or Diabolism on for size, and decide where you stand on the issue of free will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thralls can think and feel, but they're considered property at best.  To most right-minded people, that's considered slavery; will you stand back and watch society run on the backs of enslaved intellects, or take a stand for the freedom of every sentience, no matter how inhuman?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Better make a decision soon... the Thralls are coming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
