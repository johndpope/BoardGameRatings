			<description>From publisher description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Imagine a house surrounded by a dark, thick forest. The house is cozy, familiar, and is filled with all the creature comforts of home. This is your space. It&amp;rsquo;s been there all of your life. The house is older than you, but not so old as to be dusty or antique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The thick forest outside of the house is older. Much, much older than the house. The forest existed long before the house was ever built, you think. The house is tall, but the trees of the forest are so much taller. [&amp;hellip;] The forest holds the promise of newness and discovery, but it is also strange and alien and other.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Into the Feywild flings the player characters into another realm and places them at the mercy of a petulant, childish Archfey. They must find a way home by making peace with this Archfey, exploring the labyrinthine Hedgegrove, and encountering unlikely friends within the Feywild. The adventure is very open-ended, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold the GM&amp;rsquo;s hand, instead offering open maps, random tables, and potential encounters without prescribing a set course for the players. Railroading? Not in this adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Into the Feywild is weird and fantastical&amp;mdash;something more akin to Burroughs or Howard than Tolkien. If your players are looking for epic heroics, this adventure might not be for them&amp;hellip; but if they&amp;rsquo;re up for bizarre, Morrowind-esque oddities, they&amp;rsquo;ve come to the right place. The adventure was written by Kiel Chenier, who you can find giving great D&amp;amp;D advice and making a game called Snow Witch, Shield Maiden at dungeonsdonuts.tumblr.com. Be sure to follow him if you like Into the Feywild!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
