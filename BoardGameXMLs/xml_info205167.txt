			<description>This is an undated space travel game from Belgium that combines roll-and-move with resource management. The board covers the solar system, and the goal is to accumulate the most money primarily by being the first to land on planets. Landing bonuses range from 100 million for the moon to 1,000 million for Pluto, and there are game end bonuses for last planet, each planet card and most planet cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The standard red interplanetary track includes hazards that can bump players onto a useless green track. The red track leads to yellow orbital tracks around each planet, which in turn link to white landing tracks. Players must try to hit cross-over and landing points precisely, and can be damaged or even killed if they land too fast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, players declare their acceleration and pay the appropriate amount of fuel, from 1 tonne for 1D6 to 32 tonnes for 6D6. Players may instead spend 5 tonnes for a retro thrust (1D6-3) or 20 tonnes for a super-retro (1D6 in reverse). Players may also spend money for help from an &amp;quot;electronic brain&amp;quot; that allows movement of exactly 1 in either direction for 50 million up to 4 for 400 million.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can buy fuel cheaply while on a planet or at double price at any time. It also can be had for free by landing on a space station (25t) and by giving up a turn while on a planet or station (10t). Players can borrow money from the bank if necessary to buy fuel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are in Flemish and French, and while the game is undated, the box graphic looks a lot like the space ship from the Tintin graphic novels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
