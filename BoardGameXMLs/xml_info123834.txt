			<description>Hot Slots, or AV Pachisuro (AVパチスロ?), is a slot machine simulation video game developed by Hacker International for the Family Computer and Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), and published by Panesian Taiwan in 1991.&lt;br/&gt;AV Pachisuro is the title of the Japanese release for the Nintendo Family Computer; Hot Slots (titled Hot Slot in-game) is the English-language version of the game published for the NES. The title AV Pachisuro combines the English initialism AV (audio-visual) with the Japanese contracted word pachisuro (a portmanteau of pachinko and slot).&lt;br/&gt;To begin a game, the player chooses one of three slot machines: Cutie Bunny, Juicy Fruits, or Las Vegas. Each machine has a distinct visual design and musical score. After purchasing &amp;quot;medallions&amp;quot; (token coins), the player may play up to five medallions in a machine for each pull. The player stops each reel by pressing a direction on the D-pad. Between spins, the player can optionally switch to another machine.&lt;br/&gt;Hot Slots is an eroge, a video game that rewards game progress, persistence, or performance with images that are sexually explicit or suggestive. Each slot machine is accompanied by a scantily-clad hostess, who appears at intervals when the player's winnings surpass a certain threshold. When the player nets a profit of $210, the game displays a full-screen cartoon image of the partially clothed hostess with a caption or speech balloon. At a net profit of $300, she loses more of her clothing; at $450, she appears nude.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Hot Slots&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
