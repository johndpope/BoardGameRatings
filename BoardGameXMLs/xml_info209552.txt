			<description>A tower defense board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Urfin Jus is a children's brain-training game. You take command of the defenses of the Emerald City, which is being attacked on all sides by wooden soldiers. Your goal is to build special defensive towers that fire at various parts of the map according to certain rules. Each turn all the players reach into a bag full of tower parts, find the pieces of the structures they need by feel, and decide where to put the towers they construct. The wooden soldiers then take several steps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Urfin Jus is an way to teach logical reasoning, develop motor skills (you try finding the right part in the bag!), and is just plain fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
