			<description>From the introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since before you can remember, it&amp;rsquo;s been like this. You&amp;rsquo;re a Lowlifer, living in the dregs of Utopia. They are the Highlifers, living in their buildings that graze the clouds. The distinction has been clear since way back when; They Are Important, You Are Not. They enact and enforce the laws, they make all the money, they decide who excels and who suffers. ...&lt;br/&gt;Eventually, however, Lowlifers come to the end of their ropes, and they only have one choice: enter the Dungeon. Slay the creatures within, collect their wealth, strip the bones of those who came before, and emerge, battered but not beaten, to live and eat another day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
