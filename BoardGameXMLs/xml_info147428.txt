							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wormhole Warfare Escape from New Ork City</name>
									
			<description>'Escape from New Ork City' is a miniature party wargame mixed with deck-building, dice-rolling, parody, and satire that is also ready to play and easy to learn. The objective of the game is to rescue fallen heroes before other players can claim the glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players build their card deck and miniature model army by starting with 4 currency cards called 'Wormhole Charge Level 1'.  These can be used in exchange to teleport economy upgrade cards (for example: Wormhole Charge Level 2's), miniature army unit models paired with their unit cards, and unit upgrade cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most models by default move 1 hexagon tile per turn.  Combat is determined by rolling 2D6 and adding the modifiers on the models' cards and their upgrade cards if they apply.  The defending player must also roll 2D6 and also adds applicable card modifiers.  The winner of the combat is the player with the highest total sum and any card special abilities are then put into play.  In addition the winning player earns an additional currency card (Wormhole Charge Level 2) and the losing player picks up a negative currency card (Wormhole Charge Level 0), and places it in the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
