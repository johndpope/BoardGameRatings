							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rebelstar: Tactical Command</name>
									
			<description>Rebelstar: Tactical Command is a Game Boy Advance turn-based tactical video game developed by Codo Technologies in 2005. The game was created by Julian Gollop, who designed the X-COM games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the X-COM games, there is no base building, resource management or research. During combat, the player controls a squad of characters and must accomplish various goals. Characters have a certain amount of action points, which are renewed at the beginning of every turn. Each action, from turning to walking to shooting consumes action points. Therefore they are only allowed to perform a certain amount of actions per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Rebelstar: Tactical Command,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
