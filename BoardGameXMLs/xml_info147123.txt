			<description>2 to 4 Players relive the golden age of American arcades by starting their own. Each round vintage arcade equipment cards like pinball machines, foosball, ping pong, pool tables and video game machines are auctioned off. Players must manage which machines make them money and how much space the equipment takes up in their rented back rooms. &amp;quot;High score&amp;quot; cards are earned each round by players who best use the space available to them or earn the most tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round players must: adjust which equipment cards they will use and what goes into storage... Repair equipment that is out of order,.. And choose whether to advertise. Tokens are earned each pay day by the roll of dice.  Some equipment will earn more tokens and some offer a greater probability of earning. Players also decide each round to purchase newly available equipment, or steal opponents equipment that they have in storage. The game ends when a player collects 11 or more high score cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
