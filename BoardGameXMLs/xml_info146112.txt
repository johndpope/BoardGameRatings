							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Card Pirates</name>
									
			<description>Card Pirates is a &amp;quot;pirates&amp;quot; card game for 2 - 4 players. Players take the role of an old fashioned pirate ship on the high seas, searching for treasure, avoiding storms, attacking other ships and attempting to win the favour of the island governors. The game is playable with just one pack of playing cards and a token to represent each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing cards are spread out face down in a grid representing the high seas, with a few kept in the players' hands. The Aces are reserved and placed last to represent islands with buried treasure. Players take turns to use the number cards in their hands to sail across the sea, discover new cards and attack other ships, and use their face cards to reclaim treasure and other higher ranking face cards from islands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends the moment all the treasure has been recovered from the islands. The winner is the player who has the best combination of Aces and face cards in their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
