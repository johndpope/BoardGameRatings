			<description>In Dirt Racer, players must drive their vehicle across a road rally. The car comes complete with a speedometer (in kilometres), a lap counter, and a lap time counter. There are a pre-determined number of chances to complete the game, like in Super Mario Kart and F-Zero. If the player is unable to defeat the game in those number of tries, then the player gets an automatic game over. A yellow smiley face shows up to track the performance of the driver. If it's smiling, then the player is winning. Otherwise, the player is losing the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dirt Racer uses the Super FX chip to provide enhanced graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dirt Racer&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
