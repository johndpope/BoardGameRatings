			<description>A fantasy expansion for chess, adding dice, cards, tokens, and treasure chests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players receive Mana tokens that may be traded to activate special abilities, cast spells, or upgrade units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treasure chests, scattered across the field, contain weapons, armor, potions, and accessories to boost individual pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each piece is assigned a die value (D4, D6, D8, etc.) for combat, as well as three special abilities.  Pawns dig up treasure.  Bishops cast healing and other protective spells.  Queens send lightning bolts across the playing field.  Kings inspire nearby units, and so forth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning conditions are similar to traditional Chess, except that the king must be defeated in combat.  Check and Check Mate simply offer bonuses to defeating the King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Epic Chess preserves the sound strategic elements of traditional Chess, while adding many new elements for Chess players of any level to enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
