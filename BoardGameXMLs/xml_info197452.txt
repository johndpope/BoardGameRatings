			<description>A crash landing on a world inhabited by bee-like lifeforms. Stranded, our hero must unravel the rules of this uncharted planet to find their way home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Puzzle Platforming inspired by many of the great classics of the past. Carefully designed levels intended to provide an enjoyable difficulty curve. Meticulously-crafted pixel art creates a throwback to classic 16-bit aesthetics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on a Flash game released in 2012, Recursion Deluxe has been rebuilt from the ground up in a new engine. This deluxe version features new puzzle mechanics, additional biomes, remastered original content, twice as many levels, new music and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
