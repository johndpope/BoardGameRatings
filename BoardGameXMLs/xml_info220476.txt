			<description>This game includes 4 dice-games with a game board to document the winning points with wooden counters (blue=100, black=10, red=1). If a counter gets on a red or white number the player gets a penality (retreat a number of spaces or pay game token).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Die 999&lt;br/&gt;The first player to roll 999 or higher wins the game. Each player rolls 3 dice. The lowest number is multipled by 100, the next highest number by 10. If a sequence is rolled (1-2-3, 2-3-4, 3-4-5, 4-5-6)the player pays 2 token into the playing till. By the roll of a triplet he has to pay 2 token the player to his right. If he rolls &amp;quot;Kanone&amp;quot; (2-1-x, 3-1-x, 4-2-x)he has to pay 2 token to the player to his left. In all 3 cases, the numbers don't count for winning points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Die lustige Sieben (The funny seven)&lt;br/&gt;The Players rol 3 dice. The first to reach 999 wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;Rolls that include &amp;quot;7&amp;quot; (all 3 or 2 dice) or &amp;quot;14&amp;quot; (all 3 dice) get special points. There is a rise- and a descent-phase. During the rise the player who rolls the lowest number gets the Points of the player who rolls the highest number and vice versa. During the descent it's the opposite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Hunderteins gewinnt (101 wins)&lt;br/&gt;This game is played with 1 die. The player to exactly reach 101 wins the game. If a player rolls over 101, the surplus points are substracted. Each turn the player may roll as often as he choses. But if he risks to much and rolls a 1, he only gets  1 point for the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Max &amp;amp; Moritz&lt;br/&gt;This is a combination of game 1 and 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
