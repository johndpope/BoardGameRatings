			<description>Bubsy 3D is the first and only Bubsy game in 3D and was released in 1997 for the PlayStation video game console. It is a sequel to the original in terms of the story and takes place on the Woolies' home planet, Rayon. Bubsy 3D has 16 main levels and two boss levels and the main character's goal is to defeat the two queens of Rayon, Poly and Esther. The player can collect rockets, as well as atoms, in order to eventually escape from planet Rayon. The graphics are very simplistic, even for their time, with a dense fog  that covers entire levels throughout the game. Bubsy actively speaks throughout the game based on various actions performed by the player. Accolade planned to release the game for the Sega Saturn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bubsy 3D: Furbitten Planet,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
