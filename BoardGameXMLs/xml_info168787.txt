							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pithecus</name>
									
			<description>Pithecus is a simple close tactical combat game. The players control groups of early primates: Ramapithecus on one side and Australopithecus on the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primates are rated for strength, movement, and morale. Each may take one of four actions (attack, stay, flee, or fight) each turn, but must make a morale check first. There are some simple terrain rules. Wounds and death are recorded by rotating the &amp;quot;counters,&amp;quot; which are actually folded paper cubes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two maps are provided, each in two sections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was one of Kaylor and Humrichouser's Games With Depth, which all used folded 3D paper pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Ramapithecus is today not regarded as its own genus, and in any case lived millions of years before any of the Australopithecus species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
