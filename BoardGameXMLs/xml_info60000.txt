							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Complete Guide to T-Rex</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No real-life creature has stoked the flames of imagination more than tyrannosaurus rex. Since its discovery a century ago, T-rex has served as a constant reminder of human frailty. Not only does its massive mouth belittle mankind (its jaws are, after all, as long as a man is tall), but its Earthly reign makes us pitifully insignificant. Homo sapiens has walked the Earth for a mere 100,000 years -- but tyrannosaurus rex ruled for six million years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragons were real, and they were called T-rex. The Complete Guide to T-rex gives you the rules and background you need to put these real-life dragons in your d20 game. By the time you're done reading, T-rex won't be a dumb lizard; it will be an intelligent conqueror that forms alliances, remembers treachery, and builds dynasties that span generations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have taken a few fantastic liberties with T-rex. The standard T-rex is present, of course, in both the forms that history has known it: the sluggish, tail-dragging version painted by Charles Knight, and the modern, fleet-footed version depicted in Jurassic Park. But we go even further than that. (This is a fantasy game, after all.) Modern reptiles continue growing their entire lives. What if T-rex was the same? What if this king of predators (whose only natural enemies were his T-rex rivals) survived to extreme ages? How large could he get? And what are the implications of the sheer willpower that must reside in such a beast?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Complete Guide to T-rex is a stand-alone, world-neutral supplement. It can be used with a Broncosaurus Rex campaign, or ported to any other d20 world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
