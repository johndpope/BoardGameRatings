			<description>Ben Hvr simulates a full 7-lap classic Roman race and it is playable in 60-90 minutes.  Whip your opponents, swerve into them, and call down the wrath of the fates!  Watch your endurance or you may end up wrecked and running for your life - but even then you are not out of the race.  Try to jump on a passing chariot and throw your opponent off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is desk-top published, with most pieces being made of paper that must be cut from sheets.  (B&amp;amp;W with colour borders.)  In each of the 6 game colours there are 12 chips, 1 small die, a lap marker, 12 action cards, a paper chariot and a paper driver.  There are 12 fate cards and a three-piece map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
