			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;F1-Race is racing game released for the Gameboy in 1990. The game is developed and released by Nintendo. In the game the player takes control of a formula 1 car and has to compete in a championship around the world. The player can choose between two types of cars. In the game the player can use a nitro to increase the speed. The game also implements slipstream, in such a way that when a player drives behind another car for some seconds, the max speed of the players car will increase for a few moments. This often enables the player to overtake that other car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game supports up to four players using a four player adapter which was included with some releases of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
