							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Isla Tetra 2</name>
									
			<description>Self-published, hand crafted, and now available from: Solway Games: sargent254@btinternet.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following in the sandy footprints of Isla Tetra comes its card-driven 2-player cousin, Isla Tetra 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been three days since that terrible event: The violent turbulence; the acrid smell of smoke; the sudden descent and then the panicked screams of other passengers. You&amp;rsquo;re in shock, hungry and disoriented. The shore is littered with debris from the crash, but what to do first? Food? Fire? Explore the island? Help!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expert survivors will accrue more points during their time on Isla Tetra through cunning inventory expansion, clever health management, and successful completion of a set number of survival tasks. The game is played solo, or as a survival competition against the clock between 2 players - yes, it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long for an argument to break out over scarce supplies and resources, and now it&amp;rsquo;s a race to simply stay alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You might think you can get by, simply walking the sun-kissed sands hunting for red snapper, allowing the hypnotic effect of the crashing waves to ease your injuries, but as you soak up the sun events back home are taking a turn for the worse: As the months tick by, the search for your downed plane is eventually called off, your job is readvertised, and your car has been sold to keep up with the bills. After two years of waiting, your family holds a memorial service and your partner is now returning to a social life as a single person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must strike a balance between plundering the island&amp;rsquo;s resources for points while ensuring they&amp;rsquo;re not last off the island to face the worst news once home (and the most penalty points). Each day you&amp;rsquo;ll beachcomb the golden sands to see what has been gifted to you from the azure, salty brine. Use this flotsam and jetsam, such as rusty cans and broken umbrellas, represented by chunky, 3D DriftCube shapes, to build a shelter, craft essential tools and a fishing spear; then explore deep into the island's heart. Link the same DriftCubes together on your playmat to &amp;lsquo;build&amp;rsquo; action grids, such as exploring, fishing, and foraging for food. In these instances DriftCube shapes represent time as opposed to raw materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a race for survival. It&amp;rsquo;s a race to get home...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It's Ubongo meets Lost&amp;quot; - review comment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
