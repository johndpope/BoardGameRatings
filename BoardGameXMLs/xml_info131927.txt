			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I was a kid, I was infatuated with ghost stories. I read everything and anything I could find about ghosts. I didn&amp;rsquo;t discriminate between fiction and dubious nonfiction and folklore. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember all, or even most, of the stories now. Mostly I&amp;rsquo;ve retained fragments without context. I remember a Victorian child who fell down a flight of stairs, leaving a blood stain at the bottom that would return, undeterred after every cleaning day. I remember the witch&amp;rsquo;s jawbone, and how her spirit would leave fruit and toys for poor sick Mrs. Bell, even while it consumed her husband&amp;rsquo;s life. I remember the hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s abandoned jacket, and her tombstone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I only remember those fragments now, because I grew old enough to stop thinking about ghost stories and to start thinking about work and codependent relationship and role-playing games about post-Reconstruction racism. I also grew old enough to realize I had lost something, or many things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shade is a ghost story game. It&amp;rsquo;s also a game about how life diminishes us, and how death (or our ideas about it) empowers us. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple narrative role-playing game that can be played in a single sitting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shade uses a custom deck of personality cards to guide each character&amp;rsquo;s journey through life, and their transformation after death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
