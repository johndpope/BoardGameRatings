							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Relics of the Akashics</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over a thousand years ago, there was a great empire among the stars. Both bright and terrible, the Akashic Empire spread its tendrils through hundreds of worlds, crushing native resistance and using their psychic powers to enslave entire races. Led by a humanish race called the Vren, the Akashics believed in the existence of the Akashic Overmind, a force connecting all sentient species capable of thought. Unfortunately, this did not lead to a sense of community with their fellow species but instead it led to a righteous belief in the superiority of innately psionic races, themselves in particular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Destroyed after a long and ferocious war, the Vren's creations still linger on many worlds or in the void of space. This book unlocks their secrets. Within its pages you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    8 New Deadly Weapons&lt;br/&gt;    4 New Potent Armors&lt;br/&gt;    10 Celestial Treasures, generic items (one of which has 11 sub-varieties)&lt;br/&gt;    1 New Creature&lt;br/&gt;    3 New Ships&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included is an appendix on how to use the book without psionics or in fantasy games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
