							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Darklands</name>
									
			<description>Darklands is a world in which you command the armies of man and beast that your ancestors once did for glory, power or simple survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What if dragons really flew and giants really walked the earth? What if berserkers actually were bear-men, man and bear joined together? What if all of the myths and legends we take for granted were real and our ancestors fought against - and with - creatures and beings and realms we thought were nothing more than the fantasies of our uncivilised selves?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based in the Dark Ages in the year 650AD in Northwest Europe, Darklands is a Skirmish Wargame that allows you to field the men and mythological beasts of the time. This game will allow you to:&lt;br/&gt;- Take command of Norse Trolls and J&amp;ouml;tunn and conduct raids on the coast of Dark Age Britain.&lt;br/&gt;- Lead the hosts of Baalor, the Evil Eye in the Ice, and the Fomoraic, a race of half men and beast along with hideous sea creatures under the thrall of Baalor in their quest to crush Dark Age Ireland.&lt;br/&gt;- Defend Dark Age Wales with the Brythoniaid and their draconic allies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will feature the following Kindreds (factions):&lt;br/&gt;- Albainn (Picts) &lt;br/&gt;- Angelcynn (Angles)&lt;br/&gt;- Atalantes (Classic Greeks from the mythical continent of Atlantis)&lt;br/&gt;- Brythoniaid (Welsh Britons)&lt;br/&gt;- Byzantii (Dark Age Romans)&lt;br/&gt;- &amp;Eacute;rainn (Irish)&lt;br/&gt;- Fomoraic (Fomorians)&lt;br/&gt;- Khthones (Escaped slaves of the Atlantes and all are Reptilian Anthropomorphs such as Snakes, Crocodiles, Hydras and Basilisks)&lt;br/&gt;- Norse (Vikings)&lt;br/&gt;- Ysians (An alliance of Kernow and the mythical city of Ys)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With these additional, smaller Kindreds appearing as allies to the others:&lt;br/&gt;- The Vras (Greedy ratmen allied with the Ysians)&lt;br/&gt;- Infernii (Daemons from Dantes Divine Comedy allied with the Byzantii)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some features of the gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;- Individual alternate unit activation&lt;br/&gt;- D10s based&lt;br/&gt;- Inches are the primary measurement&lt;br/&gt;- Game turns are called 'Hours'&lt;br/&gt;- Will feature weather and time of day&lt;br/&gt;- A big mechanic of the game is that all warriors large and small, when they are wounded, become weaker for the rest of the game.&lt;br/&gt;- Bows will be able to shoot arrows the length of the table and beyond - but their shots loose power with increased range.&lt;br/&gt;- Army Standards and Army Musicians important to game play and orders&lt;br/&gt;- Plastic round bases with arcs of visibility pre-marked&lt;br/&gt;- Dark Magic will be involved. Using it will come &amp;ldquo;at a price&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
