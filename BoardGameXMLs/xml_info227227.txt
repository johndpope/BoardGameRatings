							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Redemption City</name>
									
			<description>After the apocalypse, the Earth is all but destroyed, save for the last city. The few remaining humans who were neither good enough for Heaven nor evil enough for Hell are stuck in limbo, held on Earth. Angels and Demons wage war against each other across the universe, trying to gain control where they can. They care not for the humans in limbo, for their souls won&amp;rsquo;t ever be released to them. As the Earth is removed of most humans, nature has decided to take back what is left, to consume the land with their plants once more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final Battle for earth begins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a strategy game for 2 - 5 players, where you build your base, gain resources, and send units to build or attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place on a 10 by 10 grid, with each player choosing a race, then placing them at the relevant starting location (dependent on the number of players). Each player then takes it in turns to spawn units, take two actions for each unit (move, build or attack), constructing buildings that will either give them money (for building and upgrades), weapon tokens (for attacking and defending) for creating more units (for making actions). Players can build in an empty space, so long as they have the resources, however if the space has an enemy building, they can attack+build (redemption!) to create a building of one level higher than that attacked (for the cost of a lower level building). After each player has taken a turn, you roll for obstacles (Meteorites, etc) which can land anywhere and destroy buildings, whilst also being &amp;quot;Redeemed&amp;quot; by players to give them an easy higher level building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each race has their own goal, such as to own the majority of the board, along with a unique ability that aids them in this goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has reached this goal, they win the game after one more round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
