							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jig Jump</name>
									
			<description>This c. 1940s game has an unusual mechanism: competitive jig-saw!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of six similar jig-saw puzzles. The images are the same, but the piece shapes for each puzzle are different. Each of the 36-piece puzzles has a row of frogs, alternately jumping and sitting on lily pads. When completed, they measure 23.5&amp;quot; long by 2.5&amp;quot; wide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as the start signal is given, each player tries to complete his jig-saw as quickly as possible, and the first one to finish wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alex G. Malloy (American Games) has a listing for &amp;quot;Jig Race by Arthur Dritz&amp;quot; (p. 79, #2988), by the same publisher, which either is his record of this game or represents another version of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
