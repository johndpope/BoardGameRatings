			<description>Althingi is a historical game for 3-5 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players compete against each other to become the icelandic lawspeaker by controlling the provinces and thus having more influence during the periodic trials which bring order as well as chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn new provinces are added in contest while players try to gain them through an auction. It will be with that provinces and the wise use of the few action cards you get every turn that you'll fight to win the later trials, which are won by the player with most influence points. At the end of the game, the player with most won trials will be the winner. Or at least will get more chances to be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
