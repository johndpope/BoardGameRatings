			<description>From The Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story Goal: Discover the heretic, who is secretly murdering his rivals in the Church with dark magick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Main Villain: Baron Guy du Cond&amp;eacute;, High Sheriff, who is secretly a heretic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Villain&amp;rsquo;s Allies: Constance du Fonc&amp;eacute; (an earth elemental), Soldiers under command of the Sheriff,&lt;br/&gt;Gargoyles (used as assassins).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genre, Time, Setting &amp;amp; Mood&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genre: Mystery&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time Period: 1559 A.D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting: Orl&amp;eacute;ans, France.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mood: Gothic horror/mystery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Backstory&lt;br/&gt;As the religious wars began to spread throughout France, Orl&amp;eacute;ans began to splinter into two powerful&lt;br/&gt;groups, one led by the Catholic Guise family, and the other led by the Protestant Cond&amp;eacute; family.&lt;br/&gt;Baron Guy du Cond&amp;eacute; is the Sheriff of Orl&amp;eacute;ans, and he also supports the Protestant cause, but he has chosen&lt;br/&gt;to fight the war on a much more subtle level. He has long studied the forbidden arts and has learned how to&lt;br/&gt;control the stone guardians adorning many of the buildings and churches in town. Most of the gargoyles&lt;br/&gt;have come under his control, and he has decided to assassinate important Catholic religious figures with&lt;br/&gt;these stone creatures. He hopes to discredit the Church by conducting these assassinations, since the stone&lt;br/&gt;guardians are supposed to protect the Church. Along the way, he has managed to accidentally energize an&lt;br/&gt;earth elemental, and this creature has taken human form. Constance du Fonc&amp;eacute; is an earth elemental, and&lt;br/&gt;she will use her influence to assist Guy in his endeavors. Constance appears to be an extremely beautiful&lt;br/&gt;woman, but she is a creature of nature. Guy is not aware of the attachment, but has gained unusual strength&lt;br/&gt;and he seems to be more attractive too. He has also managed to build a network of friends and allies&lt;br/&gt;among the Protestants, and he hopes to use them at the right moment to win the coming war in the town.&lt;br/&gt;Inscription at Fleury Abbey: &amp;quot;These that are learned shall shine as the brightness of the firmament: and&lt;br/&gt;they that instruct many to justice, as stars to all eternity&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
