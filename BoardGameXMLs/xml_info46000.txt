							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Rjurik Highlands</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winter wind screamed mercilessly outside the tribal longhouse. Inside, the clan huddled comfortably around a blazing fire and heard the heroic legends of the skalds. &amp;quot;On a night worse than this,&amp;quot; began the woman's tale, &amp;quot;our ancestors defeated the ice giant Gruumvok. The creature had already devoured their herds, smashed their village, and crippled some of their best warriors. But through their Rjurik cunning, the villagers tricked Gruumvok and sent him to his death. Gather close and learn from the wisdom of out ancestors....&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sprawling endlessly beyond the northern borders of Anuire, the Rjurik Highlands harbor undiscovered wonders, secrets, and dangers. Tracts of untouched mountains and forests offer breathtaking vistas; riches in the form of trade goods and untapped magical sources lie quietly for those brave enough to seize control of them; extreme weather and hostile humanoids await their chance to test any who might venture into these pristine lands. The frozen north offers challenges and prizes beyond compare - but only the most ambitious and stalwart will persevere!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion to the BIRTHRIGHT campaign setting contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Rjurik Highlands - A 96-page book covering the history, geography, political alliances, major characters, and tribes of the northern regions.&lt;br/&gt;     A full-color poster map of the Rjurik Highlands.&lt;br/&gt;     110 War Cards of new Rjurik and humanoid armies.&lt;br/&gt;     Six cardsheets of major Rjurik cities and player aids. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
