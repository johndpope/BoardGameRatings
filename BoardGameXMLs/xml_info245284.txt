			<description>Welcome to Murderopolis, detective! A place where there is a shitload of killing going down. It&amp;rsquo;s time to solve some murder cases, get paid, get laid, and get out alive&amp;mdash;if you can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How To Play&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle and deal each player 8 cards. If the &amp;quot;Death&amp;quot; card is dealt, the recipient is to exchange it for a new card, and it be inserted back into the deck. Set the deck face down between all participants. The player left of the dealer takes the first turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each turn, players draw 1 card and try to match 4 cards: the Suspect, Weapon, and Evidence cards featured on any Location card. Witness cards are wild and may be used in place of any Weapon or Evidence card. When a player has all 4 cards to make a match, he or she is to set it down on the playing surface, and announce a murder case has been solved. An opponent may inspect the cards to verify the match. If a player is unable to solve a case, and has more than 8 cards, he or she must discard 1 card into an open field of cards. Another player may take any discard, rather than drawing from the deck. A turn ends when a player solves a case, discards, or can do neither.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Death card is drawn, the player dies and is to add all cards held to the discard field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to solve 3 cases, wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
