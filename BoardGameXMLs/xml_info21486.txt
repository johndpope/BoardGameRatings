			<description>From the rulebook:  &amp;quot;Low Bidder is the business game that was originally developed for the 1964 Engineering Foundation Research Conference, and was initially presented in its session on 'The Strategy of Bidding.'&amp;quot;  Players bid on a number of randomly selected construction jobs.  The low bidder wins the job and receives his bid, but must then pay labor and material costs for the job.  Labor costs are modified by a random card draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though the game is explicitly listed as 2-25 players, it's noted that 3-8 makes the best game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
