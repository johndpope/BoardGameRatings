			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;All the excitement of the Hit TV Series ...and you're in the middle of it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are John Crichton, American Astronaut lost in space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are stranded on a hostile planet with an alien space babe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must find your crew, fight your enemies and get your ship back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interstellar Intrigue!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heinous Crimes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cosmic Justice! &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comments (gathered from various online sources): The game of the TV series, and with no introduction to the series universe, it's clearly designed for fans, with the original actors supplying the voices. Graphics and animation were not outstanding at the time, but were as good as most games of the type. The plater interface is typical of 3rd-person adventures, mostly clicking on locations, items or enemies with the mouse cursor to move, interact or fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plot involves a Peacekeeper takeover of Moya, the Leviathan ship, leaving Crichton &amp;amp; Chiana stranded on the planet below, and D'Ago, Aeryn, Rygel &amp;amp; Zhaan imprisoned on Moya (Pilot, of course, is also aboard, being physically bonded to the ship). This is explained before the game starts, so no spoilers there. As this crew roster suggests, it takes place during Season 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The normal screen view is an overhead 3rd-person RPG/adventure view, with the player controlling up to 3 characters, one primary, and up to 2 'Sidekicks' who operate semi-autonomously. Which characters are controlled varies through the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Common criticisms of the game centre around the thin plot and short play time, and the rather basic controls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
