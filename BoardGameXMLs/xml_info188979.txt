							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Escape From Lunar 7</name>
									
			<description>A cooperative game of survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your lunar prospecting mission has gone horribly wrong! Aliens have arrived and destroyed your ship and are attacking the lunar bases. You have evaded them for now, but need to get back to Earth. You head to Lunar 7, an old abandoned lunar base, hoping to find a still working ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just as you all manage to reach the landing pad and start moving into the base, the Alien ship finds you. It begins dropping aliens all over the base trying to find and prevent you from escaping. Now you must find the supplies you need to repair your ship and escape, all while trying to hold off the ever growing hoard of aliens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game is played as a cooperative game, with everyone helping to make sure all of you escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic game play: Each turn you have 3 action points which you use to move and explore (placing tiles), picking up and dropping off resources (energy cells) to power factory tiles that build repair parts. You collect the parts and take them back to your ship to repair it and escape the aliens. At the end of each turn you will draw an Alien card that tells which tile an alien lands on. When moving to a tile with aliens the player 'pushes' the aliens off that tile onto surrounding tiles. Anytime a tile has 4 or more aliens, the aliens destroy that tile (flip it over) and scatter to the adjacent tiles. This can lead to chain reaction where one tile being destroyed causes more tiles to be overloaded with aliens and destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
