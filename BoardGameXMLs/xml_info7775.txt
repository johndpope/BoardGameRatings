			<description>&amp;quot;Few fictional worlds have created the interest that has grown from the Mars of Edgar Rice Burroughs. As a world of constant warfare and adventure, it is naturally of special interest to the wargamer. In this area we are quite fortunate in the amount of information on military organization provided by Burroughs . . . The basic scale is decimal in nature. This means that each figure can represent ten men, one hundred men, or even one thousand men. This enables the same system of rules to deal with military operations that vary in size from small actions to the huge wars of survival often waged between major cities of Barsoom in which hundreds of thousands of fighting men are under arms on each side.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A separate set of rules is included for air-to-air actions between the &amp;quot;navies&amp;quot; of Barsoom which can be fought out on a hex grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The companion book John Carter Warlord of Mars Adventure Gaming Handbook was also released by Heritage. That booklet included a figure painting guide, descriptions of the various ethnic groups of Mars, and the Man-to-man Action Rules which provided for roleplaying and single combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
