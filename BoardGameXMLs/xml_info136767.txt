			<description>A puzzle game where you launch hamsters out of cannons to collect Golden Noms!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hamster Cannon is a physics-based puzzle game, in which the user combines and launches various hamsters out of cannons to collect Golden Noms. Each hamster is armed with their own special skills so it is up to you to navigate the levels with a myriad of different surfaces and contraptions that can react differently depending on which hamster is being used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you remember the boring ol&amp;rsquo; days when you had to feed your hamsters by hand like a sucker? Then you&amp;rsquo;d sit all day with your face pressed against the glass, waiting for them to wake up? Finally, at 3 a.m. you wake to the sound of their stupid, squeaky wheel?! Well&amp;hellip; not our hamsters! We&amp;rsquo;re taking control and feeding our hamsters in the only way that makes sense&amp;hellip; by shooting them out of CANNONS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, I guess our hamsters aren't exactly run of the mill, off the shelf-type hamsters. Here at Hamster Cannon, all of our hamsters have undergone stringent testing and thorough top-to-bottom inspections, which allow us to feel confident that only the finest hamsters will be shot from your cannon in search of Golden Noms. Rest assured that while they bounce off walls, smash through stone, and are set on fire, most of our esteemed hamsters don protective headgear such as stunt helmets and surprisingly safe hats made of TNT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can experience the amazing hamster-istry when you play, Hamster Cannon. Where else can you enjoy a physics-based puzzle game, in which the user combines and launches various hamsters out of cannons to collect Golden Noms? Each hamster is armed with their own special skills so it is up to you to navigate the levels with a myriad of different surfaces and contraptions that can react differently depending on which hamster is being used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
