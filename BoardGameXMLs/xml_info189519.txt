							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Troll! (Issue 1 - Oct 2008)</name>
									
			<description>From the intro:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the first issue of the Troll! fanzine - a zine for laid back gamers. This project started as random talks about wanting to &amp;ldquo;give something back&amp;rdquo; to the community in the chatrooms of Dragonsfoot (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.dragonsfoot.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.dragonsfoot.org&lt;/a&gt;, the 1st edition AD&amp;amp;D site all the contributors to the project hang out at) and soon we had a load of material to publish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We also had a lazy editor in chief that needed to be whipped by the contributors into doing anything productive. We also had an editor in chief who stole the batteries from his bluetooth mouse to his Wiimote (because there was beer to be drinkked and Tiger Woods to be played) and used that as an excuse for delays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The issue is named &amp;ldquo;Summer 08&amp;rdquo; even though it is already october. But we don&amp;rsquo;t care, it&amp;rsquo;s still summer to us, damnit!!!&amp;rdquo; or something. Anyway...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
