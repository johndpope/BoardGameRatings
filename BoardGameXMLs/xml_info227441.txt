			<description>In the timeless realm of the Greek gods, Zeus reigns supreme. His resentful brothers, Hades and Poseidon, often find themselves bored, and squabble about their lesser status. To settle matters, albeit temporarily, they occasionally wager on events in the human sphere. On this day, they&amp;rsquo;re betting for boasting rights on three separate races: a Greek chariot race c. 350 BC, a trail run in present-day Idaho, USA, and a space-faring contest at light-speed in the year 4017. Naturally, the sneaky duo will try to influence the outcome of the contests, while Zeus keeps a watchful eye on their activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wager of the Gods is unique in that players will simultaneously need to manage three distinct races, each with its own rigors and pitfalls. Movement is generated by multi-numbered chit draw; these numbers must be allocated to each of the three game boards. Naturally there are occasional special actions -- and just the right amount of strategy for a tense and fun two-player game. The player who wins two of the three races wins the day!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;  3 Game Boards&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 70 Action Counters&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;  6 Player Tokens in two colors&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;  4 Galaxy Counters&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;  8 Whip Counters&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;  6 Ram Counters&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;  1 Dolphin Counter &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;  2 Reference Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
