			<description>Little Storm Thinks is a children's game. The players are each given one wooden stick of each colour. Then one by one they roll a die with different colours on the sides, and got to take a wooden stick of that colour they get on the die. Each player also have a card (thought card) with a figure on, and have to make their figure on the card with there wooden sticks. After the dice roll a player can place as many sticks on the card that is possible. There are three versions to play the game. The easy game is played with the white thought cards. A figure is complete when the wooden sticks are in the correct places (as shown on the thought card). The difficult game is played with the coloured thought cards. A figure is not complete unless the wooden sticks are in the same colours and in the correct places as shown on the thought card. There is also a cooperative game version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
