			<description>This board game has been published together with two other polish games &amp;quot;Gierki Małżeńskie and &amp;quot;Kariera Polityczna&amp;quot; in a series of games illustrated by famous cartoonist Andrzej Mleczko. All three titles are lightweight party games with simple mechanics accompanied by amusing cartoons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Korporacja (&amp;quot;Corporation&amp;quot;) players assume the roles of employees trying to climb the career ladder by moving around and solving certain tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move about the game board (representing a corporation) by die rolls, receive cards with tasks from superiors in form of cards, and then have to perform these tasks. Tasks are a combination of mini-games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the successful navigation around obstacles and completion of tasks they move up the corporate ladder up to the top. Players can hinder other players in the completion of their tasks with certain action cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
