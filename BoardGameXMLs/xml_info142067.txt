							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Penguin Pals&#039; Passing Puzzle</name>
									
			<description>Each player will lead a team of penguins through an icy passage to reach the other, colder, side.&lt;br/&gt;Each player must lead his 5 penguin pals to the opposing side of a 5x5 board. Each space may or may not contain an ice block, and penguins may only land on these blocks, but may swim across one iceless space. Players take turns in which they either move a penguin, move an ice block or draw action cards, which anyone can play at any time.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to be the first to get all five penguins across, which requires you to move forward while blocking the others' passage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
