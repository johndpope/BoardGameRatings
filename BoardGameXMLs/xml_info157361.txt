							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">General Equipment Lists</name>
									
			<description>from the A Few Notes on the Lists:&lt;br/&gt;I have always liked equipping the characters I play, and dressing the dungeons and buildings that surround the players in my games. From my earliest times, spent hand copying equipment lists from fanzines, supplements and rulebooks, to the latest PDF age, I just plain enjoy a good wander through the lists. I am not an expert in weaponry, so arms are armour are not included, neither are items with magical properties and other special items, these will be covered in other supplements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LLA006-General Equipment Lists is the culmination of decades of RPG, and re-enactment experience, and released under the Open Games Licence for everyone to use. It contains lists of the mundane items that make up a guide to price, weight and description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
