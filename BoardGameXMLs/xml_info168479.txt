							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lunte: Guy with Match</name>
									
			<description>Lunte: Guy with Match is an additional card for the game Lunte, which can be played (out off sequence) immediately after a defuse card is played, thus reactivating the fuse (the cards are no longer discarded).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lunte is a fast paced card game, in which players add cards to a burning fuse, until someone detonates a bomb or extinguishes the fire. The aim of the game is to accumulate the highest number of points, by choosing the right moment to detonate or extinguish the burning fuse. Detonated bombs gain the player points, whereas extinguished cards are removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lunte: Guy with Match card is a promo card that was first released at Spiel '14, in Essen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
