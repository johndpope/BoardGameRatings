			<description>Commando Libya is a shooter game for the Commodore 64, created by Robert Pfitzner in 1986. Although the title screen gives the game's complete title as Commando Libya Part I, a part II was never released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's objective consists of aiming a machine gun turret to fire at enemies running across the screen. While these figures appear to carry weaponry, they aren't the ones representing the actual danger, but occasionally, bombs would appear and slowly approach the bottom of the screen, and unless fired at, explode and thus end the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Commando Libya&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
