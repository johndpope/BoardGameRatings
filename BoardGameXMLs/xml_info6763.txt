			<description>It's a simulation of basketball game. There are two fields in the box, so it's possible to play two matches together.&lt;br/&gt;Every 3 seconds of virtual time the player can have an action with one of his players. They can throw, pass, move with the ball, move without the ball, try to steal the ball.&lt;br/&gt;After a missed throw it is possible to get the rebound and start a new action.&lt;br/&gt;The players have some special attitudes that make them specialists in rebounds, defending, passing, throwing or moving with the ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
