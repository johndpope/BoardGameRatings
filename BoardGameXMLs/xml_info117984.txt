							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The One True King</name>
									
			<description>The King is dead and three powerful Lords vie for the throne. They will use everything in their power to win (Military Power, Allies, Knights, Nobles, Spies, the church, mercenaries, whatever it takes). Although 3 contend for the crown, in the end there can only be ONE TRUE KING!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, each player plays out 3 columns of cards consisting of Knights, Nobles, Allies, and Army units.  The total strengths of the columns are compared.  Then, Intrigue Cards are played to change the balance of power.  Intrigue Cards include assassinations, bribery, desertions, reserves, etc. The final column strengths are revealed and the player who wins 2 of the 3 columns is the victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
