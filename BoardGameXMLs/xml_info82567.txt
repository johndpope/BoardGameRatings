							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blaster Master: Overdrive</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blaster Master: Overdrive is a sequel to the original Blaster Master game for download from the Wii store. Overdrive stays true to many of the features that made Blaster Master such a popular game and was designed with 16 bit graphics. The player controls Alex, who has at his disposal the shapeshifting and upgradable vehicle S.O.P.H.I.A. Earth has been infected by a virus that has turned animals into flesh-eating mutants, and Alex needs to fight his way through them to find the source. Overdrive plays similarly to the Metroid games, having a large environment to explore but needing various upgrades to allow access to certain areas. The gameplay switches between the side-view platform when Alex is in S.O.P.H.I.A and the overhead camera when Alex is exploring smaller areas and fighting bosses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
