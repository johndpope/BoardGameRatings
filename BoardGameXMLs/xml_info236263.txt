							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bushido: Dafukaia &amp; Kami of Burning Anger</name>
									
			<description>Not all those children raised in the monasteries and taught the teachings of Subarashi Baransu are able to complete their training, return to their homes and continue the cycle that has been in place since the beginning of memory. Dafukaia was a promising student, however the gnawing rage that burns inside him stoked by an unknown trauma could not be dowsed by the secrets of the temple. Despite many attempts to help and guide the boy, the masters could not risk letting him continue his training such was the ferocity of his temper. So when the teenager was cast out he had no choice but to travel to the city to try and survive and survive he did. A natural fighter who has since used his teaching in the martial arts to earn his living. In the Silvermoon he has found his family and acceptance that had eluded him for so long. The Oyabun encouraging his fiery talent, unleashing Dafukaia like a fireball on those who have slighted them. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
