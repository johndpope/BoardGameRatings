			<description>Authors blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the Great War. Combat roars across the globe, in the air, on and under both the land and the sea. Men are fighting hand to hand, with blades, rifles and machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's amongst these massive armies that a few good men and true rise up to take the lead. When the line is breached, when the ship is sinking, when the bombers are dropping their loads, is when heroes come to the fore. A man stands up and cheers his fellows on while leading the charge, such a man will be your character in this role playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
