			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This society is perfect. Except for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perfect, Unrevised is a game about criminals within a Dystopian society. It&amp;rsquo;s about what makes them tick, the crimes they commit, the goals they strive for, and the persecution they may well face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll like this game if: you want to fight the man (but understand that it might hurt), you adore the rebel spirit, you like intensely antagonistic games, you want to tell stories about mindfucking hypnotists, you want to tell stories about secret societies, you want a rigidly-structured game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s like Kafka and Charlotte Bronte had children, and those children wrote Blade Runner.&amp;rdquo; -Malcolm Craig, author of Cold City &amp;amp; Hot War&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What I like about Perfect most is that it really knows what it&amp;rsquo;s about. You&amp;rsquo;re all playing criminals, but your crimes are automatic &amp;mdash; you don&amp;rsquo;t try to commit crimes, you commit crimes. Rebellion, ultimately, is the easy part. It&amp;rsquo;s afterwards where the game puts its full weight and attention, as play and system revolve around the questions of &amp;ldquo;Do you get caught?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;What do they do to you?&amp;rdquo; Rebellion against the Dystopia is rarely done so clearly.&lt;br/&gt;    -Fred Hicks, author of Don&amp;rsquo;t Rest Your Head &amp;amp; The Dresden Files RPG&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Listen, Perfect is one of my 3 or 4 favorite games of all time. At a time when I was pretty much giving up gaming Perfect reminded me what good gaming and good game design was. It&amp;rsquo;s awesome, and totally worth your time. Whatever your favorite game is, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure Perfect is better.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;    -Jake Richmond, author of Panty Explosion &amp;amp; Ocean&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
