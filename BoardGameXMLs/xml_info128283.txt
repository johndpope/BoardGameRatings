							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Clang!: Bloodthirsty Beasts</name>
									
			<description>BLOODTHIRSTY BEASTS is the first expansion to the Clang! CORE ARMY PACK&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has one Beast Hunter card.  Instead of fighting or talking with their Troops (standard Clang! rules), players can instead choose to send out their Beast Hunters to search for Beasts that they can use to attack the enemy.  They can only do this if they are the player leading the battle, and only if they were also leading in the previous game turn.  Sending out the Beast Hunters means they surrender the lead (to the player on their left)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the turn that that player regains the lead, their Beast Hunters return with a Beast (top card from the pile).  They can use this Beast to fight the enemy, but only if they have their Beast Hunters with their army (not out beast hunting), as they need these to goad the Beast into battle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is best to use Beasts to attack players who have no Beasts themselves, or whose Beast Hunters are out looking for monsters, as they will have to defend using their Troops rather than a Beast&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beasts can fight Beasts, using standard Clang! fighting rules, and Beasts can fight Troops, again using the standard rules, but only red attack bars can affect Beasts, so they are hard to defeat.  If a player has fewer than three red combat bars amongst the hand of four Troops they have to choose from, they are doomed to lose, so it is best to pick the three weakest Troops to send to their destruction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some Beasts have Special Attacks - these could depend on Troops having a certain level of bar for a skill such as Bravery or they all run away from the beast, or could mean looking at the Troop pictures so for instance any Troops without shields cannot defend themselves against the Special Attack and are defeated&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beasts can help turn the tide of battle, intimidate other players, or add a final blow to win the war, but Beasts themselves do not count towards Troop totals so if your Troops are defeated you lose&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;BLOODTHIRSTY BEASTS gamebox&lt;br/&gt;Beasts (1 deck of 16 cards)&lt;br/&gt;Beast Hunters (1 deck of 6 cards)&lt;br/&gt;Instructions (1 deck of 3 cards)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
