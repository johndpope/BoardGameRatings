			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyber Troopers: Virtual-On Force is a Japanese 3D Mech fighting game originally released in arcades. The game has since been scheduled to be re-released on the Xbox 360. The game focuses on tactical combat between large Mechs and shares many similarities with the other games in the series, but Virtual-On Force differs in that it features four player matches in a 2 vs. 2 format. In order to maintain game balance while adding the complexity of additional fighters, the game uses a much simplified combat engine to its predecessors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Xbox 360 edition stays true to the base game with the same gameplay style, and includes most of the features from the arcade version. Xbox Live support is included to allow players to play online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
