			<description>In Divine Empire, the players are gods. Their target goal is a predetermined level of civilization. Each god has to reach this level as soon as possible.&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is stuffed with battles, magic and technology. The multiplayer version also adds a serious amount of backstabbing...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play the game with a starter deck (76 cards) for each player. More cards were available in booster packs of 12 cards each. Cards had different rarities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plans were made to publish English and Dutch versions. Unfortunately the Chinese market back then was not what it is today. We're talking about 1997 and distribution of the game was the ultimate nemesis that led to the demise of this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
