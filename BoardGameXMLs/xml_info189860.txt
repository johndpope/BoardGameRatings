			<description>This board game without a board consists of excitement, challenges, and strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game, which is easy to play but not so easy to win, is very different than any other card game and different every time it is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may have the best card at the table to win, but at the draw of the command cards, your card is gone from your hand. Who has it now? Maybe you know, maybe you don't, maybe another player knows, or maybe you can get it back in time to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It all depends on how the cards fall. Try it, you'll love it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
