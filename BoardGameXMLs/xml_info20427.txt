			<description>FERIENSPIEL JUNGFRAUREGION is a Swiss game that has more than a little of Monopoly about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players progress around the board according to die rolls.  When landing on property squares players hae the option of electing to purchase them from the bank, though larger properties cannot be purchased until the three smaller properties in the same set (of four) have been sold.  As in Monopoly other players landing on property that you own have to pay a charge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Random elements are thrown in through squirrel and clover cards which are generally of the go to..., pay the bank..., get from the bank... type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2,000 Fr are received for passing through square 70 (not START), but the principle is the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no houses or hotels to buy, but fimilair rules for mortgages, credit and bankrupcy apply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player, who after two hours (or other pre-determined limit) has the most money (cash and property less bank loans).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
