			<description>FROM THE PUBLISHER&amp;quot;S INTRODUCTION (EXCEPTS):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skirmish! is a quick-to-learn, easy-to-set-up game of combat that can be played using almost any miniatures figures.  The point of this game is to simulate small-scale battles and to play as well as possible and to have fun, win or not.&lt;br/&gt;Skirmish! is intended for both veteran and novice players.  It is simple enough to be a beginner's first wargame, and versatile and expandable enough to satisfy more experienced gamers, especially those who want to pull out some of their old toy soldiers out of a footlocker or the closet and use them in a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skirmish! is designed for simplicity and playability.  The basic rules can be read, a handful of soldiers selected, and a game set up in about 20 minutes, and in much less time than that for players already familiar with the rules.  And, while their emphasis is on playability, these rules allow for consistency, taking the gaming action up at least a few steps from merely &amp;quot;playing soldiers&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Would-be hardcore gamers mau complain that these rules are not &amp;quot;realistic&amp;quot;.  Sure they are.  They are just exceptionally streamlined, and in the spirit of &amp;quot;playing soldiers&amp;quot; are simple and flexible.  There are no cumbersome charts or combat matrices, no supporting papaerwork to keep track of a game in play, and a minimum of simple tables.  Most attacks can be completely resolved with a simple roll of the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anything beyond the basic rules is optional.  With the incorporation of selected optional rules, Skirmish! can be made as complex as is enjoyable for the players.  Most players will eventually, if not initially, want to use some of the optional rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From RPGnow.com:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is part of a thematic series of works on miniatures wargaming published by Skirmisher that includes the H.G. Wells books Little Wars and Floor Games, the company&amp;rsquo;s spinoff Little Orc Wars rules, and the Quactica miniatures rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
