			<description>The movie is divided into a number of story episodes, between which the user interacts with the story in various ways. After viewing a story episode, users are asked a series of questions by Dr. Turner to test their perception of what they have seen. Users are then allowed to navigate through a graphic reconstruction of the Overton house, where they may gather additional details of the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was originally produced with the intention of releasing the game under the Trilobyte label, but Landeros was fired from the company before it was released. Tender Loving Care was later released under Landeros's new company, Aftermath Media, on CD-ROM, with the option for users to watch the movie as a feature-length film as opposed to interacting with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tender_Loving_Care_%28video_game%29 Tender Loving Care (video game)]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
