							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Head Honcho: Jet Combat Over the Yalu</name>
									
			<description>Head Honcho is an introductory level mini-game on air combat set during the early years of the Korean War. The game is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh, with graphics by Bruce Yearian, and is published by High Flying Dice Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Head Honcho: Jet Combat over the Yalu is also the Consimworld Donation Drive Gold Level game for 2015. Head Honcho features such aircraft as the F-86, the F-84, F9F Panther and other aircraft of the war, all battling the Communist MiG-15s for air supremacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Head Honcho is not meant to be the most accurate of air warfare simulations. Rather, players should find this an entertaining diversion that still captures the &amp;ldquo;essence&amp;rdquo; of the violent and tense nature of Korean War jet combat. Similar to other minigames using this design (Dueling Eagles, Fighting Eagles), I also hope Head Honcho serves as a vehicle by which newcomers to the hobby of simulation gaming can be introduced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
