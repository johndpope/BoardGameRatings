			<description>Last Seven Days is a solitaire card game with a story theme from a Japanese indie publisher. The game consists of a deck of cards; each turn the player draws as many face-down cards as he likes from the deck and applies them to two of five locations. The locations' special effects may or may not be activated depending on the cards drawn. The player then sets these cards up on a timeline, following certain number restraints. After seven days have been completed this way, the player may choose to end the game and count points, or to loop the week to try to improve his points by adding and/or replacing cards on the timeline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The completed games forms a &amp;quot;story&amp;quot; of the last week of the world, which characters the player encountered, and what finally happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last Seven Days allows for cooperative play if two card sets are available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
