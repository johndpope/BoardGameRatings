			<description>From the publisher's website&lt;br/&gt;(&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.incitefulentertainment.com/perfect.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.incitefulentertainment.com/perfect.php&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A world where colour is banned...where love is against the law...This is the world of Perfect, and this is where you live.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perfect is a roleplaying game rooted in a world akin to Victorian England, but which is under a harsh and Dystopic reign of terror. Laws are constricting to the point of absurdity, and status and fashion have turned into legally-regulated modes of oppression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters you play are people who can&amp;rsquo;t just settle into this system. You feel a deep-rooted discontent and distrust of the government and society around you. You begin to walk against the current, bending and breaking laws as you do so.&lt;br/&gt;Whether it is curiosity, bitterness, love or hatred that drives you, you cannot rest at ease until something is done. The Inspectors, men dressed in black suits, sit at every street corner. They watch you, they wait for you to slip up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a world where colour is banned. This is a world where love is against the law.&lt;br/&gt;This is the world of Perfect, and this is where you live.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
