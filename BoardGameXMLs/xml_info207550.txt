							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chronicles of Aerthe Quick-Start Guide</name>
									
			<description>Publishers Blurb&lt;br/&gt;Arete is where it all begins. A rebuilt world 50 years after the Convergence, echoes of other worlds have changed Aerthe&amp;rsquo;s landscape. Forests exist within deserts and cities abide by different laws of both nature and magic due to realities merging together. This is a place where dragons roam the skies and magic can be both dangerous and beneficial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The continent is ruled by the Cleric Lords and their Faith Militant&amp;mdash;corrupt, overzealous puritans who hunt down any that oppose the Faiths laws and power. The Guilds battle amongst themselves for wealth and control over the cities and trade. Secretly they work together to fund and train the Archons, a specialized unit of agents created to exist in any reality and to be the front-line in the inevitable war against the Faith.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fractures in reality act as gateways to other Aerthe's, these may be ruled by different laws of magic and physics, they may have experienced disasters that have turned them into Ice, desert or dead worlds. Each new realm will bring new races and religions, new monsters and enemies. As characters you can explore these new worlds or exist within them, the options are endless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watching from betwixt the parallel, lurking in the empty spaces that holds the web of reality together, are the Dark Gods. These malicious and cunning beings wait as the fabric of matter weakens, approaching the time when they can descend to take their rightful place as rulers of the Aerthe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must pick your side or choose to feed off both, but whatever you decide, destiny cannot be avoided. The fate of the Tapestry of Worlds is in your hands,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
