							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Peter Gunn Detective Game</name>
									
			<description>The Peter Gunn Detective Game is based on the highly successful Peter Gunn Television series from the early 1960's.  Craig Stevens' character features prominently on the box of this licensed board game for kids 7-14.  Each player takes a piece and start in the center of the board.  A face-down person (Mr. Aay, Mr. Bee, Mr. Cee, Mr. Dee) and a face-down weapon (hammer, gun, knife, poison) are laid about on the board, and each player gets 2 cards, one showing which person to find, and one showing which weapon to find.  Players spin the spinner to move around the board, looking at the face-down pieces in each area until they find the 2 on their cards.  They then return to the center, reveal their cards, and tell the other players where their weapon and person are on the board.  If they succeed, they win!  If they declare wrong they are eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
