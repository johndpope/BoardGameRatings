			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ingenious game can be played either as a board game or as a roleplaying game, using the same components.  In the roleplaying game, the board serves as an area map and the character spinners are used as (small) character sheets.  Various cards used during board game play are used by the game master, in roleplaying, to generate adventure happenings and ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can also be used both way as a method to introduce inexperienced or, especially, younger players to the concepts of the game as a board game and then transition to a roleplaying game in an already-familiar setting with already-familiar characters and adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
