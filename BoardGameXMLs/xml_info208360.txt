							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Venture Party</name>
									
			<description>Venture Party is a fun and simple, 3-7 player, hand management game. Fantasy themes and RPG tropes are turned on their heads in this game full of clumsy and unfortunately ill-fated heroes. Your job, as leader of your Venture Party, is to decide which characters are putting their lives on the line for the team. Discard the unlucky heroes and collect loot to build the strongest party! With the new 16 card built in expansion pack, there is even more potential for mayhem before you reach the bottom of the deck! The land is ripe with opportunity, and only one Venture Party will come out on top. Will it be yours?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins by dealing 2 Party Members, and 1 Loot Token to every player. At the start of each player turn, they must draw one party member and play one party member from their hand. These heroes are disposable, each with a Power Level value from 1 to 16. Every number has varying effects depending on their Power Level (gathering loot, removing player cards, look at a players hand etc.) Since a Loot Token adds +1 to your party's overall power, Loot handling can sometimes make the difference between the winning and losing parties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WINNING: When the deck runs out the game is over. You want to end the game with the strongest venture party. The strength of your party is determined by combining the numbers on your cards with the number of loot tokens you have you your possession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ex: If Pedro has the Necromancer (Level 12) and the Blind Monk (Level 6) and 5 Loot, his score is&lt;br/&gt;12 + 6 + 5 =23&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
