							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Olympiade Spillet</name>
									
			<description>Olympiade Spillet is a quiz game about the Olympics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It contains 1.000 questions about the Summer Olympics from 1896 till 2000 (excluding the unofficial 1906 games). They are divided into 5 categories: Ceremony and ritual (blue), sports (yellow), Danes in the Olympics (red), athletics (green) and legends (orange).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be played by 2 to 5 players or teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player/team rolls a die by turn and then has to answer a question in the category rolled. If you answer correctly you will receive a marker in the same color. If your answer is wrong nothing happens and the next player gets his turn. The object of the game is to collect a marker of each color. If you roll a color that you already have you will loose your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sixst side of the die is blank. Whenever this is rolled a punishment will be dealt. Who will receive this punishment is decided by spinning an Olympic torch. What the punishment is can be decided from game to game. Usually it is to loose a marker or your turn but for party games it can be getting a round for the table or something similar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
