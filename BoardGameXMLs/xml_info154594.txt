			<description>Story: By treading the path through this labyrinth, the players enter the undiscovered world of their own being...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Essence: Im Labyrinth des Lebens (Essence: In The Labyrinth Of Life) transforms the card game into a board game and provides it with an atmospheric game board, which replaces the pathway cards of the base game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the use of two dice, the players still have the possibility to choose between two options. Newly added are actions for the centre of the labyrinth and for the encounter of meeples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who reaches the centre decides if the game is continued or ends immediately. In this case, essence points are counted and the winner is determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameboard is made of tarpaulin which makes it rollable, waterproof and very durable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
