			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Pub Battles: Antietam, players fight in this final battle of Lee's 1862 invasion of the north. This system is know for:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     fast play time (1.5 hours)  &lt;br/&gt;     simple rules (1 page quick start rules)&lt;br/&gt;     stunning components (real canvas period map with hardwood kriegsspiel style blocks.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units move by Corps in random order (chit pull).  Your HQs can attempt to alter this sequence.  This recreates the random chaos of battlefields.   Players must watch for timing opportunities / threats; and be able to adapt their plans to battlefield conditions. You can order your troops forward but you can&amp;rsquo;t be certain WHEN they will move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no hexes or areas in this game.  Pieces simply move mini style across the terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No CRT.  Players simply roll dice to score hits in combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Confederates are badly out numbered but in good defensive terrain.  With their backs to the uncrossible Potomac river, there was only 1 route of escape to the south.  If the Federals can cut this link, Lee's army will be forced to surrender, ending the war early.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-&amp;quot;Antietam  was a blast!  This battle is like a bare knuckle, back alley brawl!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play in multiplayer teams (up to 14 players) with each player controlling 1 or more Corps with restricted communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
