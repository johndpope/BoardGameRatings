							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cheating Death</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death is always lurking in the furthest reaches of space: a laser strike, a Star Sword chop, the maw of an alien beast, an exploding starship &amp;ndash; all of these and many more circumstances can kill even the mightiest character. However, many heroes and villains of sci-fi novels, films and video games do not die as easily. Sometimes, a hero may have his hand chopped off, later to be replaced by a cybernetic prosthetic; sometimes a villain falls into a sea of lava and later has his burnt, broken body repaired by advanced technology; sometimes a policeman, or a secret military operative, may cheat death by large-scale cybernetic modifications replacing broken flesh and bones with chromium and hardened steel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To simulate these stories and bring them to your gaming table, we offer you with these rules &amp;ndash; intended to give the great heroes and villains of your game a second chance, typically carrying a terrible price. These new, optional rules have three components. The first is Resuscitation &amp;ndash; the possibility of reviving a mortally injured character despite him or her falling to 0 Hit Points. This, of course, could have very bad implications to the character, as few come unscathed out of such injury. The second is Cyborg Conversion &amp;ndash; bringing a dead character back to life with advanced cybernetics, usually with negative side effects. The third and final is Bio Reconstruction&amp;ndash; rebuilding a dead person from scratch with ultra-advanced biotech, provided that the brain remained more or less intact; this also has potential side-effects, of course, as rising from the dead usually comes at a price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The supplement includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Mortal wounds and resuscitation&lt;br/&gt;     Repairing &amp;quot;dead&amp;quot; robots&lt;br/&gt;     Bringing back the dead as cyborgs&lt;br/&gt;     Rebuilding your body from scratch with Bio Reconstruction!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
