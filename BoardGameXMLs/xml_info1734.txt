			<description>EPICUS is a fantasy /strategy/ collectible table top board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who needs computer games when you can have hours of fun coercing your friends to &amp;quot; help kill the others&amp;quot;, and then meet up with him later to settle. Alliances are to be made and broken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will the wizard favor you on your next role? Will he be indifferent? Or, worse yet, will he look unfavorably upon you?&lt;br/&gt;Only the wizard knows.........&lt;br/&gt;Utilize the wizards spells, get your own powers, surround troops, battle in the field, throw arrows, transport troops, .... attack!!!!!!&lt;br/&gt;This is a table top, real leather game board with a unique grid pattern silkscreened on the suede side. Custom icon pieces are 100% lead-free pewter and one of our own design, the troop pieces were made for ease in handling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game definitely brings out your personality. Try and strategize, you will find the game changes every round of play. The outcome is never the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
