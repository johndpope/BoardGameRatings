			<description>From the game's introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You are a grotesque thing.   A patchwork of fur, scales, and scabrous skin cover your twisted frame from which ungainly limbs sprout at unlikely angles.  Blood drenched claws burst from your many hands and feet and your mouth is full of razor sharp teeth.  Yesterday you had a shell and bulging muscles.  But   tomorrow, tomorrow you will be beautiful.  The Innocent has promised you that tomorrow you will be beautiful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;All things that dwell upon the expanse are constantly in a state of change, moving, like you, from one state to the next.   The base, un-speaking animals change their form to match their changing needs and environment.  Legs growing long to flee the predator.  Teeth growing sharp when green &lt;br/&gt;food grows scarce.  Those who still can speak change  to meet   their needs and also to reflect their moods and desires.  Those who think and see more deeply change at will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;All things change, in the face of the irresistible will of the Innocents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;All things, even you.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
