			<description>OESE is a game about travelling across the galaxy in search of a planet to colonize. Along the way, you'll encounter various alien races, unexplored planets, asteroid fields, old satellites and many others to shape your journey and lead you down a unique path to your new home. Assigned a ship of 50 loyal crew members, you must make choices that determine the outcome of these encounters in an effort to make peace with your neighbours in the universe. Through research and a few useful ship modifications, you will gain more and more control over the outcomes of the encounters you face. Making friends might not be so easy when you're low on power and the only way to get some is to take out a Xenerian. Perhaps if you show an enemy compassion they will send someone to help repair your ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;â€‹OESE is about decisions and consequences. Good luck captain...get out there and earn your place in the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
