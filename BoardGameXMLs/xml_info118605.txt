			<description>In Scout: Rechen-Hexe, players are witches who try to combine ingredients to fill their cauldrons to the proper level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has her own set of tiles numbered 1-10, with each tile being 1-10 units long. Players are presented with an easy target (a number up to ten) or a hard target (a number between 11-20), then they stack at least two tiles (for an easy target) or three or more (for a hard target) inside their personal witches' tower. Once a player does so, she grabs one of the available witch chips; the last player can't get one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all players have finished constructing their towers, they flip their towers over to look at the cutout in the back to see whether their stack of tiles is as tall as the target number. If so, they advance their token on the track to the next space matching the color of the witch chip they took.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends the round that one or more witches reach the house at the end of the track. Those players win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
