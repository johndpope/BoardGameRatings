			<description>Goal: Be the first to get rid of all taken 'Dominoes'-cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game consists of 2 black/red dice and 78 cards, which show two different sides - halfway through&lt;br/&gt;printed in red and black with symbols from 1 to 6, infrequently a joker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Each player draws 6 cards&lt;br/&gt;2. Roll the dice: If someone owns a card with matching symbols he/she may start putting this side up in the middle of the table. If no one has a matching card all the players must draw an additional one and roll the dice again.&lt;br/&gt;3. Now proceed adding your cards by turn according 'Dominoes', but you must roll the dice first or you choose the dice result of your predecessor: Only the those numbers can be placed with matching numbers to cards on the table AND on the dice; a Joker may be placed at any combination. During your turn you may add further cards, which have to match with cards on the table only.&lt;br/&gt;4. If you have finished your turn draw a new card from the pile&lt;br/&gt;5. Check the dice results of the other players carefully; if you possess a  matching card the turn is yours, as long as you are quick enough&lt;br/&gt;6. Placing your last card on the table - you win&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
