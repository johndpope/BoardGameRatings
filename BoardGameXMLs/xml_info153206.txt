			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a part of Bureau 8, a secret branch of the FBI that investigates the cases that the FBI can't. Last night, one of the Bureau's contacts, a mortician, called into the field office saying he has something that needs to be seen. After arriving, you see what he means; he has a guy on the slab with a double arm transplant and a pocket full of clues. You are to investigate what's going on, solve the problem, come back safe, but above all, keep it quiet!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll need every tool in your arsenal, every skill, and even then, you might lose some agents out there!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supernatural adventure comes with partially pre-generated characters, giving the players a base Agent that they can expand upon and put points into skills of their choice! If the players and Narrator choose, they could scrap the entire Bureau 8 feature and be ghost hunters in their own right!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside, you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for adding supernatural elements to &amp;AElig;ther&lt;br/&gt;     Partially pre-generated characters to get you into the action faster&lt;br/&gt;     Complete rules for all of the supernatural action you'll be diving into&lt;br/&gt;     Hooks for expanding the adventure turning it from a one-shot into a story arc&lt;br/&gt;     A lethal adventure that will challenge beginner and veteran gamers alike!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
