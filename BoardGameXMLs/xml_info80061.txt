			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Detroit is a challenging business simulation that puts you in control of your own car company! As president of the company from 1908 through 2008, you'll begin with enough cash and a prototype of one car. It's up to you to use the latest in automotive technology to produce the cars that the public will love and the competition will envy! Then create your own marketing campaign (from lots of options) to help sell your creations to the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can even design your own cars! Decide what your car is going to look like, and what parts you'll include! Here's your chance to make your own dream car... so long as you have the technology and the cash to pay for it! Then put your masterpiece through its paces with a series of grueling tests. Sophisticated formulae calculate fuel efficiency, performance and many other statistics for you. When you're happy with it and it meets any government regulations of the time, you can start the assembly lines rolling!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As your automobile empire grows, decide when and where to open up new factories and sales offices throughout the world. Hire new employees and invest in research and development to keep your creations on the cutting edge! With hard work and dedication, you could become one of the wealthiest and most powerful figures in automotive history! But don't just think about doing it. It's time to get behind the wheel of your own company car and drive your way to fame and fortune!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
