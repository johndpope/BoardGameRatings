Over the course of the game, the seasons change, and players gain abilities based on the season, allowing them to recruit figures into their armies and raise their rank; all while keeping the other player?s forces from getting too large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rank is a card game featuring easy to grasp rules coupled with deep strategy.  Each of the various cards enable five separate actions, depending on the phase, or season, the game is currently in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first Edition of Rank, and is presented in a portable Small Box box, and each of the 25 available copies are signed and numbered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.smallboxgames.com/rank.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.smallboxgames.com/rank.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
