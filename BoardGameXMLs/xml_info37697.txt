			<description>In Imaginez (French for &amp;quot;Imagine&amp;quot;), players try to associate cards in their hands with one of the 12 cards on the board. Cards represent either objects, animals, places, country, well-known persons, etc. There must be a direct link between the two cards you are trying to associate. There is a score (from 1 to 3 ) on each card. Each time you successfully associate two cards, you score the total of the cards. First to 50 wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example: &amp;quot;Napoleon&amp;quot; is on the board and you have the &amp;quot;Corsica&amp;quot; card. Since Napoleon was born there you could associate to these two cards. Later on, you could put &amp;quot;Island&amp;quot; card on Corsica (since it's an island), then maybe the &amp;quot;Treasure&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Treasure Island&amp;quot;), etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
