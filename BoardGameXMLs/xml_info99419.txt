			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;On their cross-pacific trip to the International Highschooler Summit, twelve teenagers find themselves stranded on a remote island with no sign of civilization.&lt;br/&gt;All dice rolled are six-sided dice or d6s with the exception of rolling on Event tables, which use two six-sided dice to generate the two digits of a d66 roll. For example, rolling a 2 followed by a 4 would give a d66 roll of 24.&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played alone or, preferably, in a group. There is no need for a Gamesmaster or Referee but someone will need to keep track of the Castaways and Resources as well as playing. The players could take turns controlling the Castaways each day, divide them amongst themselves or simply discuss the best action to take each day. Working out how the group will cooperate is part of the game.&lt;br/&gt;The most obvious way to get off the island is to gather Wood, using it to build a camp and eventually a raft. However, other opportunities will appear throughout the course of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
