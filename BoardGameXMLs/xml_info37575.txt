			<description>&amp;quot;Card game for 2-4+ players. Napoleon Dynamite School Election Theme. Each player has a 'Nerdy' candidate that is running for school president.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player tracks three statistics: Time, Money, and Votes. Card play can add to your stats and cause an opponent's stats to decrease. In addition, some cards require that the play incur a time or money loss in order to be played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game ends at the end of the turn in which the last card has been drawn from the deck. The player with the most votes at the end of the game wins.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
