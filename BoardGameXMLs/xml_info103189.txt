			<description>Flipping Crazy is an Othello (or Reversi if you prefer) like game that uses a hexagonal board for play.  Players place and move pieces in an attempt to have the most of their own color on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can expand from current piece locations, or move already played pieces 2 spaces away.  Players take opponents pieces by being adjacent to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When no more moves can be made, the player with the most of pieces on the board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
