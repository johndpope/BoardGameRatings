			<description>Conquest of the Ring, &amp;quot;A Middle Earth Game for the entire family&amp;quot; by Hobbit Toys and Games, Inc., 1311 Healy Street, Kalamazoo, Michigan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conquest of the Ring is a fast action pursuit game in which each of two to four players compete for the ONE Ring of Power.  Located in the center of the playing board, the Ring waits to be claimed by the first player who traces his way through the maze from the point of beginning in his Hobbit Shire. Once claimed, the Ring is placed over the successful player's pawn and the chase is on! To win the game, a player must successfully elude the pursuit of his opponents and carry the Ring back to the starting space of his Hobbit Shire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
