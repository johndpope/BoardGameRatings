			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THRILLING TALES: Suddenly...Encounters!, written by Shannon Kalvar, presents a series of short THRILLING TALES encounters that can be dropped into any pulp-genre adventure to spice things up! Each entry contains details of the encounter, a discussion of how characters might interact with it, and an array of elements you can introduce to further complicate the situation.
