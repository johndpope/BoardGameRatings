			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shelter is a hybrid of card-duelling games and the castle defence genre. Can you survive against the zombie hordes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight for your life against wave after wave of zombies. Place, modify and use guns! Reinforce your defences! Fight hand to hand! Shelter combines that strategic gameplay of card-duelling games with a simple dice roll based enemy to create a unique single-player experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the hugely popular Android, iOS and Windows Phone game, Shelter will provide you with hours of exciting play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the developer's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shelter is a single player game where you build a deck of duelling cards and take them into battle against a zombie deck that &amp;ldquo;plays itself&amp;rdquo;. The zombie deck is not controlled by a hideously complex AI, but plays based on a simple set of rules and dice rolls for that element of chance. You must fight off the waves of zombies before they smash your shelter&amp;rsquo;s barricades and start munching on your brains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You choose your survival strategy when you build your deck. Do you pack as many guns into your deck as you can? Do you use traps and reinforce your defences? Do you stun stronger zombies and pick off the weak ones? You have the freedom to play as you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you win duels, you will be rewarded with new cards to work into your deck and streamline your play style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
