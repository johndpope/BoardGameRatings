							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeon Crawler: Unbound Delve Pack 2 â€“ Stonehold</name>
									
			<description>To expand your collection further you can pick up one of the five Delve Packs. These non-random packs contain 52 cards, now printed in the USA, with new Adventurers, Quests and a mix of new cards and useful copies of cards from the Unbound Starter to bolster both your Dungeon and your Crawler decks. There is Keldorna (filled with traps), Stonehold (focusing on Undead and Goblins), Outlands (focusing on terrain), Sylvan Woods (focusing on poison), and Barren Mountains (focusing on Stealth and big monsters). The Delve Packs have been reconstructed as v2.0 to work better with 1 full set games instead of a randomized format intended for up to 4 copies of the game. Check the specific game format rules to see limitations on how many copies of each card you can have in a deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
