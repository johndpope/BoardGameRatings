			<description>User Summary: Free pdf product describing the Dwarves in the World of Aruneus setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the book:&lt;br/&gt;Unwilling or unable to deal with urgent requests from their Human allies, the majority of the Dwarves (those not concerned with outside trade) were taken completely by surprise when wave after wave of undead humans found their way into Dwarven territories. The King, who at the age of 170 was growing feeble, had taken to living well away from the mountains and leaving most administrative tasks to his son and heir, Prince Terriace Camere. Prince Camere was living in the night-blessed palatial residences at the time of the undead outbreak and failed to adequately prepare the underground city to repulse the zombie hordes. According to second hand reports compiled some years later, Ashcamere held out in one form or another for almost a full year after the initial wave of zombies overran the sun-sighted city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
