							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">No Safe Port: WW2 Naval Warfare</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;No Safe Port&amp;quot; is a board game covering Operational and Tactical-level naval combat during the Second World War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;No Safe Port&amp;quot; is designed to cover many of the major navies that fought during WW2 and includes submarines, carriers, aircraft, battleships, battlecruisers, heavy cruisers, light cruisers, destroyers, coastal batteries, land units, and more. User printable data/record sheets show the combat details of each individual class of ship, sub, and aircraft, each with a side view graphic. Solitaire and multiplayer rules are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a significant revision of the original 'NW:WW2' game series, and adds additional details and rules to the system (including floatation loss and individualized weapon data). The Rules are modular, allowing for Basic, Advanced, and Optional/Expanded rules systems that you can choose to use or not as you wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is professionally printed with mounted couters and full color heavy cardstock maps. The 'data cards' from the previous game series has been discarded in favor of user-printable data sheets on a CD-ROM included with the game; each sheet contains combat logs for up to 7 ships/subs or squadrons of aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Countries included: United States, Great Britain, Germany, France, Japan, Italy, Soviet Union, Australia, Denmark, and Netherlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed yet streamlined combat mechanics including basic, advanced, optional, and solitaire rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Data CD-ROM with fully printable data/record sheets covering 230 ship classes (including merchants, raiders, and transports), 100+ aircraft models, 35 submarine classes, 16 types of land units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Each printable Data/Record Sheet contains the combat statistics for the unit, condensed combat tables to help during combat, a side view of the unit, with logs for ammunition/damage records for 7 ships/subs or aircraft squadrons pre-printed on each sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     58 page printed Rules Manual with 24 scenarios, including historical and hypothetical scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     9 Color maps 11&amp;quot; x 17&amp;quot;, a color combat matrix, and 280 die-cut 1/2&amp;quot; color counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Search Matrix, 2 Play Sequence charts and 5 color reference charts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Includes 4 six-sided dice (only standard 6-sided die are used for play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Semi-historical Campaigns covering the Pacific, North Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Arctic theatres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Tactical and Operational battles covering surface combat, seaplane carriers, convoys, submarines, aircraft, amphibious operations, bombardments, etc...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Combat examples are included as well as condensed combat tables on each unit data/record sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The game is inteded to be played either as as a board game or with miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
