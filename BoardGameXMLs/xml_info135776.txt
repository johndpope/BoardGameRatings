			<description>promo text from publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Into The Grey is a story about a future world. Technology has outrun most of the people, and everyone has to take care of themselves. You live from job to job, you meet creatures so upgraded with machinery that they are only vaguely human anymore. You come places you usually wouldn&amp;Otilde;t think of setting foot in. You are forced to defend your life. And yet &amp;amp;mdash this is your world, here you and your skills are still of some value at least. Here, if you are lucky enough, you could make it.&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, you share a drink wih other lost souls, and together you look to the stars. Dream of joining those heading off to the stars one day. That is where the answer lies, they say, if the future still has a future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tracklist:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interface (3:46) Essential In This Day And Age &amp;mdash; powerful, rhythmic, driving&lt;br/&gt;    Mega City (4:16) Our Chance To Survive Is Somewhere In There &amp;mdash; gigantic, mighty, menacing&lt;br/&gt;    Cyber Club (2:36) Shake That...
