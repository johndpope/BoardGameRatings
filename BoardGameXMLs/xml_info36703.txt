							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Privateers</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Card game for 2+ players. Latter half of the Seventeenth Century. Players are European Nations employing Privateers to attack each other&amp;rsquo;s shipping.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In this era, only about 20% of a Nations Fleet would be Crown property, the remainder were privately owned ships, that when they were not augmenting the Battle Line, were permitted to do Commerce raiding on their own.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses to play one of four nations: Spain, England, France, or Holland. The custom card deck includes nine types of cards: Ships, Captains, Crews, Bases, Escorts, Merchants, Treasures, Defenses, and Events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first player to amass 100 gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
