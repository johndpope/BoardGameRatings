			<description>Daze of Our Loans is a game for anyone with a sense of humor.  The players are &amp;quot;lenders&amp;quot; that move around the board making loans and, sometimes, recovering on them.  With luck they may even obtain collateral. When circumstances warrant, loans can be sold or participated out to others.  Meanwhile, the economy may quickly change from normal times to recession or boom, sharply changing your loan portfolio values and affecting your strategy.  Players must also deal with unpredictable court judgments, costly regulatory inquiries, bankruptcies, and documentation errors, among other common celebrations in a lender's day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game lasts for one hour, then all players get 2 more turns.  The player with the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
