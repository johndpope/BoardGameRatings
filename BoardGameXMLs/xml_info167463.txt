			<description>Kuhlorado has two ranchers competing to grab cows, control access to the water troughs, and claim the borders of the available land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on an 8x8 paper grid, with the spaces being marked with numbers, cows and water troughs. The border spaces are darker green. On a turn, the player rolls the two dice, then crosses or circles one or two spaces as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    If she rolls two cows, she marks two cows.&lt;br/&gt;    If she rolls two numbers, she marks one space that shows one of these two numbers.&lt;br/&gt;    If she rolls one cow and one number, she can mark either one cow or one number &amp;mdash; or she can mark both, but only if exactly one space separates these spaces in the grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players alternate turns until all the cow spaces have been marked or only five numbers are unmarked. Players then tally their scores, earning 3 points for each border that contains more of their marks than the opponent's, 2 or 4 points for each trough they control, and 2-20 points for each herd they have, depending on the size of the herd. Whoever has the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
