			<description>Simple war game of maneuver and combat. The flags represent army formations where Infantry and Artillery are assigned in secret to the armies. Terrain, and positioning of attacking and defending units modify the combat results. Dice are rolled to indicate combat results.  The  record pad is where each commander records strength and losses to his units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game maybe be played by 2 or 4 players and rules are included to split the commands and you can see in the pictures where each army's home camps are printed along the map edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are about 6 pages digest size, a more involved game than the typical 60's kids game like 1863 or the MB Civil war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
