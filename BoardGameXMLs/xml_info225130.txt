							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Marby Castle</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marby is a minor port in the Kingdom of Orbaal on H&amp;acirc;rn's northern coast. Situated at the headwaters of Pentiel Bay, Marby sees one of the largest tidal variations in Orbaal. Clanhead Mikkaar Serewyn was educated in Shorkyne and prefers diplomacy and debate to the death and destruction favored by his Ivinian viking peers. His clan, an offshoot of the violent Clan Sherwyn, has been locked in a bloody feud with the older clan for more than 40 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Marby Castle article describes the settlement's history, government, religion, economics, and military forces. Details are given for some of the local craftsmen and other locations in the settlement. Includes a full description and color floor plans for the keep, along with color GM and player maps of the settlement. Also includes 2-page expanded descriptions of the town's glassworker and metalsmith, two interesting individuals who can provide services, and adventure opportunities, for your PCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
