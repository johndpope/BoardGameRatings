							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Depths of the Croaking Grotto (C&amp;C)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The isolated town of Kraden&amp;rsquo;s Hill, located on the edges of the frontier in the shadow of the Great Jungle, requires caravans to regularly arrive with goods and then to depart with local commodities. The caravan route is perilous, however, winding through the dangerous Fell Mountains before coming through to the frontier town beyond. Some caravans are waylaid by orcs or mountain beasts, their wreckage discovered by subsequent merchants. Others are never heard from again. But one such merchant caravan carried something of great value that the owners desperately want recovered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TG0 Depths of the Croaking Grotto is an adventure module for a group of 4 to 6 characters levels 3 to 5. The bulk of the adventure is wilderness-based, so at least a character is recommended with strong survival skillsets. The Fell Mountains hold many dangers especially for those who go poking into its deepest depths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Fantasy Renaissance Adventure Module brought to you by your friends at Cut to the Chase Games!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
