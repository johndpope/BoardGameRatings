							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bright Blade: Trader</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bright Blade-class trader is a two-decker, and measures 43 meters from bow to drive nacelles, 11 meters across the beam and has a capacity of 200,000kg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is armed to defend against pirates, and also has dummy gun emplacements, systems designed to look like guns if the ship is scanned, to further deter attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tarazet Deep Space Navy has bought several ex-traders for use as inexpensive patrol spaceships, but most are operated by independent traders. If you go aboard as a passenger, be warned, the trading captain will take you to many different adventures on the way along the trade route to your final destination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These deckplans include;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Area and system descriptions&lt;br/&gt;     Color deckplans&lt;br/&gt;     Printer-friendly monochrome maps&lt;br/&gt;     Counters to use on the color deckplans&lt;br/&gt;     Background sections on, design and operators &lt;br/&gt;     Spaceship statistics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a quick-start version of the Spaceward Ho! vehicle combat system as an added bonus, and to make it even easier to integrate this spaceship into your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
