			<description>A One-Round Living City Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Descending down into the town You find Sendrin a town of large ancient stone and smaller newer wood buildings. It will not be hard to find the town hall. Rounding the corner towards the hall you are confronted with a huge line of people. The people are standing sitting or sleeping at one side of the street. The line extends up the street, ending at the doors of what appears to be the town hall. Walking up the street you receive cross looks and rude comments. Line cutters and Out-of-towners you are called from some of the hundred or more in line. Before the doors stands a uniformed guard, the letter says to report to the council hall and this is it, might as well get to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
