							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Depths of Courage, Volume 7: The Raid on Gibraltar.</name>
									
			<description>On September 18, the Italian submarine Scir&amp;eacute; released 3 two-man crew S.L.C (siluro lenta corsa) Maiale (Pig) class mini-submarines to attack Allied shipping in what many thought was an impregnable harbor, safe from any enemy attack. The Italian raiders sank three merchant vessels; the cargo ship Durham and two tankers, Denbydale and Fiona. For their daring raid, all 6 of the Italian frogmen, as well as the entire crew of the submarine Scir&amp;eacute; were hailed as heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The active player takes on the role of the commanders of the three or four, Maiale class mini-submarines. You must endeavor to overcome the Allied defenses and night-time visibility to inflict as much damage as possible before being killed, captured or escaping, and then return to the Scir&amp;eacute;. Can you do as well or better?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each copy of Depths of Courage: The Raid on Gibraltar is composed of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     One 11 by 17 inch point-to-point map.&lt;br/&gt;     22 double-sided, un-mounted counters&lt;br/&gt;     2 pages of rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player will also need a standard deck of playing cards and a six-sided die to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
