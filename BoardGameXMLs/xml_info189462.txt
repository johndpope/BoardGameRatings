			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I lied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've done it now. You and your evil compatriots have managed to piss off a secret Black Ops Commando Special Agent. They've armed themselves with an array of deadly weapons, finished their training montage, and smeared camo paint on their considerable muscles. There's no way out, and they are coming for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All you can do is hope you die last.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unbelievable Macho Bullshit is an oppositional roleplaying party game in one page. Each player plays a villain in an evil organization which is being rapidly disassembled by an unstoppable hero in a hail of bullets and one-liners. You're best bet to survive just a little longer is to try and foist the oncoming storm onto one of your compatriots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is swift, silly, and plays faster the more people you have, making it a great warm-up or random game. It's a good way to let off some steam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
