							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Foulspawn</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No mere cultists, the foulspawn are corrupted mortals who have embraced the Far Realm into their very fabric, and who seek to call upon their alien lords to re-create the world as a place dominated by aberrations. Meet 13 new monsters for your campaign, ranging from the Challenge 1/2 Wretch, who teleports in help when they die, to the Challenge 7 Oracle, who forsees a world where aberrations rule - and who has the power to make it happen. In between, you'll find berserkers and grues, seers and skin-takers, surgeons and mockeries, all mad, and all ready to invade your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
