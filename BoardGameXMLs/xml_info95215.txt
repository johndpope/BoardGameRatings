							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Skitchin&#039;</name>
									
			<description>It has a very similar Road Rash playability and shares the same software engine, but the players are put on violent races involving inline skating, instead of motorbikes. The player can grab onto (skitch) cars, bikes and trucks to earn speed advantage over the competitors and he can pick up weapons from armed enemies and from the ground. Cash is earned winning races, doing tricks, defeating enemies and skitching cars, and you can spend it on better inline gear (such as more resistant elbow pads to protect the player from his injuries).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can be put out of the race wearing out his inline skates, accumulating injuries in eventual accidents or being under arrest (in a similar Road Rash fashion, including funny animations according to the case).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon turning on the game, players are warned not to attempt in real life any stunt portrayed in the game (such as skate hitching onto vehicles).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Skitchin'&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
