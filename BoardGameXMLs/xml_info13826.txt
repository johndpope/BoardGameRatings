			<description>OmAlphalet Experience has been translated into a game concept. It allows you to express feelings, thoughts and experiences and helps you to better understand them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using almost 200 question and oracle cards, OmAlphalet offers the opportunity to think about matters that are not often discussed in daily life. You may exchange your thoughts about these matters with the other players. The subjects cover topics about Love, Fear, Friendship, Family, Spirituality and many others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using various symbolic stones, it is possible to ask additional questions and show your fellow players whether you believe an answer to be truthful or whether you can follow someone's train of thought.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;There are no winners or losers in OmAlphalet Experience. The point is to get to know yourself and others better and better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
