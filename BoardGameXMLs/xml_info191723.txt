			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Times are tough. Finding jobs ain't as easy as it once was. For each job there'll be a hundred or more folk applying for it. It's a bloody joke. What are you going to do?&lt;br/&gt;You're going to brass ball it. You may not know anything about the advertised position, but you learn real fast, and how hard can it really be?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this role-playing poem for 2-5 players, one player will play the role of a jobseeker interviewing for a position; the other players will play the roles of the folk interviewing that person for the position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
