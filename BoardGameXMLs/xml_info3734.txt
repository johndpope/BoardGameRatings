			<description>Based on the cartoon series of the same name, Biker Mice From Mars: Take Back the City is a board game in which players take on the roles of the biker mice heroes.  The city has been overrun by criminals and the heroes are duty-bound to clear it up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take turns to play.  They use a spinner to determine the number of spaces they can move on the board.  Interspersed on the board are locations where the criminals have been randomly placed face-down (except for the boss, Lawrence Limburger, who is placed openly in his headquarters) and where they can draw Plutarkian Pothole cards, which grant positive or negative effects.  By moving their tokens onto criminals, the player engages them in battle, which is resolved by again using the spinner.  If victorious, the player takes (captures) the criminal's disc into his or her possession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all criminals have been captured.  The players score the criminals they have captured (different points for the 6 types of criminals in the game).  The one with the highest points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
