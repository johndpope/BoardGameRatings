							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Necklace (StarCluster 3)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Necklace is the thickest part of a gas torus around a neutron star, itself a part of a close binary with a hot F-type star. The gas torus was formed when another gas giant orbiting the neutron star was slowly stripped of its enormous atmosphere. The gasses stayed in a ring, slowly orbiting the neutron star. The torus changed as life spread into it. Life begets oxygen, and oxygen begets life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Necklace is the inner, denser part of the gas torus, which is breathable for normal humans and earth animals. There is no hard and fast boundary - the air just gradually gets thinner and thinner. This area is about 20 thousand kilometers in diameter. The entire torus has a thickness diameter of about 2 million kilometers, and an overall diameter of 9 million kilometers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is room for a lot of adventures among tree-covered asteroids, and along an artificial River a billion kilometers in diameter, with half sunk asteroids in the river as islands, and all teeming with life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
