			<description>A 1920s campaign for Call of Cthulhu. This is a reprint of the classic Fungi from Yuggoth campaign, with three additional chapters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The year is 1927. For America it is a time of growth and prosperity. Lon Chaney, Babe Ruth, and Charlie Chan are celebrities, while the average young American enjoys speakeasies, jazz, and the new 'talkies'. All that is about to change. A young psychic by the name of Paul LeMond has seen the future, and it is a sight which has driven him insane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Day of the Beast is an episodic campaign taking investigators from the height of 1927 to the edge of the Great Depression in 1929. A global conspiracy has surfaced, and only the investigators can stop it. Travel to the four continents and the planet of Celaeno is required. Can the plans of the Brotherhood of the Beast be stopped before The Stars Are Right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Day of the Beast was originally published as The Fungi from Yuggoth, and in that form also appeared as part of Curse of Cthulhu. Day of the Beast is a new edition of a classic campaign, thoroughly revised. It contains almost 50 pages of new material, including three totally new adventures.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
