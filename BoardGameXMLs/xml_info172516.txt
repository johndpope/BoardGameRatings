			<description>This is a Disney related game and the name means 'Duck Tales'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shuffled deck is placed face down. The first player draws a card. If it is a 1, he plays it front of himself. If it is not a 1, it starts a personal discard pile for that player. Play continues in this vein but once owned discard stacks start to appear then a player may add his drawn card to any stack of the other players or himself as long as the number on the played card is consecutive with the top card on any player's stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the last card has been taken from the central pile, the game continues and the first player to get rid of his discard pile, wins that game. He scores nil and the other players score 1 for each card in their hand. After a pre-arranged number of games, the player with the lowest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
