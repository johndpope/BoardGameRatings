							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Iron Man 2: Game of War</name>
									
			<description>from Hasbro&lt;br/&gt;This card game recreates the battle between Iron Man and War machine from the movie Iron Man 2. Over a number of rounds, the players will engage in a series of three battles, with victory points going to the winner of a majority of the battles. The first player to score 5 victory points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game re-implements Craig van Ness' earlier design, Clash of the Light Sabers, which has been remade 2 times before. This version is a mixture of the previous Iron Man battling card game (from the first film) and the original edition. The extra cards from the Iron Man battling game have been included, but other cards (1 each of value 1, 2, and 3) have been removed from each deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's Description:&lt;br/&gt;Choose a suit and prepare for action! Jump into a head-to-head battle of points and power and side with the heroic IRON MAN or his fearless combatant, WAR MACHINE. Take no prisoners in this fast-paced, action-packed card duel and keep score with the IRON MAN and WAR MACHINE game pieces. Be clever and use your cards wisely to out-play and outlast your opponent!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes 2 game pieces, 55 Iron Man battle cards, 55 War Machine battle cards, 5 Iron Man victory cards, 5 War Machine victory cards and instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 2 or more players. Ages 6 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
