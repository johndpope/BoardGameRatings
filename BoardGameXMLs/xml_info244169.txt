			<description>Three experienced criminals stole relics of divine essence at the N&amp;uuml;wa Temple. This theft, simply committed by greed, threatens to plunge the city into an era of plagues and cataclysms. Of course, you are not irreproachable on this ground .. As a bounty hunter, each contract is valid if it is lucrative. Also, do you agree to hunt down these looters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Immerse yourself in a medieval Asian universe and play the heroine to find the three criminals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tears of a Goddess, a.k.a. Nuwa's Tears, is a comic combined with a game, one title in a series subtitled &amp;quot;The comic in which you are the hero&amp;quot;. You embody a character in a immersive story in which your choices guide your progress. You have a character sheet akin to those used in role-playing games that tracks your possessions, your special abilities, your coins, and your victory points. In general, gameplay consists in following the comic's panels &amp;mdash; which contain clues, riddles and traps &amp;mdash; and making choices about where to go and what to do, while using your visual perception to collect clues and be smart enough to resolve the riddles. As in any game, you can lose &amp;mdash; sometimes really badly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
