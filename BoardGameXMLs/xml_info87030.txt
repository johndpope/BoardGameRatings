			<description>User Summary: Game Chef 2010 Design Competition Submission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Starting the game. If you have a group of 4 or more players (3 will do in a pinch, and more than 6-7 may feel unsatisfying), a copy of these rules, the various Question Cards, and a couple of hours of free time, great, you have everything you need to play this game. If you have the role requirements printed out and spread between the players as play aids, even better. Additionally a positive attitude and enthusiasm will help the game immensely!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;World Riddle should be a koan - the answer to the question is neither important nor fixed, nor does it need to make any sense. The important part of the game is how the players reach the answer and what it reveals to them about the characters they create and about themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
