							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Pretenders</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a new recruit of the Super Hero Guild, an organization of beings with special powers dedicated to protecting all of humanity from Super Villains. On your first day, you have been assigned to patrol a distant cave alongside other new recruits - It was supposed to be an easy mission. Alas , the moment your patrol enters the cave, the very entrance collapses in on itself, trapping everyone within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suddenly, you hear someone cry out and everyone turns to look at a dead recruit. The enemy has infiltrated your ranks! Before he kills the entire patrol, you must somehow stop him. To make matters worse, you do not know what powers these other new faces possess. Attacking someone without fully understanding their powers could very well get you killed instead. Time is also running out for everyone. If the standoff lasts too long, food and air will be depleted and that's certainly not a good thing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to The Pretenders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highlights&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) The game does not require a narrator (everyone plays!) nor does it run on a digital 'app' and no, it doesn't play for 1 game day only. It is a complete game that plays out across many days!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Players CAN defend themselves (phew for all the alpha/strong players who always get killed on the first 'voting' simply because they play the game well and other players fear them) Instead, there is a limited amount of 'defending cards' players can utilize to protect themselves. Gone are the days of helplessly getting killed without reason.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Something else is also gone in this game, and we sure don't miss it. The days when you only have ONE single ability and you can only do that same thing again and again. In this game, you are powerful beings who have an entire arsenal of powers at your disposal. Imagine that - a whole range of powers that you can use!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) There is another result besides the good guys winning or the bad guys winning - it is entirely possible that EVERYONE LOSES! You are all stuck in a cave, with lack of food and air. If it plays out too long, everyone dies!! (except the robot dude who doesn't breathe)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5) Even after elimination, players play as Rescue Crew from outside of the cave and can still influence the outcome for their 'team' by deciding what items to throw into the cave as the days go by.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
