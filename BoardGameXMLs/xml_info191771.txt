			<description>Take to the sky commanding squadrons of bi-planes in this exciting head-to-head dice game! Sharpen your aim as your competitors dodge your attack. Call up your flying Aces to take down your opponent&amp;rsquo;s planes and claim your victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Squadron Dice is a game of elimination. First, players roll a set  of dice to gain position over other players. Next, the highest and lowest positioned players roll dice again, forcing the lowest positioned player to remove one of their Squadron dice from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player is eliminated from the game when a player cannot replace a Rookie die with an Aces die after a loss on an Evade roll during a Resolve Phase. When all other players have been eliminated from the game, you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
