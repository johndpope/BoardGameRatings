			<description>Those crazy Clowns have taken over the circus cannons again. They've created a wall of colorful blocks and are taking turns blasting it with cannonballs. Blocks and cannonballs are flying everywhere. Each Clown has a favorite color and he's trying to keep the other Clowns from blasting the blocks of that secret color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Loose Cannons players are clowns that take turns playing range cards, that represent cannon fire, at a wall of colorful blocks. Each clown is attempting to remove the other clown's secret colors and protect their own color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first phase of the game involves the building of the wall. After players have discovered their secret color and a secret numbered block they take turns pulling blocks from a bag and placing them in the wall. &lt;br/&gt;When the wall is complete, players take turns playing cards from their hand to knock blocks out of the wall. The deck includes a lot of special cards to make cannonballs miss-fire, go long, fall short or even knock 2 blocks off in one shot.&lt;br/&gt;There are a limited number of cannonballs per player, which varies based on the number of players, so when the first player shoots his last cannonball, the round is completed and scores are tallied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
