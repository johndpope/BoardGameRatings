			<description>Word of Horus&amp;rsquo; treachery escapes Isstvan III and now the Legions loyal to the Emperor mobilise to make Horus and those who follow account for their crimes. However the depth of the betrayal is yet to be revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Horus Heresy Book Two: Massacre is lavishly illustrated in full colour and contains the dark deeds leading up to the terrible slaughter that unfolded during the Isstvan V Dropsite Massacre. Also detailed are the histories of the four legions that took part: The Iron Hands, Salamanders, Night Lords and Word Bearers, and an extensive campaign system so you can play out the battles on the tabletop. This book also contains additional entries for the Space Marine Legion Crusade Army list presented in The Horus Heresy Book One: Betrayal, as well as games rules for the Primarchs of the four newly described Legions, super-heavy vehicles and special characters featured in the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book itself is a full colour 286 page hardback, leather bound with embossed and silvered text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
