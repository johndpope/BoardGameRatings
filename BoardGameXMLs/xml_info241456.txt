			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a level 3 party!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nightly howling from the woods has the townsfolk on edge. Even worse, the town's courier refuses to leave, fearing for his life. High Scrivener Dow doesn't need some mongrels stymieing business for him, so it's up to the party to root out whatever beasts are causing the disturbance each night. Their investigation leads them to the ruined site of a castle that once stood in the woods centuries ago. Something caused it to mysteriously sink in the earth, leaving a shattered surface in its wake, and the castle's name and purpose have been lost to obscurity since.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's more, on this particular night, the howling has been replaced by an enchanting and eerie melody without source. Will the characters turn tail and run when they learn the truth behind the nightly disturbances? Or, will they press onward to face the music?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
