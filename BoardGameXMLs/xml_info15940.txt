			<description>Snob - A fantasy shopping spree&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Snob is a roll-and-move game in the style of Monopoly.  The goal of Snob is to be the first player to spend and/or accumulate 10 million dollars (or other arbitrary dollar figure).  Players move around the board and collect &amp;quot;Customer Service&amp;quot; cards that add or detract from their dollar total -- if the amount on the Customer Service cards exceeds the amount on the space where the player has landed, they can gamble and re-roll to see if they can spend more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the regular spaces, there are Gold spaces which correspond to luxury items the players can buy in the &amp;quot;auction&amp;quot; (e.g. Oil Wells, Yacht, Furs, etc.) The player who landed on the space reads the description of the item and players make bids and attempt to be closest to the value of the described item without overbidding.  The player who was closest adds the item to their stockpile of goods.  Additionally, there is a &amp;quot;Swiss Bank Account&amp;quot; space that rewards the player whose account number is drawn from the account deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Without any background information, Snob appears to be a small-print game or game prototype with high production values.  The components include the game board, two nice plastic card trays with 8 varieties of cards, Snob emblazoned notepads for each player, and glass &amp;quot;jewels&amp;quot; that serve as player pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
