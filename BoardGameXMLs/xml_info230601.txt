			<description>A card game for 2-4+ players in which players try to increase their net worth and earning potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share 2 common decks. Players begin with the starting deck and then move onto the expert deck. There are 9 Card types: Acumen, Real Estate, Business Investment, Debt Management, Personal Expenses, Business Expenses, Stock Portfolio, Collectible Items and Windfall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts the game with: &lt;br/&gt;Job Income: 8K per month &lt;br/&gt;Total Expenses: 6K per month &lt;br/&gt;Savings: 15K &lt;br/&gt;Stock Market Portfolio: 15K&lt;br/&gt;Assets: Home = 300K and Cars = 30K&lt;br/&gt;Retirement Funds = 200K&lt;br/&gt;Liabilities: Mortgage = 250K and Cars = 20K&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns (representing 1 month) with each turn comprising 5 phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.    Payday&lt;br/&gt;-     Earn money from all of your income streams including job, businesses, and rentals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.    Expenses&lt;br/&gt;-     Pay for all your expenses. This includes mortgage payments, car payments, living expenses, loan payments, and real estate overhead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.   Opportunity&lt;br/&gt;-    Draw 1 card from the current deck. The card drawn will present either an opportunity you may take, or an extra expense you must take depending on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.   Market&lt;br/&gt;-    This phase represents volatility in the markets. Players roll on the asset adjustment table once for each of their assets to see if value or income is affected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5.   End &lt;br/&gt;-    Discard all cards. Calculate your Net Worth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when players have gone through both decks. The player with the highest net worth is the winner. If tied, the player with the highest monthly income is the winner. If still tied, the player with the most liquid cash wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
