			<description>Tiny Zombies is a cooperative zombie survival game for 1-6 players. You have to work together to find your way to a safe zone within the city. Along the way you'll encounter obstacles, items, and (of course) hordes of zombies! Each player chooses one of the survivors as his character, and each character is unique and has a different play style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the items you find, you'll fight your way through the waves of undead monsters, and when there are just too many to shoot, stab or bludgeon to death, you'll have to run! For those players who are killed by the zombie hordes, don't fret. You'll become a zombie yourself and spend the rest of the game hunting down your former survivor friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiny Zombies is designed for players age 10+ and has a light-hearted cartoon style to all the artwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
