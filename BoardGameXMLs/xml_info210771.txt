							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">In The Hole</name>
									
			<description>The game consists of four plastic coated two sided course maps on which there is a table to record the results, 4 pens for this purpose and a special board in which are set ten spinners. Each spinner is marked for the purpose it is to be used e.g. &amp;quot;Tee Shot&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Putting&amp;quot;,  &amp;quot;Greenside Bunker&amp;quot; etc. and each is at the centre of a number of possible results.&lt;br/&gt; Starting with the appropriate Tee Shot spinner, one spins it, notes the result, which tells one where one has got to and what situation one is in, thus defining which spinner is to be used next. This continues until one finishes the hole when the result is recorded and so one, hole after hole.&lt;br/&gt; The winner is as in golf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
