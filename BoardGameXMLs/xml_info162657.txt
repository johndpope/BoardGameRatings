			<description>SANTA purSUIT is a family-friendly race game using only cards. Each player is trying to race their character around the table, through other players hands, and complete the necessary laps to be the Santa Suit Marathon winner! Something fun to play with family and friends during the holidays. Perfect stocking stuffer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in 3 phases, each turn:&lt;br/&gt;1) Pass (simultaneously all players pass cards from their hand to the player to their left, aka. clockwise. Players must pass the number of cards required to get their hand down to 5. If players have less than 7 cards, they must pass at least 1 card, unless they have 0 cards, then they don't need to pass a card).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Pick (each player, in turn order, select cards in their opponents hands to press their luck, and advance their own runner. Each card has one of three symbols that either advance, stop, or backup your racer.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Play (after all players have picked cards, then players may play sets as a bonus sprint action for your racer)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player has successfully completed the necessary laps in the marathon, they are the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During setup, players can set the number of laps required for each racer to either balance difficulty level for different aged players and/or adjust the total game length.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
