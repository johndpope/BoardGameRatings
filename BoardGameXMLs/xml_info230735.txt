			<description>In this children's game, themed after Walt Disney's Cinderella animated picture, players move along a path of coloured spaces by drawing cards with instructions to move ahead a number of spaces, to move ahead or back to a space of a certain colour, or to switch places with another player. When a player reaches the end of the track, they must select the correct shoe card from a spread of five to win, or be sent back to the pumpkin space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Likely released in the late 70s or very early 80s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
