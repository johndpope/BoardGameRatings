							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spartacus</name>
									
			<description>Spartacus is a wargame for 1 or 2 players simulating the Servile War of 73-71 BC. One of the players leads the forces of the escaped gladiator Spartacus, the other controls the Roman forces. The game also includes rules for solitaire play (in which case the game system controls the Roman side).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a point-to-point map of Italy. Each point of the map has a set of numbers describing how many troops Spartacus can recruit there, how many equipment points are available (for arming and training recruits), how much food is available and if a granary is present in the region. Each game turn consists of moving Spartacus' army, collecting recruits, arming and training slaves, and checking whether or not there are enough supplies available in the occupied regions (if not, casualties occur and one or more regions is devastated). The Roman player then take her turn, moving legions and checking for reinforcements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is resolved by a diceless Combat Result Table which take into account the training level and quality of the troops, the terrain and the strategic value of the leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spartacus wins by either successfully besieging Rome, flee through the Alps or escape by the sea. The Roman player wins by preventing a Slave victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
