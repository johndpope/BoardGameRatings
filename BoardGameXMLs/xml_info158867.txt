			<description>&amp;quot;Fortune. The Game of Trading and Speculation&amp;quot; is Pre-Monopoly game, which was published by Parker Brothers. Only 5000 of these games were created.&lt;br/&gt;Parker Brothers wasn't about to put all its eggs in one basket though. They had Darrow file for a patent, but knowing the true history of Monopoly they decided to produce their own version of the game. Fortune was the result of this work. As few as 5,000 of these games were made in 1935 before patent 2,026,082 was granted giving Parker Brothers proprietary rights to Monopoly. The name Fortune was then added to Finance which became Finance and Fortune until Parker Brothers used the name Fortune for another game in 1958.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main differences from Monopoly are: game board design, hotel color, and that the Property cards seem to be based on the streets of New York City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
