							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sacrifice of the Pharaohs</name>
									
			<description>In the land and time of ancient Egypt Pharaohs ruled the land. Amongst the Pharaoh's court were jesters, foreign dignitarys, concubines, advisors, scientists, family members, and of course- the queen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The old saying goes that every Pharaoh is only as good as the company he surrounds himself with. Well, in this case, the Pharaoh is dumb. Really dumb. But he still holds all of the power to the kingdom. He has the power to sacrifice those that are disloyal to him, and bury the best servants with him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bottom line... be as mediocre as possible, and the Pharaoh won't off you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes on a role (each with its own special abilities) for the duration of game play. Every turn, a player chooses to either increase his PR (Pharaoh Report... Pharaoh Faction) or to decrease it. This is done by decided whether to flip a Naughty or Nice card. Of course, each card has its own twist. Sometimes, a player may overshoot his goals and go from the most liked, to the least. In addition, players have gold that can be used to pay off the executioner from getting them this round, but that is only a stay of death. And the gold can be used to buy special cards. And special cards.. have almost all disastrous events for the entire court...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For... in the land of the Pharaoh... anything goes. Well, almost anything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
