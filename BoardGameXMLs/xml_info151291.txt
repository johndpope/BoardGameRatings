			<description>Collision is a super-hero deck building game, created by Magenic Technologies. In Collision, players play as software superheroes (The Automator, The Architect, The Oracle, Big Data, and The Mechanic) to build a deck utilizing additional heroes, super-powers, gear, and additional equipment to fight villains big and small, from small bugs all the way up to the evil Retrograde and Rain Cloud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, the active player plays cards from their hands. Most cards in the game yield from 1 to 5 power, which is the main currency of the game. Other cards allow manipulation of the player's discard pile, drawing additional cards, ridding the deck of unwanted cards or additional bonuses. Having accumulated power during their turn, players finally use their power to purchase additional cards to increase their deck's strength. Each card purchased is worth victory points, and the person who has the most victory points at the end of the game is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
