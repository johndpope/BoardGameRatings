							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Covenant Purifier</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Covenant Purifier is a zealot dedicated to serving the Sanguine Covenant in the task of making the world a freer, safer place. He does this by carrying out purifications &amp;ndash; missions to kill (or rarely just capture) heretics and infidels. While the Covenant has many knights and warriors to serve in open battle, the Purifier is a silent warrior who reaches foes that can only be struck through stealth and shadow. Purifiers have formal garb when taking rest in a Covenant temple, but conceal their identity much of their other time. A secret identity may be taken as a soldier, minor priest, merchant, or even criminal or prostitute. No deception is considered too base or embarrassing to a Purifier &amp;ndash; their pride comes only in service, and their glory will come only in the afterlife. This attitude bring much scorn from those outside the Sanguine Covenant, and even some within it, but it also means people of the world know anyone, from traveling merchants to local fishmongers or their own mistresses, could be a Purifier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement has includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     All the information to play a Covenant Purifier prestige class in your NeoExodus or other home setting.&lt;br/&gt;     All New Covenant Purifier Feats including Damage Finesse and Full Thrust.&lt;br/&gt;     Plus Covenant Purifier counters for miniature games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
