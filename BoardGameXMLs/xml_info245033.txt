			<description>Fishing game where players attempt to catch the most bass as measured in total weight.  Players move from area to areas on the board and cast lines in an attempt to reel in a fish.  Dice rolls determine whether you caught anything (with some areas providing a higher probability of success) and the size of the bass that was caught.  There are penalties for catching undersized fish or returning to the marina too late at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the front of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by fishermen for fishermen... Ages 8 to 80. Three levels of play: BASIC * INTERMEDIATE * ADVANCED teach scientific fishing by simulating actual fishing experiences. YOUR fishing knowledge and skill determine YOUR catch. Perfect for family, club, or solitary play. 1-8 PLAYERS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
