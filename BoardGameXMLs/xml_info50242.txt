							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Reconciliation Game</name>
									
			<description>An educational game in religion for school or home, The Reconciliation Game is a game with a subtitle: The Sacraments Are For Us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I this way, the purpose of the game is to help children express their ideas on how the sacraments reconcile christians to God and to one another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play involves spinning two wheels entitled, &amp;quot;Spin Me First&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Spin Me Next&amp;quot;.  The former identifies which particular sacrament a player or team will comment, and one particular aspect therein.  The latter indicates a particular person or group which this sacrament affects directly or indirectly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players or teams have three types of input to utilize in synthesizing a brief commentary: the name of the sacrament; a statement about it; and a person or group which is related to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next, a resource person (an adult or peer) evaluates the player's answer, discusses it, and/or amplifies it, after which they give a score of one to five points to the person or team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played to a particular point total, or with a time limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
