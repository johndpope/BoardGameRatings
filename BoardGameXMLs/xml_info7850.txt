							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shootout Pro Soccer</name>
									
			<description>Shootout Pro Soccer allows the table-top gamer the opportunity to coach their favorite North American Soccer League(NASL) stars in soccer action. All 24 NASL teams are represented with player ratings based on 1979 statistics. Players are rated on their shooting and ball control ability, as well as the likelihood that they would register an assist. Goalkeepers are each individually rated as well. Each team is also rated for its overall defensive ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coaches (gamers) set lineups, and make basic strategic and tactical decisions. The game plays very quickly making it perfect for replays of entire seasons. While the game can be quite enjoyable played against an opponent, it is perfect for solitaire play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
