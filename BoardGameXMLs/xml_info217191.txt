			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Buried Zikurat &amp;ndash; An adventure for 3 to 7 characters level 6th through 8th and designed for use with most versions of the best-known fantasy roleplaying game. Optimized for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and for 5 level 7 characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building upon the success of the Lost Temple of Forgotten Evil, Kevin Watson from Dark Naga Adventures brings you part 2 of the series! This can be played as part of the series or as a stand-alone adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The clay mining operation at Caford has discovered a large step pyramid, or zikurat. This imposing structure was buried completely in the clay sheet they have been mining for decades to make brick and other ceramic products. The local miners see what they think is an obvious entrance, but cannot get past the slab of stone. A call for aid is sent to the capital city of Meawold, and the party is sent to investigate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Could this be one of the Nexuses that traded goods from the subterranean Land of Night to the surface world?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Places where treasures of the subterranean kingdoms, like mithril weapons, were traded for surface goods. Bastions of trade that were lost during the fall of the First Age of Man. Why has it been dormant for almost two millennia? What lies within? Is it a threat to Caford, or the Kingdom of Meawold as a whole? If they can get inside, the party will have to navigate millennia-old magic locks and security sentinels to find answers to these questions and more within The Buried Zikurat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring clever tricks and traps, and exciting new magic, all wrapped up in an elven mystery of the ages. The Buried Zikurat is sure to bring hours of enjoyment to your gaming table!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
