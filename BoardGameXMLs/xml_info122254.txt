			<description>Four angry, hungry worms battle it out for food. They want to grow longer and heavier. And they have it in for their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, players will want to make their worm grow. At the same time, a vital part of battle is to protect the weaker parts of the worms' bodies (mainly the head) by utilizing the cover available in the playing area. They will also try to weaken the enemy worms either through battle or by eating their food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But all this can't be done at the same time. For instance, you can't eat and fight. Good worms never shoot with their mouths full. So certain decisions must be made. Should they engage in battle or fulfill their hunger? Should they eat food of their own color or that of their enemies? Will they use the food they ate to grow longer or to gain in bulk? Or maybe they should grab that token which will allow them to draw some cards. And what if that bomb detonates when they get close to it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the size of their worm, each player has a certain number of dice available to them.  These can be used to pay for the cost of Action cards he wishes to play, to move his worm, to defend his worm, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a hand limit of 8 cards. There are two types of card. Action cards allow the player to take certain good or bad actions. Dice cards are used as dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To cut a long story short....... is reminiscent of an arcade game from a decade or two ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
