			<description>This is an alternate version of memory. The active player is given one of 100 cards with a person on it and allowed to look at it for 10 seconds. After that, the card is put away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another player then reads one of the questions for that card from a booklet, and the player needs to answer correctly to score a point. After that, the player can choose to answer another question (at most three) about the same card. However, each new question is more difficult, and failure to answer a question means the player doesn't get any points that turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
