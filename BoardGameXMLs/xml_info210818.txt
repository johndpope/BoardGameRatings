							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Plot Thickens: Romance Edition</name>
									
			<description>The Plot Thickens is a storytelling game for quick-thinking, imaginative folks just like you and your friends. The object is to take your hand of story cards, (people, places and things) and lay out the tale of your character, and their fate! You&amp;rsquo;ll earn plot points for every card you use to build your story, and every time you interweave with other&amp;rsquo;s narratives.&lt;br/&gt; The storyteller with the most points gets to craft the ending as main character, while the person who connected the most to their cards gets to name the epic as the Author. What will your story be?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Romance Edition throws you into your favorite paper back romance novel with muscle bound heroes, Manic Pixie Dream girls and a hooker with a heart of gold!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
