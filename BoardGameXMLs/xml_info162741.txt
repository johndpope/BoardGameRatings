							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alhambra: Medina Buildings</name>
									
			<description>A new mini-expansion that is part of the Everything Alhambra Kickstarter Campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 9 tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup: All nine tiles are added to the bag, along with the rest of the building tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules: At the end of each round, the Medina tiles are scored after all other buildings have been scored. Negative points are awarded to the player or players who have the fewest Medinas built.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first round, it is the player with the fewest (-3 pts)&lt;br/&gt;Second round, the two players with the fewest (-3 pts, -6 pts)&lt;br/&gt;Third round, the three players with the fewest (-3 pts, -6pts, -9 pts)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ties are resolved by the Medina who has the higher purchase prize winning the tie, thus the player with the cheaper Medina gains the higher minus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In all scoring rounds, every player who has not built any Medina tiles receives additional minus points equal to the round you are scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
