			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Statecraft is a Grand Strategy Roleplaying Game designed to simulate  international relations during the early modern period, roughly 1500 to 1900  A.D. The game can also be used to simulate earlier periods of history if you  wish, although some of the game concepts (like Casus Belli) may not be  entirely appropriate for the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Statecraft, the players take on the mantle of a ruler from history, called a  Sovereign. The Sovereign is represented using a character design similar to  those in traditional roleplaying games. Sovereigns will be good at some things  and bad at others, just like rulers in real history. The character design is set up  in a way that encourages real life behavior, including recklessness and short- sightedness, to create an experience akin to actually commanding nations  from history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;            &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Statecraft is about having fun, not accumulating wealth and power. The  game is designed so that it is often not in your best interest to take the  most conservative and safe path. Your reward for taking risks and being  ostentatious is Prestige. This is your barometer of success in the game. If  you are accumulating large amounts of Prestige, you have probably been  contributing to the fun of everyone in the group. There are also opportunities  to spend Prestige to accomplish even more amazing things in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment:&lt;br/&gt;Statecraft is designed with play by forum or play by email gaming in mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
