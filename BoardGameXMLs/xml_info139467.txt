							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Contenders (Ronnies 2 submission)</name>
									
			<description>Designer's description:&lt;br/&gt;A role-playing game of blood and sweat pain and hope. Contenders is a rpg dealing with the shady and painful world of boxing. Each player takes on the role of a contender, a pugilist trying to overcome his pain and fight his way out of the gutter. This is a submission for the ronnies 2, taking inspiration from Pain and Fight.&lt;br/&gt;(from post on 1km1kt)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;This is the original version of the game as published on the 1km1kt website as an entry for the Ronnies 2 contest.  It is available from both 1km1kt and as a demo from the publisher of the, more developed, commercially published version of the game.  The content of the demo download and the 1km1kt files are the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
