			<description>From the Chaosium website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strange Songs can be heard across time and space...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new monograph from the acclaimed* non-euclidian fuzion band Cabal 13. Strange Songs includes 5 modern day Call of Cthulhu adventures with a musical theme:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daddy's Little Girl&lt;br/&gt;Drum Circle&lt;br/&gt;Make Ye A Path&lt;br/&gt;Opening Act&lt;br/&gt;Two Turntables &amp;amp; A Microphone&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's something here for just about everyone. Inner City Hip Hop. Shamanic Drumming. R'lyeh Rock &amp;amp; Roll. Gospel. Classical Cultist. Play them as one shots. Play them as stand alone adventures in your on going campaign. However you play them, play them loud!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be sure to catch Cabal 13 on tour at a cemetery near you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Cabal 13 is widely acclaimed on mars. Go ask them. Strange Songs is not a Blood Brothers collection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each adventure does take itself more seriously than the sales monkey who wrote the copy may be letting on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
