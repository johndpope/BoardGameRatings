			<description>Snare is played on a grid resembling a checkerboard. Half of the squares are shaded and contain a circle, the others are blank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players alternate turns. Each turn, a player marks an X in any unshaded square on the board. When a move is made which completely surrounds one or more of the shaded squares, the player making the move marks all of the circles as belonging to him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players continue to alternate moves until all shaded squares have been captured. The player capturing the most shaded squares is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the 3M Paper Games Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
