			<description>The Game Wave Family Entertainment System is a hybrid DVD player and video game console. It was first released in Canada in October 2005. It is part of the seventh generation of gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the main consoles (such as the PS3), the Game Wave is aimed at a more family friendly market: a majority of its games are trivia based or video versions of more traditional games (such as variants of Scrabble and Blackjack). The Game Wave can connect up to 6 controllers (which look like TV remotes) but comes with 4. Each controller has a different color (yellow, red, blue, green, purple, and orange) to help players tell them apart. It comes with a case that can hold all 6 remotes and a copy of 4 Degrees: The Arc of Trivia, Vol. 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Game Wave Family Entertainment System&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
