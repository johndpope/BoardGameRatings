			<description>A Christmas-themed racing game for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four (yes, four!) wooden Magi are placed on a table or on the floor, about a meter from the pieces representing Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus. At the start of the game, each player is secretly assigned a color, and to win he/she has to be the first to move the wise man of the corresponding colour to the Holy Family. Movement is decided by rolling a die and moving a king the length of a wooden camel piece. Players can move their own wise man as well as those of other players. Give your colour away too soon and you risk that the other players move you back!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
