							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eight Is Great</name>
									
			<description>From the box: First player to lose all their cards wins!  Fun for up to 8 players, ages 6 and up.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A card game that is basically Uno with a light LDS theme and without most of the special cards.  There are ten characters in four different colors as well as &amp;quot;Eight Is Great&amp;quot; cards as wilds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt five cards to start the game.  A card from the deck is flipped face-up to start the discard pile.  Players can play a card from their hand of either the same color or of the same character as the face-up card in the discard.  If they cannot match a card or play an eight is Great card as a wild to change the color, they draw one card from the draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until one player plays their last card and wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
