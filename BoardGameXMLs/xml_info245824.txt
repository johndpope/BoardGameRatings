							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cat Rescue</name>
									
			<description>Cat Rescue is a 1 to 4 player cooperative card game. During the game, players take a turn to take a cat from the street or rescue home and slide it into the cat shelter. When there are three or four cats of the same color in a row or column, cats in the middle are flipped over and now ready for adoption. When the flipped over cats are pushed out of the shelter, they are adopted to their new loving home. Game ends when the deck is depleted or a rescue home has three cats. Players together receive a Cat Rescue title based on the number of cats that are flipped and adopted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
