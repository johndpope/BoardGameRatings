			<description>The game is a mostly abstract strategy game with a space theme.  The board represents the solar system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player draws a hand composed of three different planets in the solar system.  On their turn, each player then roll dice and move the planets around the sun in an attempt to get the planets into an alignment.  Once an alignment has been achieved, the player scores a point, draws three new planets, and attempts to make a new alignment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to score three points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
