							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wo ist Jack the Ripper</name>
									
			<description>The city is appalled by the serial murders occurring in the red light district. The police at Scotland Yard desperately seek the murderer. A small band of reporters is likewise on the hunt, not for the murderer, but for the best story for their next edition. But it's not just the story that matters, it's getting it to print as fast as possible as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In game terms, players meld 3 types of cards trying to match the requirements of the current story. The first to do so claims the story and the points. Then it's on to the next story. Each player must play or take an Action card each turn which throws a monkey wrench into the best laid plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Premiered Essen 2003.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
