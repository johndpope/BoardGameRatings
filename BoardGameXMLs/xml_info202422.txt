			<description>Cycling board game published in Germany (in 1926), it's about indoor cycling and takes place on an oval track, those races are know as 6-tage rennen since they last 6 days.&lt;br/&gt;It has a roll &amp;amp; move mechanic but overtaking is only possible in straights (which have black dots) with a higher number, the overtaken rider moves to the neighboring white dot, misses a turn, and resumes the race from the black dot.&lt;br/&gt;You must reach exactly the last black point before each curve and overtaking in the curves is not allowed. The rider behind will stay behind losing any extra pips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
