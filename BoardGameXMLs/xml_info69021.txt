			<description>&amp;quot;Kung Fu Panda is a game intended mainly for children based on the movie Kung Fu Panda. Players initially control Po, learning various fighting techniques and special moves, although in some parts of the game the player will have to complete the tasks as another character. After collecting a number of coins at the end of each level, the player has the option to buy upgrades to Po's moves and health, as well as a different set of clothes. Eventually, as the player progresses through the game, s/he will be able to unlock other characters including Master Shifu and the members of the Furious Five, a team of elite fighters each with their own fighting styles and minigames. In addition, the player will be able to use objects and weapons when fighting. Furthermore, before each new level, Po narrates the continuing story, while the words are being scrolled up on the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Kung_Fu_Panda_(video_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
