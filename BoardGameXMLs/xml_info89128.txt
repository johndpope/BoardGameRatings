			<description>French self-produced cycling game that features a couple of two-faced boards whith which you can make four different tracks, four teams of four riders (some of them hand painted, though monochrome), an extra yellow jersey rider (to replace the leader in stage races), a set of tactic/chance cards, a couple of dice, some markers, a classification sheet and a set of rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you divide your dice throw among the riders, maximum four points per rider; you cannot win the race unles all your riders have reached a certain 'hot' point in the race; you have to play inmediately chance cards but you can keep tactic cards (you take a card for each rider that finishes his move in red fields).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strange is that the riders also have to pass barriers and gates. The game is played over several stages. In each stage points can be scored depending on your result in that stage. After all stages have been completed the total from all stages is added up to determine the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
