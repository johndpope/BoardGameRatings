							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City Center</name>
									
			<description>City Center is a map-building / tile-laying game about planning a city. City planners (the players) take turns placing new buildings into the grid. After each round of placement, the new buildings are scored and the next round commences. When the whole city grid is filled in, the game is over and the planner with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an additional twist, each player has full knowledge of the tiles she'll choose from right at the beginning. Once a player draws her hand of buildings, there are no more draws. She'll have to play all but two of the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game scales from 2 to 7 players by increasing the size of the city grid and eventually decreasing the number of cards in the hand. For instance, at 2 players, the city will grow to 4x4 and each player will have a hand of 10. At 7, the city is 6x6 and the players have a hand of only 7. Each player gets an equal number of chances to score; sometimes an initial card is played (unscored) to start off the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
