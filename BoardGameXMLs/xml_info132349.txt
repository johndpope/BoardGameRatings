			<description>HIGHWAY TRAVEL is played while riding along the highway in an auto and may be played by two to four players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the cards and deal each player ten cards. After the cards have been dealt, players begin to locate objects along the road that match the cards in their hands. Upon seeing an object, the player should show the card, point out the object to the other players, and lay down the card from their hand. A player receiving duplicate cards in their hand may lay both cards down at a time upon seeing the object.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to lay down all of their cards WINS THE GAME. Special note: A player with the Road Hog card may lay it down upon seeing one auto pass another going in the same direction. Highway Numbers and Speed Limit amounts do not have to correspond with the numbers on the cards.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also includes rules for playing Road Hog, which is Old Maid but the Hog card is the one you do not want to end with in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
