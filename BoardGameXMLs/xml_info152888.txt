			<description>Angels: Michael's War is a card game for 2 to 4 players. In the game, players take the role of Heaven's commanders who are tasked with gathering Angels, and deploying them to defeat Demons and claim Major Victories for Heaven. The goal of the game is to have the most Victory Points by the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games contains 2 decks of cards, Infernal and Divine. to set up the game, players shuffle the Divine cards, deal out 4 cards to each player, and place the rest of the cards face down on the table to form the Divine deck. Next, players shuffle the Infernal cards together, place the Infernal cards face-down to form the Infernal deck for the game. Take the top 3 Infernal cards and place them face-up in a row on the table. This is the Center Row for the game. From here, the game plays in rounds with each player taking 1 turn in each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, they draw 1 Divine card from the deck and add it to their hand. Then, the player tries to defeat red Demon cards or claim purple Major Victory cards in the Center row by playing cards form their hand and matching the symbols on the Center Row cards. Any card played, defeated, or claimed goes to that player's Score pile. Once the player replaces any Center Row cards they took, it is the next player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there are no more Infernal cards to draw, no more Divine cards to draw, or 3 or more Major Victory cards have been claimed by players at the table. Players then discard all the cards in their hand, and total up the Victory Points on each card in their Score pile. The player with the most Victory Points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
