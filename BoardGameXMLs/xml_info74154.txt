			<description>From developer's site&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is Battle for Wesnoth?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Battle for Wesnoth is a turn-based strategy game with a fantasy theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build up a great army, gradually turning raw recruits into hardened veterans. In later games, recall your toughest warriors and form a deadly host against whom none can stand! Choose units from a large pool of specialists, and hand-pick a force with the right strengths to fight well on different terrains against all manner of opposition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wesnoth has many different sagas waiting to be played out. Fight to regain the throne of Wesnoth, of which you are the legitimate heir... step into the boots of a young officer sent to guard a not-so-sleepy frontier outpost... vanquish a horde of undead warriors unleashed by a foul necromancer, who also happens to have taken your brother hostage... guide a band of elvish survivors in an epic quest to find a new home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;200+ unit types. 16 races. 6 major factions. Hundreds of years of history. The world of Wesnoth is absolutely huge and limited only by your creativity - make your own custom units, compose your own maps, and write your own scenarios or even full-blown campaigns. You can also challenge up to 8 friends - or strangers - and fight in epic multi-player fantasy battles.&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Build up a formidable fighting force, starting from a single leader and a small amount of gold.&lt;br/&gt;     Over 200 unit types in six major factions, all with distinctive abilities, weapons and spells.&lt;br/&gt;     Experienced units gain powerful new abilities as they advance.&lt;br/&gt;     Several multi-player options available, including internet play.&lt;br/&gt;     Scores of different custom-designed maps, and unlimited random maps.&lt;br/&gt;     Hundreds of campaign scenarios available for download via a simple in-game procedure.&lt;br/&gt;     'Fog of war' feature available for a true test of generalship.&lt;br/&gt;     Sophisticated mark-up language lets advanced users make their own maps, factions or campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;     Excellent language support 35 different languages currently available.&lt;br/&gt;     Windows, Mac OS X, GNU/Linux, RISC OS, BeOS, Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, AmigaOS4, OS/2 &amp;amp; eComStation compatible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
