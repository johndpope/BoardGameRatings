			<description>Street Proz was a street football collectible card game. Each player had a deck of at least 30 player cards, each with an Offensive, Defensive, and Wild rating. Dice are rolled to determine which player from each deck is matched up, and yardage is won or lost based on these ratings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was also a online fantasy football league tie in at the now defunct StreetProz.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
