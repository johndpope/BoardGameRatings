			<description>In Come About players are maritime merchant traders in command of a fleet of trading ships navigating along many perilous trade routes. The player with the most ships along the most  number of trade routes is declared &amp;ldquo;Nauclerokubernetes&amp;rdquo;, the Greek word for merchant-master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Materials&lt;br/&gt;64 double sided tiles, two sets of 32 tiles in two colors Red and Green.&lt;br/&gt;A way of keeping score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play&lt;br/&gt;Come About is played on a board-less playing surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two players Red and Green have each two sets of 16 double sided tiles in their chosen color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red starts by placing a tile either side up onto the table.&lt;br/&gt; Players then take turns placing a tile alongside another existing tile, connecting trade routes ( the dotted lines) across tile edges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all the tiles have been played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A trade route is a continuous dotted line or loop containing 3 or more ships in either players color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player having the majority of ships in his color on a trade route scores 1 point for each of his ships. If a trade route has an equal number of ships in both colors, then neither player scores along that trade route.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
