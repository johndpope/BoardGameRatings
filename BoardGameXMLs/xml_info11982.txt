			<description>From the packaging:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Getting To Know You...Better...a delightful and entertaining game for any two people who want to get to know each other better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who is it for?  Getting To Know You...Better was created for two people, any age, dating, married or just friends.  It's an ideal gift for Christmas, Valentine's, weddings, bridal showers, anniversaries, birthdays or whenever the players want to share a wonderful time together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How is it played?  Each player privately selects an activity from a List of Prizes.  As the players move around the board, they answer questions about their life experiences, preferences, wishes and attitudes.  Some cards offer the players an opportunity to guess what their partner would select as his/her choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The questions are often humorous, always entertaining and are carefully written so that embarrassing or uncomfortable subjects are avoided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At a future date, the person who loses the Game arranges for the activity that the winner has chosen.  However, because the players share the activity, both players actually win.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
