			<description>Touring with your Hillman Imp, The Modern Car Race Game is a simple roll and move game where accidents and detours along the way slow you down. This was basically an advertisement game for the Hillman Imp Automobile. &amp;quot;At the same time that Chevrolet was developing prototypes for the Corvair, the Rootes Group in England was designing a smaller but similar rear engine economy car, the Hillman Imp.  Development of the Imp began in 1955, but production did not start until 1963, three years after the Corvair was introduced.  The Imp remained in the Rootes lineup until 1976.&amp;quot; the IMP was known as the Poor Man's Porsche and was designed by Allan V. Lacki.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
