							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">StarSpeed 17: Rocket Racers of Galaxy 5000</name>
									
			<description>Thousands of years ago, this galaxy was in turmoil. Many civilizations discovered the power of Grotons as an energy source, and used it to master interplanetary travel. Unfortunately, they found their neighbors very difficult to relate to. The one thing they all seemed to have in common was their pride in their ability to travel through space, and they all liked to show off. Before long they began having periodical competitions to see who had the better spaceships, and this eventually grew into this regular race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose an alien race to represent in the race, and they determine the shape of the course. Planets along the course can be chosen at random, and each racer is assigned a Home world and a Rival world, which provide benefits and disadvantages during the race. Who will demonstrate their superior technology and racing skills by crossing the finish line first and win the Groton Cup?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play Speed cards to move your Rocket along the track and to break orbit from the planets along the way. Status cards played against you by other players will slow you down, but can be repaired using matching Remedy cards. Equipping your ship will protect you from Status cards, but if the status is powerful enough it could destroy your equipment!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also features a unique 'Last Place' rule, where the player at the back of the pack gets an extra turn each round to try and catch up to the rest, or blow past them if the circumstances permit. Last Place can change hands multiple times each race, and it's really not a bad place to be!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
