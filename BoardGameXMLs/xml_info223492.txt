			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A way to get new gamers famliliar without the rules!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A way to get new gamers familiar without the rules! Fisaco is hands down one of the best and easiest ways to get new gamers familiar with the concepts around roleplaying. When you are faced with a group of new gamers who have done minimal gaming, it's hard to get them used to the idea of roleplaying and the tropes of fantasy gaming at the same time as throwing all of the rules at them. The First Adventure takes the Fiasco model and turns it into a way to familiarize new players with gaming without burdenign them with the rules. Built to create the characters for a group and run them through their origin story as a party, The First Adventure dovetails into character creation or the next adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A &amp;quot;Hacked&amp;quot; version of Fiasco that modifies the tilt, act structure, and outcome to lead to group unity.&lt;br/&gt;    A broad fantasy setting that will make it easy for new players to attach concepts to D&amp;amp;D/fantasy gaming tropes and dovetail with your own setting.&lt;br/&gt;    Players choose Races and Classes based on basic options so they are ready to move into character creation.&lt;br/&gt;    Relationships, Needs, Locations, and Objects &amp;amp; Rivals help do collaborative setting building amongst the players to create a group unity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The First Adventure is exatly what you need for teaching a group of players new to the game &amp;mdash; or new to roleplaying all together &amp;mdash; how to roleplay and get invested in gaming fantasy tropes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
