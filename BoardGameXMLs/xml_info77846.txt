			<description>Robotrek (released under the title of Slapstick (スラップスティック?) in Japan) is a role-playing game released in 1994. It was published by Enix and developed by Quintet and Ancient for the SNES video game console.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As its Japanese name implies, Robotrek was intended as a humorous game. Designed to appeal to a younger audience, Robotrek's main focus is on allowing the player to raise up to three robots which are built from spare parts that may be found, gained through battles, or generated by the player by means of the game's item combination system. Next Generation describes it as a predecessor to the core idea of Pok&amp;eacute;mon in the sense that the protagonist does not himself fight, but sends out his robots to do so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robotrek has similar gameplay to that of most RPG video games, with the notable exception that the main character is not the combatant, but rather, the robots he invents are. The robots are highly customizable, in aspects such as equipment, special attacks, body color and name. The player is allowed to build a maximum of three robots. Unlike many RPGs, the player must invent or create the robots equipment, use &amp;quot;Program Points&amp;quot; to set the robot's attributes (as opposed to these attributes being set by the game), and program special attacks in a macro-like fashion, although certain commands do special effects instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Robotrek , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
