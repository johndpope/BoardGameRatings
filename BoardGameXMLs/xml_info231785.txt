			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They say that a picture is worth a thousand words...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Deck of Tales is a set of 120 card faces (not counting the instructions) that provide images as inspiration for story telling. Roleplayers, solo gamers, and authors can take advantage of 360 pictures, 240 unique combinations of symbols, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those numbers may sound relatively small, but consider this: Relying solely on the primary pictures, drawing three cards and using one image from each offers a possible set of more than 46 million random results, even before you apply your own interpretation to them! Whether you need to invent a unique backstory for an NPC, create a set of superpowers for the heroes of your world, or even just want some ideas for an interesting random encounter, the Deck of Tales offers sparks to set your imagination firing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DoT Key Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These cards were inspired by feedback on Larcenous Designs' first set of GM-assistant cards, The GameMaster's Apprentice, which are extremely information-dense by virtue of much text. Now, for those who prefer iconography for generating random events, creating multi-faceted NPCs, and even answering questions normally directed to a GM, The Deck of Tales offers a visual alternative!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
