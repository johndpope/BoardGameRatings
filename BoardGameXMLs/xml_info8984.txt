							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">In The Chips: Silicon Valley</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Welcome to the Silicon Valley! You'll soon be traveling through the Santa Clara Valley on its main highway, earning income, buying a new car, buying a home, and making investment decisions. Naturally, you can succeed or fail; just like reality, some of the decisions are up to you.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many elements in this game are real businesses, Intel, HP, Varian, Memorex, San Jose Mercury, Stanford, San Jose State, Sant Clara Univ. Local major Banks, Auto dealers, Real Estate companies real places.  Months of research planning and coperation and their participation. No one was ever charged to be in the game. It really played well. It would have to be done by 4 locals to understand how it had a strategy and used math skills other than counting bills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One person surmised--Appears to be a conversion of 'The Game of Life' to a local region similar to the multitude of '-opolys'  -but never played it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This board game was the most succesful in the region of San Francisco/Silicon Valley for 11/80-1/82 selling about 30,000 copies. Only behind a popular toy Rubik's Cube. Later others ITC San Francisco, ITC Hawaii, ITC New York, RW Marathon Game, Dotto and lastly a solo effort the official-KFAT Gilroy Garlic Game 5K&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Chips was invented by Terry Bohme, born in Palo Alto, where he attended Mayfield grammar school on El Camino adjoining Page Mill Rd.. His great great grandfather Batist Rev. Henry Merrill Henderson led his family there in 1852 and lived near Grant Road/El Camino, called Fremont Mayfield, now Mountain View. Terry attended Monte Loma- Mt. View, Benton-Sunnyvale, Pomeroy/LC Curtis- Santa Clara, and graduated Buchser HS '71 in Santa Clara. His mother Luella (Palo Alto HS '48) worked at Farnsworth, Ampex, Dalmo Victor, Fairchild, HP, Memorex, Philco and others. The game was devoloped with his cousin, Gary Suda, from April of 1980 intended for 9/80 delivery it way delayed till 11/26/80. Many elements of the game are from personal interactions he and the family had living in 'Silicon Vally'. Including knowing most of the companies from birth. His Uncle Herman Williams was a police sargent at Stanford University, his Uncle John Suda owned Stanford Plumbing &amp;amp; Heating, his Uncle Elmer Silva ran his own Magazine/Candy Concession at HP corp on Page Mill and raced a horse at Bay Meadows he used a barn on the corner of Page Mill/El Camino. His Uncle Ernie Larsen was the great grandson of Espinosa &amp;amp; Secundino Robles, the Pena Rancho owner of 3/4 of all Palo Alto. They lived in 2 houses @415 Cambridge and played on California while the grandparents owned Barron Park Cab. A lustrious group of family that did not have much education nor money, nor property by 1950s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terry had been a Navy Photographer and was attending De Anza/Foothill at the time. He being a year older at Monte Vista than Steve Jobs, would only meet the 2 Steves later in 1977 at Cupertino's Focus Camera shop he managed and did some early photography for Apple and handled some routine finishing. In'78 he became the Photographer for San Jose Magazine (Gill Cable) and became more intune with the phenomena that was occuring in the county. In 79-80 he worked as a minor salesman for Bantam Books, and made many bookstore/distributor/publicity rounds. A low paying job, it allowed him to meet many famous authors of the day, gain confidence and inspiration. It was really a local SF Radio show's detective contest about a detective travelling everywhere in the bay area, that inspired a Silicon Valley based game from what had already started as a book about Silicon Valley Gurus, the leaders who were not yet the celebs they are now. Access was still rather simple. In 1984-85 he worked as a salesman and developer for Nolan Bushnell's Axlon; selling assorted Trivia card games, AG Bears, Compu Bots, &amp;amp; Petsters. Here he met Stanford student Bob Moog, who was freelancing, Bob was very ambitious and like Steve Jobs sought greener pasture, as no one could gain security with Nolan. Bob bought a Murder Mystery game from a lady back east that had a following at the time, and with that later started University Games. Terry was responsible for promoting and introducing him to John N Hansen, a friend he had known since '81, John was like an uncle, and was a very succesful game publisher and distributor. Through John Hansen, Bob was able to get much needed distribution. Later he &amp;amp; John's relationship grew. Dave Scanlin, Terry's cousin, is VP of Sales for University Games 2009-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
