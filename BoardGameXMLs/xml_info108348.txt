			<description>Fields of Battle is a  simple tabletop wargaming ruleset published in Warlock Magazine issue #12. The game is designed to introduce Fighting Fantasy gamebooks readers to tabletop gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are derived from the Fighting Fantasy rules: each unit has a STRIKE and a STRENGTH rating (which work like FF's SKILL and STAMINA), and a MOVE and ATTACK score. Move is the distance the unit can move in inches, Attack the number of attacks per turn (most units have only one).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game turn, units move or fire, then combat between units in contact is resolved (each unit adds a 2d6 roll to its STRIKE rating, the unit with the lowest result loses 2 points of STRENGTH). After combat resolution, units that have suffered losses must pass a morale test or rout. A routing unit must test morale again in the next turn and is removed from the game if it fails that second test.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules also include a few special rules for flank attacks, cover, fortifications and siege engines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules come with a scenario (The Battle of Grey Rock) for which colour counters are included in the magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
