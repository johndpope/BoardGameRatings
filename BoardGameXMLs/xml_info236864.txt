			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hollow West is a role-playing game set in a Wild West at the centre of the Hollow Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is hollow, and deep within the Earth&amp;rsquo;s depths is a lost world where dinosaurs still live. After the Spanish Conquest of Central America, the Aztec survivors escaped here and re-established their empire. Native Americans, displaced from their lands by the white man, have arrived more recently, and begun to set up hidden communities. This settlement, in turn, has led the European settlers in America here. Finding gold and gems, a promise of more has caused a new gold rush and a new wild frontier. Every day, the new Great Subterranean Railway line brings new settlers to New Texas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take on the role of cowboys, gunslingers, academics, Native Americans, and even occultists all looking for adventure on the edges of civilisation, in the wondrous and vast unknown of the Hollow Earth in the year 1895 AD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this book, we present complete game. There are rules for character generation, how to play, and details of this fantastic new Wild West. There are details of the different factions present, along with the geography of the Hollow Earth, supernatural beasts and a complete introductory scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses Fortune System is a light version of the Fate rules, somewhere between Fate Accelerated and Fate Core in complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
