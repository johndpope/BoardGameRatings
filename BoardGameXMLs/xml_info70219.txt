			<description>From the side of the box: Everyone is talking about the game that's a puzzle and the puzzle that's a game! Match the most mouths to their corresponding faces and win! Played alone or with friends, it's hilarious excitement while challenging visual discrimination and problem-solving skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the instructions: Object of the game is to match the mouths with the faces.  All of the mouths are placed on the table.  Players or teams pick out three face pieces from the box and try to be the first to match the face pieces to the mouths. A round ends when a player or team matches all three.  New rounds continue until all faces and mouths are matched.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
