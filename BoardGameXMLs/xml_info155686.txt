							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">U.S. President: Viribus Unitis</name>
									
			<description>Viribus Unitis is a competition version of U.S. President game. It differs mainly in its map. Unlike U.S. President with its modified map of the USA, Viribus Unitis is played on modified language/ethnical map of Austria-Hungary around the year 1910.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Viribus Unitis means &amp;quot;With united forces&amp;quot; in Latin and is known as personal motto of Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I.)&lt;br/&gt; Like in the U.S. President game, Viribus Unitis is Easy-Fast-Fun game with pyramids about the last 12 weeks of fictional election campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As far as the game mechanism is the same, tactics differ a bit, because in  Viribus Unitis all players put their pyramids simultaneously in all twelve rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For competitions are available free pdf files with tables to write down all moves and follow the track easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map for Viribus Unitis consists of ten main ethnic (language) groups of Austria-Hungary in 1910 and The City of Vienna as the eleventh district.&lt;br/&gt; There is no tricky district in Viribus Unitis (unlike Florida state in U.S. President game) and the game is meant for 3-6 players and 4 sets of pyramids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player need to secure at least 51 votes to win the game. In case of a tie, the one who secures votes in Vienna, wins the game.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
