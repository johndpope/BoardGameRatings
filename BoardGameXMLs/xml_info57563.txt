							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Segundai</name>
									
			<description>Decades ago, the colonists of Segundai realized that they would no longer be able to provide for their growing population within the boundaries of the original city. The leaders reluctantly agreed to let corporations form outside the city walls, encouraging them to discover land and farm it for the good of the whole colony. You are a young entrepreneurial colonist who wants to strike it rich in this &amp;quot;Food Gold Rush,&amp;quot; and hire a team to discover, claim, and farm new lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Segundai is a game for 2-4, played out on a world that is constantly expanding through tile placement. As the world increases in size, each player's scouts move across it, seeking the most valuable lands possible. Players can spend time building up a key spot to claim, or ruin an opponent's good position. However, simply getting the most valuable land does not guarantee victory, and timing is everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
