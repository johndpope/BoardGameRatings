			<description>Virtua Quest, known in Japan as Virtua Fighter Cyber Generation: Ambition of the Judgement Six (バーチャファイター サイバージェネレーション 〜ジャッジメントシックスの野望〜 Bācha Faitā Saibā Jenerēshon: Jajjimento Shikkusu no Yabō), is a Virtua Fighter spin-off title for the GameCube and PlayStation 2 video game consoles, although no PAL version of the game was released for either the PlayStation 2 or the GameCube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Virtua Quest is one where many people shrug off reality, and instead spend their free time in the Nexus, a vast virtual universe. Sei is a cheerful fellow who's been tapped by his friend, Hayami, into trying out the life of a hunter, one who collects data chips from the far-flung reaches of the Nexus and then sells them for cash. Sei, curious about the occupation, yet slightly intimidated by the dangers involved, reluctantly accepts after a bit of influence from Hayami, and the thought about the bike that they are trying to finish in time for the race in the real world. After completing the Hunters' test and a brief explanation from Hayami about the Hunter's License rankings (LoA, HighA, and ExA), Sei finds the server address for Curio City, and marks his way to the location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Virtua Quest&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
