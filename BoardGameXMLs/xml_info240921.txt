							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ariete: The Battle of Bir el Gubi, Libya</name>
									
			<description>Ariete is a Tactical Combat Series (TCS) game covering the Italian Ariete Division&amp;rsquo;s defense of Bir el Gubi, Libya, on November 19, 1941.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The well-equipped yet inexperienced British 22nd Armoured Brigade saw an opportunity to season itself against a supposedly weak Italian formation. At full-strength with 162 brand-new Crusader tanks, the British were eager to emulate the easy victories against the Italian 10th Army the previous winter. What actually ensued was a swirling desert battle between evenly matched opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ariete covers this entire mobile action in turns representing 30 minutes each and a map scale of 150 meters per hex. Units range from sections to platoons. A minimal amount of special rules bring the Tactical Combat Series to North Africa, highlighting the unique tactical challenge of the desert environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The Italian player must manage a mobile defense against stronger British armored units until reinforcements arrive in the form of the 132nd Tank Regiment. He must make good use of artillery and AT assets (especially truck-mounted 102mm guns) to bloody the Brits and set them up for an armored counterattack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The Commonwealth player must solve the problem of using an armor-only force to crack defensive positions held by a well-led combined-arms force. The desert environment, with swirling dust clouds and relatively long lines of sight, will not help him in this regard!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ariete components:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Tactical Combat Series version 4.01 rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Ariete game-specific rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 12 Scenarios:&lt;br/&gt;Destruction of the III/8 Bersaglieri, 2 turns&lt;br/&gt;The Nearest Thing to a Cavalry Charge, 6 turns&lt;br/&gt;The Attack on the 8th Bersaglieri, 6 turns&lt;br/&gt;The Attack on Bir el Gubi (Prepared Defense), 6 turns&lt;br/&gt;The Attack on Bir el Gubi (Early CW Arrival), 6 turns&lt;br/&gt;Attack of the 2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars, 10 turns&lt;br/&gt;Attack of the 4th County of London Yeomanry, 11 turns&lt;br/&gt;The Ram Strikes, 6 turns&lt;br/&gt;The Battle of Bir el Gubi (historical), 11 turns&lt;br/&gt;The Battle of Bir el Gubi (Prepared Defense), 11 turns&lt;br/&gt;The Battle of Bir el Gubi (Early CW Arrival), 12 turns&lt;br/&gt;The Battle of Bir el Gubi (Free Deployment), 11 turns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; two Tactical Combat Series Charts &amp;amp; Tables&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; one full-color 22&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot; map&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 280 counters (see a playtest [not final!] sample here)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; zip lock bag (*Note: In order to keep production costs down, we are producing Ariete as a bagged game only; there will not be a boxed edition.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
