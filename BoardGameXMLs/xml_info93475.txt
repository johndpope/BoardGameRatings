			<description>Chess variant played on a 10x10 board, where pawns can start moving up to three spaces forward instead of the traditional two spaces, and where there's a new piece, the Conquistador, placed between the Knight and the Bishop, that moves almost like a Knight: two spaces forward orthogonally followed by one space forward diagonally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was developed in 1965 but it has never been commercially released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
