			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'UNEARTHLY BEINGS' APPEAR OVER PARIS, FRANCE, KILL MANY.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Jim Goldman 13/11/2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-AAP, REUTERS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Confused reports continue to filter out of Paris, France, where reportedly long-dead Scandinavian Gods have made an appearance during Odin's 'Wild Hunt' of Yule. Ghostly apparitions have been successfully engaged by military jets of the French National Airforce over the skies of Paris during confused ground fighting with suspected ISIS suicide units somehow in religious conjunction with these religious figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;French ground units continue to battle ground units in restaurants and theaters around Paris as civilians stream out of the city center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beginning at 21:20 CET, three suicide bombers struck near the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, followed by suicide bombings and mass shootings at caf&amp;eacute;s, restaurants and a music venue in central Paris.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The attackers have killed 100 people, including 60 at the Bataclan theatre, where they took hostages before engaging in a continuing stand-off with police.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yule has traditionally been the time of Odin and Freya's 'Wild Hunt' where the Norse god and goddess range across the sky gathering souls for his Army of the Dead at The End of Time. Reputedly, anyone outdoors is liable to be slain ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A FULLY-ILLUSTRATED FULL-COLOR 17 PAGE LABYRINTH LORD/MUTANT FUTURE CAMPAIGN &amp;ndash; CONTAINING CITY-WIDE SEPERATE LOCATION ENCOUNTERS AND RANDOM ENCOUNTERS. INCLUDES SAMPLE MID-LEVEL MUTANT AND REPLICANT SUPERHERO AND GOD AND GODDESS CHARACTERS READY FOR PLAY.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
