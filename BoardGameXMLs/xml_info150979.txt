			<description>An abstract dice game, where there are 10 dice. There are 5 different figures and three different colors. Player rolls all the dice and chooses the matching pairs. The same figure and the same color are worth 3 points, same figures in different color are worth 1 point. Then the player can reroll the remaining dice and repeat the pair matching. If there are no pairs, then the player scores 0 points for that round. If the player voluntarily stops, then he scores points for the pairs and minus 1 for each unused die. When someone gets 100 points, each other player has one turn. The highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
