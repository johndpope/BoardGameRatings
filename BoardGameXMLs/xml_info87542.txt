							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood &amp; Guts 2.0: In Her Majesty&#039;s Service</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parachute into hostile territory with an SAS troop. Do the dirty deeds MI6 can't with the Increment. Take out terrorists holding a North Sea oil platform with M Squadron. Secure the landing site with the Pathfinders. Conduct deep penetration raids with the Brigade Patrol Troop. Do all this and more with Blood &amp;amp; Guts: In Her Majesty's Service v2, an update of the original B&amp;amp;G supplement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Packed with information on the elite and special operations forces of the United Kingdom, In Her Majesty's Service v2 also includes new weapons, equipment and vehicles, as well as a selection of medals from the UK. Every unit entry includes vital information such as organization, equipment and niche, as well as what kind of roles player characters could take on. Along with these units, there are three new prestige classes: close quarters assault training, combat diving training, and containment training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even if your campaign doesn't include any members of the UK military, this supplement is filled with ideas and inspiration for any modern or military campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
