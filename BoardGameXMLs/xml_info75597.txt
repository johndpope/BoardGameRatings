			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels, known in Japan as Super Mario Bros. 2 (スーパーマリオブラザーズ2 Sūpā Mario Burazāzu Tsū), is a platformer video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Family Computer Disk System. First released in Japan on June 3, 1986, it is the direct sequel to the second best-selling video game of all time, Super Mario Bros. Due to the game's high difficulty and similarity to its predecessor, Nintendo of America chose not to release it in the United States until the Nintendo Virtual Console release in 2007. A full remake, entitled Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels, was included as part of the Super Mario All-Stars collection for the Super NES. More recently, the original Disk System version was made available as a download (including North America) for the Wii Virtual Console as of 2007. Unlike the 16-bit SNES version, the Virtual Console version is the original Disk System version with all its original subtitles (although like Super Mario Bros., the original game was already entirely in English).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The premise of the game is identical to Super Mario Bros.: King Koopa has abducted Princess Toadstool and is holding her captive in one of his castles. Either Mario or Luigi must navigate through the Mushroom Kingdom, overcome Bowser's henchmen, and rescue the Princess. The game uses the same game engine as its predecessor and is quite similar in visual style; however, the level of difficulty is significantly higher. It is intended to challenge players who have mastered the original Super Mario Bros.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
