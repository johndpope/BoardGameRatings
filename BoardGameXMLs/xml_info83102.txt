			<description>Fairy Wars (妖精大戦争　～ 東方三月精, Yōsei Daisensō ~ Tōhō Sangessei, lit. Great Fairy Wars ~ Eastern Three Fairies) is a shoot 'em up game, and is the 12.8th official game in the Touhou Project by the dōjin circle Team Shanghai Alice. The game was released on August 14, 2010 at Comiket 78. The game is the sequel to the Touhou Sangessei manga series as the illustrations were done by Makoto Hirasaka, the manga artist of the series itself instead of ZUN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is sometimes called FW for short.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays somewhat like a fusion of the Shoot the Bullet series, and the Phantasmagoria series, combined with &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; Touhou gameplay. Cirno is able to shoot regularly, but also possesses a new &amp;quot;freezing&amp;quot; technique that adds a new twist to the game. Similar to Aya's camera, Cirno has an counter that fills up during gameplay, which determines the strength of her freeze attack, which is triggered by holding and then releasing the shot button not unlike the charged shots in the phantasmagoria games. When activated, Cirno's freeze attack will attack the immediate area directly in front of her, and freeze any bullets it comes in contact with for a duration proportionate to the level of charge % before vanishing afterward. When other bullets come into contact with frozen bullets, they too will freeze, allowing for large chains to be frozen in this way. Points and bombs are awarded for freezing large numbers of bullets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the main-series games, Fairy Wars contains full stages each home to their own specific midboss and boss. However, Cirno is the only playable character, and there are only three stages during a playthrough instead of six. On the other hand, though, there are four different &amp;quot;paths&amp;quot; the player may choose to take, which influence the stages they play. Three of the paths are playable upon starting, while the 4th path is unlockable. The three paths that are playable from the beginning also offers two different routes in which the story will progress (exactly like in Imperishable Night after beating Reisen).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Fairy Wars&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
