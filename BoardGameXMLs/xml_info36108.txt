			<description>&amp;ldquo;The British with superior numbers charge into a shower of cannon shot and sniper fire while attempting to install Ladders over the Rodriguez canal. Their goal is to overrun the American defenders, however their leadership and troop Strength is being decimated. Can the British complete the task before it is too late? Victory: The Americans win if all British units are destroyed. The British win if all American units are overrun. Otherwise the British score is the number of American units that were overrun. The British player with the highest score wins.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this abstract wargame, set during the War of 1812, the British units are represented by six-sided dice. The face-up number shows the strength of each unit. The units are moved down a twenty space track. Moving dice off the end of the track helps reduce the strength of the American forces by removing cards from the American Troop deck. The British win when all American Troop cards have been eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game may be played in three different ways: solitaire, two-player (American versus British), or multiplayer (two or more players play the British competing for high score).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
