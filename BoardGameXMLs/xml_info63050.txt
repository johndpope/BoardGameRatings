			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something's Got the Munchies...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you want a midnight snack in Las Calamas, there's only one place to go - the good ol' 24/7. This popular corner mini-mart has been the target of countless late-night munchy runs for over twenty years, drawing hungry customers with the promise of quick food and constant variety. Unfortunately, something else has gotten wise to the wonders of stop-and-go snacking - something with a thirst for human blood. Unraveling the clues of the bloody trail and exposing this supernatural serial killer won't be easy. It will require steady nerves, quick wits and plenty of ammo and microwave burritos. But no matter how fearsome and terrifying the foe, it's a line that must be drawn. Nobody messes with the neighborhood mini-mart...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's Inside...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Midnight Snack is a complete adventure for Horror Rules, the Simply Horrible RPG, a horror comedy game of ridiculous proportions. This supplement is packed with everything you need to play, including Bad Guys, Cast, backstory, artwork, Plot Pushers and enough Sequel Suggestions and Plot Twists to turn it into five adventures instead of one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
