			<description>FrenchTots&lt;br/&gt;  very first French words through songs and games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FrenchTots has been compiled by Teresa Scibor, a leading expert in teaching languages to young children.&lt;br/&gt;She runs the very popular French clubs, Le Club Tricolore and Tricolore Tots, on the principle that children learn languages best when they are having fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teresa Scibor has drawn on her experience in creating FrenchTots. It introduces new words at just the right pace&lt;br/&gt;and the cassette tape uses songs, games, sound effects and a touch of humor to making learning fun. Your child will enjoy listening to it again and again, at home or in the car, which ensures they'll build plenty of confidence with their first French words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
