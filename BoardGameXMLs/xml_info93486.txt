							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fuzzle</name>
									
			<description>Fuzzle is a classic, highly addictive puzzle game, that is both simple yet challenging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Move the balls around the board to create lines of five balls of the same color. Every time you finish a row, the balls are removed. But after every other move you make, more balls are added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional to the plain colored balls, two special balls are provided - the rainbow ball, which serves as any colour, and the bomb ball, which clear all balls of the line's color from the board. Use these wisely in your quest to survive as long as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With fast gameplay, smooth graphics, and intuitive tap-handling - making the selection+moving of the stones fast+easy - this game will keep you entertained for hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
