							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hyboria&#039;s Finest: Nobles, Scholars &amp; Soldiers</name>
									
			<description>Devi Yasmina&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thoth-amon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amalric of Aquilonia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who are they? Nobles, scholars and soldiers are mainstays of the Conan stories as well as the focus of this rule-book. Nobles wield wealth and influence; scholars wield knowledge and alchemy; soldiers wield swords and bows. Each has their arena of expertise. Each are specialists, experts in their fields but uncomfortable and often ineffective outside of their specialty. The nobles tread the jewelled thrones of the Earth, hovering around the perfumed courts and palaces of the Hyborian Age like flies around a carcass. Scholars delve deep into books and tombs, seeking answers to riddles most men shudder to even conceive. Soldiers are the masters of the battlefield, mastering their weapons to a degree few can even hope to attain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
