			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the spring and knob from a shoe tree, you manage a lever that controls a green dot moving through an LED light strip. You'll sometimes come upon enemies represented as red dots, and you'll have to combat these by wobbling the spring lever, which results in your avatar turning yellow and bouncing around a few inches in a dash attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
