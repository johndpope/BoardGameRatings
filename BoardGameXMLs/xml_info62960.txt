							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Pinocchio Game</name>
									
			<description>Players follow Pinocchio's adventures around the game board, trying to be the first to reach Pinocchio's dream and become a real boy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players spin the spinner and either go back or forward a number of spaces, or draw a card.  If a player draws an adventure card, she announces it and lays the card face down on the corresponding adventure on the board, and moves ahead 3 spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player draws a nose card, Pinocchio has told a lie, and player must go back 3 spaces, UNLESS she chooses to bluff, by claiming it as an adventure card, and placing it face down on an adventure space.  If challenged by another player and caught out in a lie, she must go back 5 spaces as a penalty.  If challenged falsely, she may go forward 5 spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First player to the finish wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
