			<description>An educational game about the protection of the rain forest. 4 bulldozers are placed at the outer border of the board. The players get a certain amount of rain forest cards in their hands.&lt;br/&gt;A player plays a card and draws a new rain forest card. Aim of the game is to plant 25 trees onto the clearing as fast as possible. If you play a foster card, you can plant a tree and draw a new card. Another possibility to plant a tree is to collect three cards of a type (animal or plant) in a row.&lt;br/&gt;Every time you plant a tree you get a certificate. The third possible card is a question card, which can be asked to any player. If he has a sin card in his hand, the questioner gets a certificate, otherwise the questioner has to give one certificate to the other player. The player can also lie about having a sin card. Then the player can ask for a vote of confidence and the player, who loses must pay two certificates.&lt;br/&gt;Players then replenish their hands and have to fight off the bulldozers. A clearing card is being revealed and the players have to match the values on the card with the values on their disclaimer cards. If they win, the difference is payed out in form of trees and certificates. If they lose, the bulldozers move for every point of difference into the forest.&lt;br/&gt;In the end the players win, if 25 trees are planted. The player with most certificates is the overall winner. If the bulldozers reach the last section of the board all players lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
