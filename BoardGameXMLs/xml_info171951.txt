							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deck of Dice: Cypher System</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your next cypher system game, instead of reaching for a d20, why not reach for a Dice Card!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This deck of 60 cards provides the same random possibilities that were traditionally accomplished by using dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Difficulty levels are pre-calculated, in addition to partial steps (displayed by the floating colored orbs around the number)&lt;br/&gt;    Each card also includes a six sided roll (mostly used for recovery rolls)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to this simplification, the partial steps are coded into three colors, red, green and blue, of which you could create special house-rules that could result when the color drawn matches the partial step on the card. (you dont have to do this, but the option is there for you to implement such rules)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;the quantity of the cards perfectly match d6 and d20 roll ratios&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
