			<description>One day Prince John decides to raise the taxes on all the people of Nottingham.  So he sends the Sheriff of Nottingham and his men out to collect the taxes.  After the Sheriff has collected the taxes he returns to Prince John's castle and places all the gold in Prince John's treasure room.  The people of Nottingham are already poor and many of them are left with no money at all after paying their taxes.  The poor people send a message telling of the new tax to Robin Hood and his band of merry men who live deep in the heart of Sherwood Forest......&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the Disney production of Robin Hood.  Each player selects a character (Robin Hood, Little John, Friar Tuck or Maid Marion).  The first person to get the bag of gold from Prince John and return to Robin's Forest Hideout is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
