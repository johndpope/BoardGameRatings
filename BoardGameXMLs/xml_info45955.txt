			<description>&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A book composed of mini adventures for TimeLords second edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the hedonistic decadence of a future beyond imagining, to the censored and rationed world of our desperate grandchildren, to the distant past where history and legend overlap, Time Capsules has something for everyone. A set of 16 short backgrounds for quick adventures or ideas for campaign settings, Time Capsules will pit the players against everything from the environment to the Patrol to each other. Each capsule is complete with NPC's, maps, and special rules to cover the unusual situations that invariably occur in multidimensional travel and adventures can range in length from hours to years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're looking for campaign inspiration, or just a source of quick material for those Jumps between longer adventures, Time Capsules has something for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
