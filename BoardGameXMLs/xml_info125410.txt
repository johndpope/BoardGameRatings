							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Martian Empires</name>
									
			<description>Martian Empires is a set of Fast Play rules for Victorian Science Fiction Games using 15mm figures. It has been written to accompany the Martian Empires range of 18mm figures also sold by Black Hat Miniatures. The rules are in full colour throughout and run to 52 pages plus the cover. They include the full rules, army lists and five scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player commands an army of figures, depicting terrestrial or Martian troops, mounted onto stands (recommended frontage 40mm for 15/18mm figures). Ranges are determined by measurement (no grid), firing and close combat are resolved by dice rolls. Leaders are needed to order troops and vehicles to move, but soldiers sensibly fire at visible enemies on their own initiative. Victory or defeat conditions are scenario-based.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
