			<description>The game consists of 88 playing pieces which can be clicked together. Some contain numbers, others contain mathematical operations. There are also cards with numbers and a die. Two cards are flipped open and the players try to produce a mathematical equation with the two-digit number from the cards as a result. Then a die is rolled. On a result of one, the active player can steal pieces from the other players, 2-5 allow him/her to draw new pieces and a 6 means a completed equation is taken away. When all pieces are used up, the player with most pieces in equations is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
