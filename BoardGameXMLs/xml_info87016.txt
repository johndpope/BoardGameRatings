			<description>From Overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Appearances can be deceiving. Most people know this, but still fall into the trap of not questioning too deeply. In some cases, this failure can have a high cost, such as when dealing with the rin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rin are fully aware of what others believe. It is easy to see the massive frame and assume it belongs to a hulking brute of limited intelligence. Rin do nothing to dissuade this misconception. In fact, rin intentionally perpetuate the stereotype that they are ignorant, solitary, short-lived beasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In truth, rin are cunning trappers who may live for centuries hidden under swampy waters. The cultural xenophobia of the rin is the only thing keeping these intelligent, powerful creatures from pursuing conquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
