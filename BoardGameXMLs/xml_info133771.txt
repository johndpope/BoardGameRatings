							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tomb Raider (2000/GBC)</name>
									
			<description>Tomb Raider is a action-adventure video game, released in 2000 for the Game Boy Color. The title was developed by Core Design and was published by Eidos Interactive and THQ. This release is significant as it is the first portable game in the Tomb Raider series and the first Tomb Raider game not to be rated T by the ESRB. Although it shares its title with the first entry in the series, Tomb Raider for Game Boy Color follows a different storyline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tomb Raider (Game Boy Color)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
