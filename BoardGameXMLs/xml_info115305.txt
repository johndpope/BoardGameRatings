			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Control a snake, avoid the demons. There are a few differences between this and Shadow Snake. You can eat your own tail, which encourages more graceful movement. Your snake lengthens with each sun chip eaten, making things more difficult. The levels are set up so after beating one level you go to the next, rather than each level being independent. There are upgrades available such as leaving sun chips behind after damaged, being able to free hits and gaining energy from sun chips. The game rates your performance, so you can attempt to beat previous records.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
