			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Gen Con-exclusive &amp;quot;flip book&amp;quot; features The Golden Auroch on one side and Tower of the Black Peark on the other!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Golden Auroch: Evil has always blown upon the hot winds of Sumer, but never has there been a land as oppressive and intent on discord than Ur. For decades the people of this city-state were held prisoner by their mage-queen, Nicrotis, and neighboring lands quivered whenever her armies marched. Central to Nicrotis' power, both at home and afar, was her possession of a holy statue called the Golden Auroch. In time, the gods took notice and intervened, reducing the entire city of Ur to dust in a fierce sandstorm that lasted forty years. Now, a century later, the city-state of Akkad is in the midst of a drought of unimaginable length and intensity. Not a single drop of rain has fallen for three years. The only hope for salvation lies in traveling to the cursed ruins of Ur, braving the Tomb of Nicrotis located below them, and returning with the Golden Auroch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tower of the Black Pearl: Once every decade, the tides of the Empyrean Ocean recede far enough to reveal the highest eaves of a mysterious undersea tower. Long ago this was the eldritch fastness of a powerful mage, but now the tower is known simply as the final resting place of the fabled Black Pearl -- an artifact rumored to bring doom upon all who dare to posses it. Tonight the moon nearly fills the sky, and the tides have already begun to recede. The heroes have eight short hours to explore the tower before the dark waters return...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure module was designed exclusively for Gen Con 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
