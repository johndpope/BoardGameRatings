			<description>The game has 260 cards each containing one topic (e.g. major American countries) and six solutions (e.g. Brazil; Mexico; USA; Canada; Peru; Argentina) each one represented in one color. A hidden die with six colors is rolled and, depending on the color you or your team gets (which only the opponent player or team knows) you have to ask questions to the other player or team to discover the correct answer, determined by the colored die.&lt;br/&gt;As more as your answers are correct the more you walk on the board. The game is finished when you complete the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
