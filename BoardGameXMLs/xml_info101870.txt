			<description>CrazyControl 2 is unlike any of the existing side scrolling games that you&amp;rsquo;ve seen, or played, before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine an energetic, challenging and exciting game with multiple characters under your control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CrazyControl 2 starts with two characters running side-by-side, with the number of characters multiplying until a maximum of six characters must be controlled by a player at once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is challenging and as such demands the full attention of new players. But after a player perfects their skills and clears the final stage, they can easily chat on messenger and talk on the phone, at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenario&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The forest of eternity that protects the village is threatend by an unidentified evil spirit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the trees in the forest are barren, and strange things begin to happen in the forest. The villagers are being threatened by unknown monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To solve the mystery, the village chief orders his guards to find the source of evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The guards get closer and closer to uncovering the source of the evil, but when they have almost succeeded, a monumental betrayal transpires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
