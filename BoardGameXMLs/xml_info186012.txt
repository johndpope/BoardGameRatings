			<description>Don't Go Alone, the first expansion for Pocket Dungeon Quest, adds new concepts to the core gameplay that gives additional strategic choices to the Heroes. It also introduces campaigns and equipment upgrades that carry over through many sessions of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gear is the highlight of the Don't Go Alone expansion. Gear in PDQ is pieces of equipment that the Hero pulls out of the Treasure Pile as a reward for Leveling Up. There are many different types of Gear which add loads of new skills and abilities to the Heroes as they adventure through the dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gear is earned by killing Monsters and Leveling Up and finding keys on the Dungeon Floor. Hardcore players can randomize which pieces of Gear they equip. Otherwise you get to choose which combination of Gear best fits with your style of play. Mix and match the Gear for interesting effects and abilities, and most of all, HAVE FUN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
