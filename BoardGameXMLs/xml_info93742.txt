							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle for the Ancient Robot</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;A New Kind of Game&lt;br/&gt;Inside are two books for two players. One of you becomes E-Ben, a gigantic combat robot. The other becomes his enemy, Earth star pilot Mikael. The two of you are engaged in a desperate race to find the powerful parts of the Ancient Robot that an early civilization scattered throughout space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You each have a star chart. You know where the Ancient Robot parts are located. But even before you face your enemy in the final showdown, you encounter strange alien races that will either help you in your quest -- or blast you out of the skies! (Your opponent takes the part of all aliens and monsters you fight, just as you take the part of any enemies he faces!) An east, diceless combat system simulates battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a race against time and each other to see who can come up with the most parts for the Ancient Robot! Each part is valuable. The more parts you obtain, the better your chances for victory are at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything you need to play is provided: two books, maps, Combat Table, Character Sheets. No dice required. All you provide is one friend and two pencils!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAY ANYTIME! ANYWHERE!&lt;br/&gt;PLAY MANY TIMES!&lt;br/&gt;THE GAME IS ALWAYS DIFFERENT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck in your BATTLE FOR THE ANCIENT ROBOT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
