							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Numereji (Pathinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This giant serpent has a third eye and shimmering, rainbow-hued scales. It sinuously moves through the air like it was swimming through water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The numereji were born from starlight refracting through the first comet&amp;rsquo;s tail. The rainbow serpents were tasked by ancient gods to seed the cosmos with water and life. Though the beings who gave the numereji their purpose are now long dead, the world-shapers persist as universal forces of creation and destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The serpents travel from world to world, creating water where there is none, or carving the terrain with erosion. In their wake travel microscopic organisms, acting as the first seeds from which entire ecosystems evolve. Barren, rocky worlds of arid dust might become beautiful and thriving at the passage of a numereji. However, the rainbow serpents wish to shape all worlds, regardless of prior habitation. The darkest among them might wash a thriving planet clean to begin again, and even the kindliest rainbow serpents could unintentionally spread alien plagues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
