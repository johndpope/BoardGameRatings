							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paper Rails USA</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Rail Road Building Theme. Pen and Paper Game: No cards or dice needed. This is a modified PnP version of Railroad Dispatch USA.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a map of the United States marked with cities. The players build rail connections by drawing lines between the cities. Building rail lines is one of the means of acquiring Victory Points. Additional Victory Points are scored when the player duplicates the circuit covered by historical rail lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game adds additional flavor to this basic framework through the Income, Research, and Stock Points tracked for each player's railway. A series of Events can affect these point values as well, based on historical events that influenced nineteenth rail travel in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Income, Research, and Stock Point values also serve to increase a player's Victory Point total. Victory Points can also be scored based on the type of commodities produced in the cities connected to a player's rail lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Materials required for play: Two pens with different colored ink, a coin, a printout of the game map, and a copy of the scoring tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
