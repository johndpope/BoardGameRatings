			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the original adventure set in Hanan Pacha! The black vrock demon lord, Varnaku) has returned to Elleron Forest and defeated the noble dragon guarding the sacred, Stairway of the Gods. Minions of Varnaku (whose true name is &amp;quot;Black Death&amp;quot;), have ravaged the countryside and the secretive Druidic Council has sent out a plea for help. Valiant heroes are needed in this time of trouble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your adventurers stumble upon the devestated village of Buckshire. If they decide to help the community out, they will battle orcs, ogres, gargoyles and vrocks. The adventurers have the option of visiting the demon plane of Lord Varnaku, rescue a missing wizard and finally lead an assault on the Spire that Varnaku and Its minions desecrate with their demonic presence! The quest to retake the sacred stairway is on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 3.5 adventure module is for characters level 8-12 but can be adjusted to lower levels by reducing the numbers of monsters. Be sure and look for the other adventures in the Hanan Pacha series. All four link together in political events through the storyline. Our world is truly unique and priced low for the benefit of you: the customer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
