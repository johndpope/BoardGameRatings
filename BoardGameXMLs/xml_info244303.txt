			<description>The Basic Variant is for 2-year-old kids and is a memory game. &lt;br/&gt;Take 2 sets of &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; tiles with red and yellow borders and add 4 random tiles with orange borders.&lt;br/&gt;The youngest player starts, then play clockwise. The player takes a random tile from those face down and turns it up:&lt;br/&gt;If you find a tile with just 1 figure, then search for the corresponding bee and &amp;ldquo;make it fly&amp;rdquo; taking it up. The turn passes to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;If you find a tile showing all 5 bees... what a pity! Something scared them away and made them fly away! For this turn, you can&amp;rsquo;t try to make anyone fly.&lt;br/&gt;When you complete an entire line of 6 tiles of the same type compared to those with just one image, you win, well done!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Advanced Version is for 4-year-old kids. This is a competitive variant. &lt;br/&gt;The youngest player starts and then the others in a clockwise direction.&lt;br/&gt;The active player receives the pile of tiles.&lt;br/&gt;When everyone is ready, the current player says &amp;quot;Happy!&amp;quot; And turns the first tile of the stack quickly, resting it on the table face up so that it is clearly visible to all.&lt;br/&gt;In games with 5 or 6 players, the active player simultaneously turns 2 tiles instead of 1.&lt;br/&gt;All the players try to get to &amp;quot;fly&amp;quot; the bees indicated by tiles turned just taking them and raising them.&lt;br/&gt;The player or players who remain without a bee...&lt;br/&gt;....is forced to take a token web at random which must be kept the secret to their opponents until the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;Replace all the bee shapes on the board and discard the tiles used. The stack of tiles is then passed to the next player clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;If there are not enough tiles to play a new round, shuffle those already used and discarded earlier.&lt;br/&gt;When just 4 or less web tokens are left, the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;All players turn over their spider web tokens: the player who has collected less spiders wins. In case of a tie, the player who has fewer spider web tokens and in case of further tie there are several winners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
