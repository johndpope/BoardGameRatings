			<description>From the publisher's website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Unapproachable East Forgotten Realms Web Enhancement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The citizens of Phent, which is a large town in Thesk, are a proud, yet warm and accepting folk. For the past nine years, they have been host to over six hundred orcs, which is certainly an anomaly in the average Faer&amp;ucirc;nian community. In 1360 DR, Zhentil Keep sent one thousand orcs to aid in the fight against the westward-sweeping Tuigan hordes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The orcs fought well-well enough that the citizens of Thesk welcomed them as citizens when Zhentil Keep abandoned them in this land in 1363 DR. Still, a current of unsettling concern lingers. Some believe that the orcs are still part of Zhentil Keep&amp;rsquo;s strike force, but that they went on standby to wait for the moment when their masters give the signal. Once allowed, these orcs may launch a crippling attack from within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, in nine years, no signal has been given-at least none that any of the paranoid folk have noticed. The orcs are enthusiastic citizens and, apart from some rowdiness during breaks from the mines or fields, they have hurt no one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And then, a prophet comes, with a message of war . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In A Call to Arms, the player characters (PCs) have a chance to prevent orcs from rising up against some humans. This adventure is designed for four 9th-level D&amp;amp;D characters. The encounters can be adjusted up or down to suit your group&amp;rsquo;s needs, however.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
