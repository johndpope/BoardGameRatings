			<description>&amp;quot;The Dig is a graphical adventure game developed by LucasArts and released in 1995, and a game based on the novel written by Alan Dean Foster. It was the 11th game to use the SCUMM game engine, and is famous for its connection to Steven Spielberg and notorious for its prolonged production that had the game bordering on vaporware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Released as CD-ROM only, The Dig was sold for PC and Macintosh computers. It contains a full voice-over soundtrack and a digital orchestral score. For the most part, the game's graphics are hand-drawn and sparsely animated, with a mixture of pre-rendered 3D and hand-drawn animation clips also presented in certain parts of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the most serious LucasArts adventure game, containing no slapstick, and relatively little subtle humor, an element found abundantly in all other LucasArts adventure titles. It is also the only one to fit perfectly into the science fiction genre.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The_Dig,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
