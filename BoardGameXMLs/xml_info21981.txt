			<description>&amp;quot;The only tennis strategy game that plays like the real thing!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tennis simulation game, with different boards, but similar mechanics, for playing singles and doubles. The game is played on a board with 81 boxes on each side of the net, grouped in 9 sections. When you play a shot, you call the section (1-9) that you are aiming at, and then roll 2 D6 to see which box in that area it lands in (1, 12 = fault, 2-11 - numbered sectors). If the box is next to a line, 2D6 are rolled to see if the ball is called out. Players can only play a shot if they can move to the ball to play it. The number of boxes that you can move depends on the type of shot played by your opponent (volley, power shot, lob), and where on the court you are. You also can move some boxes after your shot to set for the next one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules do not specify what length of game, etc., to play. Presumably you would decide to play a set, or a tiebreak, or whatever, and use tennis scoring to decide who won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
