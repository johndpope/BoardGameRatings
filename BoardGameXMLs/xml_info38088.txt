			<description>&amp;ldquo;Card game for 2 players. Each player is a Greater God trying to build up his pantheon.&amp;rdquo; The monsters, gods, and events appear to have been inspired by tales of mythology from various European countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card deck includes seven types of cards: Gods, Armies, Heroes, Priests, Monsters, Miracles, and Temples. Tokens are used to keep track of Worshipers. The players use their armies, heroes, and monsters, and priests to attack the opposing forces and temples. These actions may also result in the elimination or conversion of opposing Worshipers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to have seven or more God Cards in play on your side. God Cards are put into play by expending Faith Points. The Faith Points available to a player are determined each turn based on the number of Worshipers, Priests, and Temples controlled by the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
