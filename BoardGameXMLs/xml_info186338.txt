			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moon Wars attempts to adapt the Glorantha setting to West End Games' D6 System mechanics.  This is done through two primary methods--Character Templates and a Magic system.  Characters are build with 18 dice split into several Categories (Strength, Agility, Knowledge, Perception, Stealth, and Magic).  Each Category has several sub-categories, or Skills.  The basic template is personalized by spending an additional 7 dice among the Skills.  The document then presents about a dozen complete Character Templates which function somewhat like a class in a traditional RPG.  Each Template has an associated and completed HTML character sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While Cults are retained, their magic is not.  Instead, an open-ended magic system is proposed that allows a Cult to have spells &amp;quot;capable of doing anything within its own field.  For example Orlanth is a God of dreadful weather and warriors [so his Cult's spells] would cause winds and rain or make a better fighter&amp;quot;.  The document proposes twelve Cults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
