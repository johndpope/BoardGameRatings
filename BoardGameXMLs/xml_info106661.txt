			<description>Toy Story is a video game for the Sega Genesis, the Super Nintendo, Game Boy and Windows 95 PCs, developed by Traveller's Tales and released by Disney Interactive. It is largely based on the movie of the same name. The Japanese version of the game was distributed by Capcom internationally. The game closely follows the plot of Toy Story, with a few minor differences. The game was followed by a sequel based on the second film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control Woody through 17 stages (18 for the Genesis version) that encompass the entire plot of the film. Several obstacles lie between the player and the goal of each level, not least of which is a wide assortment of enemies. Woody is equipped with a pullstring whip, which will temporarily &amp;quot;tie up&amp;quot; opponents, letting Woody pass by unharmed. It cannot, however, kill enemies (with the lone exception of Nightmare Buzz, the only boss in the game to be permanently defeated through the whip). This whip can also latch onto certain hooks, letting Woody swing above perilous terrain (similar to Earthworm Jim and its whip mechanics).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game occasionally changes genres for a stage. Players control R.C. in two stages: one in which Woody knocks Buzz out a window, the other in which they both race back to the moving truck. Both play largely the same; the game takes an overhead view of the level, giving the players basic acceleration, braking and steering, and tasking players with reaching the end of the stage while not running out of batteries (which drain constantly, but can be replenished by bumping them out of Buzz in the former stage, and merely finding them on the ground in the latter). The Genesis version also has an exclusive level in which Woody rides R.C.'s back while rushing back to Sid's house to fetch Buzz; this stage plays very similar to OutRun, but has the same condition of maintaining a battery level. Lastly, one stage takes place in a first-person maze similar to Wolfenstein 3D, in which Woody must find alien squeak toys lost inside the claw machine and return them to the play area, where the rest of the alien toys reside, all within a time limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1&amp;ordm; - That Old Army Game&lt;br/&gt;2&amp;ordm; - Red Alert!&lt;br/&gt;3&amp;ordm; - Ego Check&lt;br/&gt;4&amp;ordm; - Nightmare Buzz&lt;br/&gt;5&amp;ordm; - A Buzz Clip&lt;br/&gt;6&amp;ordm; - Revenge of the Toys&lt;br/&gt;7&amp;ordm; - Run Rex, Run!&lt;br/&gt;8&amp;ordm; - Buzz Battle&lt;br/&gt;9&amp;ordm; - Food and Drink&lt;br/&gt;10&amp;ordm; - Inside the Claw Machine&lt;br/&gt;11&amp;ordm; - Really Inside the Claw Machine (not on the PC version)&lt;br/&gt;12&amp;ordm; - The Claw!&lt;br/&gt;13&amp;ordm; - Sid's Workbench&lt;br/&gt;14&amp;ordm; - Battle of the Mutant Toys&lt;br/&gt;15&amp;ordm; - Roller Bob&lt;br/&gt;16&amp;ordm; - Day-Toy-Na (only in the Sega Genesis and PC versions)&lt;br/&gt;17&amp;ordm; - Light My Fire (16&amp;ordm; in the SNES version)&lt;br/&gt;18&amp;deg; - Rocket Man (17&amp;ordm; in the SNES version)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Toy Story (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
