							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Baptism of Fire</name>
									
			<description>A WWII miniatures game with emphasis on realism.  From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;When I set about designing the rules, I had several ideas in mind. One was to provide a highly interactive game. The second was a degree of realism, not so much the detail of weapons, but more of the reactions and abilities of scared men led by a few less visibly scared. Lastly, it was to also take absolute control away from the player and provide uncertainty, have the men not always perform as well as desired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reprinted as Baptism of Fire II&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
