			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manreia did not suffer any battles within its borders during the Bane War, but the nation still suffered grievous losses. She sent many soldiers and vast stories of supplies to aid the Army of Light in its battles. Since the war ended and Manreia surrendered, she has had to struggle under the Witches' tyranny, living in a turmoil that even Manreian ingenuity cannot overcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Refugees who left Manreian camps often boarded ships that carried them to the islands of the Discordian Sea. Most met with disaster, but a few have managed to survive on one of the many islands. Their lives are little easier than the ones they left behind, but at least they are less likely to directly encounter banes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Science and Sea provides additional information about the nation of Manreia and life on the Discordian Sea within Accursed's setting of Morden. It includes a broad range of different adventure hooks for GMs and players looking to explore these specific regions. It also introduces new banes as well as Hindrances and Edges specific to these cultures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
