			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game is based on a TV show here in Estonia called &amp;quot;Unistuste Agnetuur&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Dream Agency&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;In it a story telling game in which each player must make a dream party for the customer.&lt;br/&gt;In each turn one player is a customer and all other players are dream party makers.&lt;br/&gt;Before customer takes a card from a theme deck, each player takes 1 card from 4 card piles (not the theme deck). On each of those card are 1 word. Now, the customer says the theme and each player now must put together a party idea for the customer using those 4 cards in their hand.&lt;br/&gt;After which, customer will decide who had the best idea and went close to what he / she wanted.&lt;br/&gt;Game goes on until everyone has been a customer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You win the game if you have collected the most theme cards while making the best parties. If two or more players have equal number of cards, then they must count flowers on them. Each flower is a point and a level of difficulty (1-easy, 3 hard).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
