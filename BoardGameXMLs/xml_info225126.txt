							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gwaeryn Keep</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gwaeryn is the seat of Clan Aeryn, one of the few Jarin clans that kept their lands when Ivinian vikings invaded northern H&amp;acirc;rn and established the Kingdom of Orbaal. Gwaeryn sits in the upper Anoth River valley, between the Jahl and Felsha mountains. The local terrain is hilly, wild, and heavily wooded. Like the rough landscape, the folks who live around Gwaeryn are rugged, enduring long winters and hard work to maintain what they have. A Jmorvi chantry lies hidden in the hills nearby. Few residents are aware of it, and Gwaeryn&amp;rsquo;s lord, Symael Aeryn, maintains its secrecy just as his ancestors have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gwaeryn Keep article describes the settlement's history, government, religion, and economics and provides information about Ilvir's Trail, one of the primary pilgrimage routes to Araka-Kalai, home to the god Ilvir. Details are given for some of the local craftsmen and other locations in the settlement. Includes a full description and color floor plans for the keep, along with color GM and player maps of the settlement. Also included are a 2-page description of Gwaeryn's inn, a 10-page description of the Jmorvi chantry (school of magic), and a 4-page description of the encampment for an Ilviran cult that has turned to human sacrifice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
