							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bard Variant: Sonic Destroyer</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sonic destroyer is a variant bard that focuses his efforts on using the power of his own voice for destructive purposes. Sonic destroyers learn sonic effects, rather than spells and songs. The original sonic destroyers were classically trained singers who took their vocal training in a more martial direction after their conservatory was overrun by fiends. Having already learned to shatter glass with their voices, it was just one more step to learn to shatter bodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
