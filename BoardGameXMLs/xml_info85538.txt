			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is said that a role-playing game is only as good as its Game Master. Now there is a book especially designed and dedicated to this principal performer. Expertly written by renowned Grand Master Gary Gygax, Master of the Game guides Game Masters of all role-playing games in how to achieve their highest degree of proficiency and skill. It then stimulates them even further to excellence beyond their campaign, if it's so desired. Here's the complete Game Master experience, including chapters on:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Preparing for the Principal Role&lt;br/&gt;- The Master Milieu: Design and Maintenance&lt;br/&gt;- Mastery and Modification of the Rules and Systems&lt;br/&gt;- How to Master the Adventure Scenario&lt;br/&gt;- Why a Campaign Fails&lt;br/&gt;- How to Establish and Manage an RPG Convention&lt;br/&gt;- How to Create Your Own RPG Publication&lt;br/&gt;- How to Assist Others toward Master Game Mastering&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For present and aspiring Game Masters, Master of the Game is the long-awaited companion to Gary Gygax's previous successful book, Role Playing Mastery. It's a guide no Game Master should be without.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
