							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Escape: Zombie City – Queenie 2</name>
									
			<description>This queenie has 2 alternate zombies, a street tile and eight new item tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two new zombies, Hammer-Zombie and Combi-Zombi, are tough and will each take multiple players to defeat (respectively 7 fists and 3 fists + 3 bats).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new street tile is &amp;quot;the shack&amp;quot; which can be used as a safe house for one player who can not make it back to the church.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new items give the player actions they can perform, but they can not be stored in the van:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     flashlight: explore an empty location and take a new item. Discard the flashlight.&lt;br/&gt;     defibrilator: as long as the player is carrying the defbrillator, one calm face heals every panic face (this helps all players sharing a tile with its owner)&lt;br/&gt;     crossbow: counts as a fist or a bat whenever you fight a zombie&lt;br/&gt;     map: allows a player to move to any tile with 2 runner icons (even traveling through buildings to get there)&lt;br/&gt;     backpack (3x): allows the player to carry 2 more items&lt;br/&gt;     kevlar vest: players can use their calm faces when zombies are on the same tile as the player&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
