			<description>Players compete to purchase vineyards along the Italian peninsula.&lt;br/&gt;By exploiting their own lands, they will produce wine with which they will realize the revenue necessary to develop their own activities.&lt;br/&gt;Who will become the most famous?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in 6 turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn is divided into 3 phases:  &lt;br/&gt;1.    The arrangement of the turn&lt;br/&gt;2.    The choice of actions&lt;br/&gt;3.    The development of actions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The arrangement of the turn&lt;br/&gt;Put 6 land cards on the table: get the first 4 from the stacks corresponding to the specific grape varieties. &lt;br/&gt;Get the last 2 from the shared deck. These will be the lands that can be purchased in the turn.&lt;br/&gt;For the successive turns, update the prices increasing the highest price to 7 and use the same gap for all other prices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The choice of actions&lt;br/&gt;Every player starting from the first will be able to do some actions. There is only one limit to the actions that can be done in a turn: that is the money necessary to do them.&lt;br/&gt;These actions, that can be found on the corresponding table of the game board, are:  &lt;br/&gt;Modify the game order for the next turn    &lt;br/&gt;Turn a land into a DOCG area (where DOCG stays for &amp;ldquo;Denomination of origin inspected and guaranteed&amp;rdquo;)&lt;br/&gt;Benefit from the events&lt;br/&gt;Purchase the lands revealed on the turn&lt;br/&gt;Develop your own production capacity (quantity)&lt;br/&gt;Develop your general productive quality&lt;br/&gt;Make one of your vineyards productive    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of actions&lt;br/&gt;All the actions choosed before will be acted in the game, in the exact order of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End of the game&lt;br/&gt;The game ends at the end of the sixth turn.&lt;br/&gt;In the last turn some bonus fame points will be distributed. &lt;br/&gt;More specifically: fame points to the player who has got more points on the bonus vine production, fame points to the player who has got more lands for each of the 4 macro-areas, fame points to the player with more money, fame point for each line of the technological development equal to 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is who has got more fame points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
