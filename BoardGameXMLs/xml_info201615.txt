							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">And I Lost My Fangs</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting is a support group meeting for vampires who&amp;rsquo;ve all lost their fangs in one way or another. The group is called FA &amp;ndash; Fangless Anonymous and this is their very first meeting, so nobody really knows each other yet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take the roles of fangless vampires while the game master will take the role of the therapist. All the vampires are sad, angry and worried about having lost this otherwise very essential part of them, and everyone&amp;rsquo;s sitting with a feeling of having lost that one thing that makes them who they are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The document includes two page sizes (A4 and A5) which may complicate printing.  The game has the same English title in both the English- and Danish-language versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
