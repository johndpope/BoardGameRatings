			<description>The game of random thinking! What crazy ideas fly out of your mouth when you're trying to make connections under pressure? Whatever they are. Randomonium will keep you and your friends laughing. Try to make as many connection between tiles as you can before the timer runs out. On your turn you have 20 seconds to link the words on your tiles to the tiles already played. You can be creative as you like, but your fellow players will decide if you play counts or not. Fast-paced and perfect for a crowd, Randomonium will put a smile on your face. Free association has never been so much fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
