			<description>Party game that comes in two parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First is a simple word game. Each player gets a card headed with What is the Female Name for each of the following words.&lt;br/&gt;First to get all correct, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second game is another word game. This time the host puts around the room cards that ale all identical (thus to cut down over-crowding around just one card). On each card there is a little story and hidden within the story are items associated with a dressmaker. This is a considerably harder game than the first one. The first player to return with the most correct answers, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
