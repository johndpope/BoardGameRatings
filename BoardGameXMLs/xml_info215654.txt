			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War in the Sea, Sky, and Beyond!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate War (5E) takes mass combat far beyond the battlefield! This incredible accessory for 5th Edition campaigns builds on the basic kingdom-building and warfare rules in Kingdoms (5E) and expanded further in Ultimate Rulership (5E) and Ultimate Battle (5E), providing a richly immersive but still abstract integrated system for taking your traditional land battles into the skies above, across the seas beyond, and under the waves into the ocean depths without having to change systems. You'll find dozens of new vehicles, from traditional naval vessels like galleys and longships to ironclads and submersibles, alongside fantastic aerial vehicles from flying carpets and drogue wings to war rockets and solar sailers, with an array of specialized tactics and rules for dogfighting, ramming, strafing runs, flak, and more! We also bring you a ton of great material for siege warfare, including magical siege weapons and siege tactics from blockade to escalade! You'll also get exciting new command boons like cornucopia, surgical strike, and falling dusk, and a elegant new system of modular unit construction and interaction, allowing you to design combined arms units capable of a little bit of everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're using the base rules in Kingdoms or the advanced kingdom and warfare options in Ultimate Rulership or Ultimate Battle, your heroes can stake their claim to power in the campaign world, daring anyone to stand against the forces they command! In addition, we provide detailed record sheets for your domain and your military! Grab this fantastic 44-page 5E supplement today and Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
