			<description>This game is played with a standard deck of cards. There are different partnering arrangements in each deal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tricks are played, and then the player's score is the number of tricks won multiplied by the number won by his partner. (There are some deals with different scoring rules).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner at the end is the player with the second highest score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
