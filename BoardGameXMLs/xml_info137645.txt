			<description>It's a game directed mainly at children where they roll a die to move on the track and draw special cards. It's a kind of trivia race, but there is no finishing line - the game ends when one particular card is drawn (&amp;quot;Matołek the Billy-Goat&amp;quot; - a character from popular Polish comic books for children). During the game you have the opportunity to test your knowledge about Świętokrzyskie Province, to become acquainted with legends and famous sites from this area and to collect &amp;quot;emeryks&amp;quot; (which is the goal of the game). But you have to be careful of a highwayman called Madej and his clubs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;A board game about the attractions of Świętokrzyskie Province.&lt;br/&gt;The game Zaczarowana Kraina provides you with lots of excitement and healthy competition among family and friends at the same time getting you to know the beauty of nature, cultural wealth and fascinating past of Świętokrzyskie Province. The game encourages you also to visit some or all of presented sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
