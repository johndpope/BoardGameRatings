			<description>Matt Gregory is the creator and  owner of DRNK Games Llc. &amp;quot;I have a passion for board, card and video games; as well as anything related to beer. Drinkuisition is a great game that I want to share with like minded friends.&amp;quot; Is a direct quote from the &amp;quot;Meet The Gang&amp;quot; page of drnkgames.com Drinkuisition is a trivia, drinking, party card game and it just so happens to utilize all three learning styles. This helps the players retain the information despite consuming alcohol. Drinkuisition is chock full of fun, interesting, questions which include fun facts or optional bonus questions on each card. These questions are ones that most people should know. However, most players quickly find that they have trouble recalling the answer when put on the spot. Unlike other party, card, games, Drinkuisition is the only trivia, drinking, game available. Most questions will leave the player thinking &amp;quot;Oh, I know this but I can't think of the answer.&amp;quot; We all know that feeling and it is common to have players who feel that way, which makes for a very INTERESTING game. The penalty and reward system is enforced by giving out drinks for incorrect answers (with a few surprises of course). For more information on Drinkuisition follow drnkgames on Instagram and Facebook and subscribe to our E-Mail list for updates on a, possible, upcoming kickstarter campaign at drnkgames.com; where you can also download and make your own copy of Drinkuisition. We'll also let you know when we have Drinkuisition for sale. When the beer (or wine, cider, cocktails etc.) starts flowing, players begin to laugh with each other and poke fun at one another. Before you know it, you'll be laughing and playing for hours. If you're a fan of other party based card games, or trivia night at your local pub, then you'll be sure to love Drinkuisition. You'll be glad you picked up a copy and your friends will be glad you did too. Cheers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME PLAY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY INSTRUCIONAL VIDEOS ARE AVAILABLE AT DRNKGAMES.COM&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay uses 3 individual decks, the main deck (play deck), trivia questions deck and common knowledge questions deck. Each player will draw the top card from the main deck and follow the instructions on said card. If you are directed to answer a trivia or common knowledge questions then the player to your left will draw the top card from the corresponding deck and ask the question. There is, either, a fun fact or optional bonus question on every card. If a player answers a question correctly, they will keep the card. If a player answers a question incorrectly, the player will &amp;quot;take a drink&amp;quot;. The player at the end of each round with the most question cards in their hand is the winner and will start the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAYERS &amp;amp; TIME:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drinkuisition is playable from 2-6 players, with an even amount of cards per player. However, it is possible to play with up to 8 players if your group doesn't mind a few people having one extra turn in any given round. A typical round should last anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the amount of side chatter, joking around, etc. (which does usually happen)At the end of the round, simply shuffle the main deck and add the used questions cards to the bottom of their corresponding piles. Then you're ready to play again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
