			<description>The Ancients who built the Labyrinth millennia ago&lt;br/&gt;Used a race of Saurians, whom they created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strong, manlike lizards were their favorites.&lt;br/&gt;They fascinated, amused and surprised the Ancients with their cleverness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saurians worshipped the Ancients as their gods,&lt;br/&gt;While the Ancients had devised grand plans for their children.&lt;br/&gt;They did what they could to develop and educate them&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;But they failed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite their cunning, Saurians remained savage.&lt;br/&gt;They kept fighting unending bloody wars,&lt;br/&gt;Wars of domination among themselves.&lt;br/&gt;When Saurians were close to extinction, the Ancients chose to keep in the memory of time&lt;br/&gt;A recollection, however fleeting, about their children. Nothing else could be done for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From that moment, Saurians have been kept alive by the Power of the Ancients.&lt;br/&gt;They guard their magic buildings and majestic portals.&lt;br/&gt;They do what they have always done best - fight any enemies&lt;br/&gt;Who wish to wrest long-buried, holy secrets from the depths of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What can you expect from this expansion?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Efficient hunters prowling the Labyrinth with inhuman speed!&lt;br/&gt;     Predatory warriors that aid each other and poison their game!&lt;br/&gt;     The Ancients&amp;rsquo; Chosen able to come back to life from the underworld!&lt;br/&gt;     Cunning lizardmen who steal keys and magic items!&lt;br/&gt;     Monsters immune to the Golem, traps, magic of the Ancients and events!&lt;br/&gt;     IMPORTANT: Any player may move Saurians once per turn by spending 1 action!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
