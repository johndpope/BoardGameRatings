			<description>Antonine! The Battle for Caledonia is a game where the Picts and the Romans go Head to Head fighting to either gain control 4 of the Antonine Wall Forts or to capture 4 of the opponents pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 13 by 13 board which represents the area around the Antonine Wall between the Fort at New Kilpatrick and the Fort at Kinneil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game play is via die roll. Players roll 1d6 and 1d4. The result is the number of squares you may move in two different directions but not diagonally. If you land exactly on an opponents piece it is captured and is taken to one of your own camps where it stays unless released by an opponents counter landing on the camp it is trapped in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can capture a fort in the same manner. If it is occupied by an opponents piece that too would be captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fun little game which can be challenging and frustrating as you must use your exact die rolls and you must move! Can get tricky in the latter stages of the game! A good move and capture game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Board&lt;br/&gt;6 Roman Soldiers&lt;br/&gt;6 Pict Warriors&lt;br/&gt;1 D4&lt;br/&gt;1 D6&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
