			<description>Welcome to the FarWest!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game each player will assume the role of a Deputy and they will try to help the Sheriff to deal with all of the Farwest troubles.&lt;br/&gt;The Sheriff, qill be moved by one of the players around the city, and its surroundings. Each player will colect Rumors (cards in hand) so they can make a row of Suspects (cards in game) for each complete Row of suspects (5 cards) the players will try to score as many points they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a scoring similar to Poker, players will have to combine the different Rumors into actual suspects and deliver them to the Sheriff, or use them to get rid of the Big Bad Guys that will arrive in the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will have to place their Deputy (player token) in one of the places in the board (city, surroundings, and far away) and execute the action that it allows them to do. At the end of the turn (every player have done his action) players are allowed to place rumors into play (to become suspects) accordling to the place and action he chooses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time 2 or more Deputys chooses the same place they will have to duel for the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To impress the Sheriff and the Farwest Community, the Deputy must not achieve the lowest score in any of the solved problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To help the deputy in his duty, there will be special people (special cards) that can lend a hand in fighting the crime!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the 3rd Big Bad Ugly Guy is eliminated the game is over, and the Sheriff will nominate only one sucessor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
