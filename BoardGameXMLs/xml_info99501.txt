							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deathtrap Raider</name>
									
			<description>From the Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sky exploded as a portal opened. By finding the ancient spell book of Analand, Mara has learned how to use ZED and teleport. She is visiting old Allansia, the Chiang Mai area. A helicopter comes down through the portal and hovers there over the mounds of snow before landing. Snow is whirled and blown everywhere because of the propellers. Mara gets out dressed in her tight thermal suit and furry-collared trench coat. With her rucksack of equipment, she leaves from the chopper and hikes it down the mountain pass as her rides returns to the teleport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She arrives at the doors of the death-trap Dungeon and inserts a diamond into the lock, locks click in succession, and the doors open. What comes out is cold stale air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lighting her large glow stick she sets foot inside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dull crystals light up and give off a dull light just enough for her to see a bit down the Northern tunnel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mission is to attain a blue diamond rumoured to be in the cavern of the Dungeon. She plans on stealing it, returning to her time and auctioning it off to the modern world. Although she has travelled back in time, the dangers are still real in this present time. She has arrived long after the Trial of Champions number 4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
