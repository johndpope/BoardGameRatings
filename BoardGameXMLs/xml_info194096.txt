							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Breaker</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The electric chair was just the beginning&amp;hellip; Breaker!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level 12 Rogue, Breaker is an iconic character in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration. A prison escapee with nothing left to lose, he&amp;rsquo;s ready to use his mastery over electricity to stake his claim in the roughest part of town!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breaker's file is designated &amp;ldquo;Red&amp;rdquo; to indicate the innate mastery of electricity that makes him so formidable. Once thought of as the toughest man in his cell block, now he&amp;rsquo;s the most wanted man in Beacon City. Never willing to back down, and always ready to prove how tough he is, Breaker is very confrontational and very dangerous. He&amp;rsquo;s a man who has always used fear and intimidation to get what he wants, and now he&amp;rsquo;s nearly untouchable thanks to his newly-discovered ability to charge his body with massive pulses of electricity. The perfect villain for a hero who wants to keep the streets &amp;lsquo;clean&amp;rsquo; of criminals, he&amp;rsquo;s also a challenge for any hero who relies on melee tactics to overcome their foes. With a mean streak a mile wide, Breaker also holds grudges with a passion, and will not hesitate to track down any hero who manages to defeat him in front of others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
