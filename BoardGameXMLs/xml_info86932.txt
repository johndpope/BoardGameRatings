			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Purchase DC = $$$&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within these pages, every item in the Modern SRD has had its value translated into real dollars. Every Firearm and Vehicle has an actual list price. Want to craft an item using your own skill? The average cost for components based on the difficulty of crafting the item are listed. &lt;br/&gt;All services and lifestyle items have been given real prices as well. Furthermore, a method for determining starting wealth for characters of 1st through 20th level has been included. You've wished for it! Now it is here for the downloading!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have embraced the d20 Modern Roleplaying Game, but you miss the excitement of purchasing your own equipment with money you can count, now you can!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
