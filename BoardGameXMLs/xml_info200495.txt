			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Davae Breon Jaxon's Cinematic Environs continues this new series of suppliments designed to help GMs paint vivid cinematic scenes for their players in a way that gives the environment its own unique character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These environs can take a mundane encounter or location and turn it into an epic scene that the players will be talking about for year to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fourth in the series deals with Aerial Environs. It discusses the effects of of things like altitude and falling, but also includes material related to aerial combat, chases, arcane hazards, sky pirates, new materials, and various modes of aerial transportation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, instead of simply sending the party on an adventure to find a lost tomb, the GM can have the tomb located on a floating skyland (sky island). Instead of bandits along the road, the party now has to be on the lookout for death from above as wyvern-riding kobold pirates descend upon their aetherwood ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also incuded is a new character background, new equipment, new weapons, new vehicles, new materials and a new magic items related to this particular environ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
