			<description>Kyllingjakten is a children's game with an interesting use of magnets. The players move a hen around the board to try to find her missing chickens. When the hen reaches designated places, the player moves them next to the nearby chicken to see if they attract each other. If they do, they belong together, and the player must bring the chicken back to the hen house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hens and the chickens have plastic feet with magnets of both orientations, so that each chicken belongs to exactly two hens. With two players, one should use two hens of opposite orientations, and with three players, the game is very unbalanced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: Game board, die, hens and chickens, magnetic plastic feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
