							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lust in Skew Hollow</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ducal Orb is found! But the Duke..?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Does this noble of ancient lineage ride the Wasted Glades while a common captain rules the Tower? Aye...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They call the Duke 'the Heartless', prince fallen to lust; the Schemer stole that heart and keeps it still: in a jar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But now the Tower calls the willing...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lust in Skew Hollow is an adventure with five locations, a map and a set of protagonists, all folding into a pocket format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The elements weave into a quest for a failing realm on a lonely coast, offering wily adventurers access to powerful figures, an altered people and a source of fuel, as well as knowledge of nefarious scheming. The material is suitable for rules-light gaming and designed for easy adaptation to various settings and systems, describing the key elements with a degree of uncertainty in terms open to interpretation. It assumes that dice are used for random numbers, but also offers a diceless number generator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The package includes a copy of isophasmic light, a compact approach to gaming used in the creation of the profiles. As with isophasmic light, the adventure is laid out for use as a PolyP booklet, to make it easier to play spontaneously and on the move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
