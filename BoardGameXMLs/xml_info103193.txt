			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cell Bound is a matching puzzle game set in a Petri Dish.  The goal is to keep the cells from overwhelming the dish.  This is accomplished by matching five or more cells of the same color to eliminate them.  If things get to out of control you can use a bomb to clear out the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three modes included with the game:&lt;br/&gt;Infinite Mode - Main mode as described above.&lt;br/&gt;Timer Mode -  Try to score as many points in one minute and thirty seconds.&lt;br/&gt;Burst Mode - For an additional challenge cells turn black if they are not the same color as those they are next to making them unable to react.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
