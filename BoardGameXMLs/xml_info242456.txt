							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Investigator</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expanded Professions: The Investigator Plunges into the Savage Unknown&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is designed to expand upon the premise of a single Professional Edge representing a an entire profession&amp;rsquo;s career path by creating a tree of Edges from that base profession, allowing for a more direct concept and development focus as the character progresses while still allowing for adaptability and wide variation by accommodating unrelated Edges. These so-called &amp;ldquo;profession trees&amp;rdquo; represent a shared vision and likely direction of advancement in both career and purpose that may be enjoyed by the sort of hero who would pursue the indicated occupation beyond the rudiments of the initial Professional Edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this offering, you&amp;rsquo;ll find the investigator profession tree. These brave souls are determined to find and follow clues, no matter where they may lead&amp;mdash;even beyond the ken of mortal man. They are hardened against terror and ignorance alike, destined to seek the truth no matter the cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
