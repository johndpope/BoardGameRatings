			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you have the original 22 Talent Trees, but still you need more options for your d20 Modern heroes? Do you wish your Fast heroes could strike with Critical Precision? Does your Tough hero need thicker skin? What if your Dedicated hero was devoted to mastering a weapon?   &lt;br/&gt;Another 22 Talent Trees presents dozens of new talents (grouped into 22 trees) for the core classes. With this supplement you can play a Strong hero and use the Tackle and Grip of Iron talents to break your puny opponents in half! You can also enjoy the speed of the Fast hero with the Lightning Fists talent tree. Or perhaps you would prefer the Tough hero, with hardened flesh and a punishing Battle Endurance. If you prefer a little magic in your modern games, you might enjoy the Arcane Secrets talent tree, designed for the Smart hero. With these mystical talents, the Smart hero can gain all sorts of special abilities including bonus spells. The Dedicated hero, devoted to the mastery of a single weapon, is also a formidable character. Just imagine your hero brandishing his beloved Weapon of Choice and blasting his enemies! Dedicated heroes can also choose talents from the Zen Talent Tree and become One with the Universe. Of course we can't forget about the Charismatic hero and his terrifying showmanship when he uses the Grand Weapon Display talent!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These and dozens of other innovative ideas fill the pages of this supplement!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BUT WAIT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THERE'S MORE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another 22 Talent Trees also features four new martial arts feats including the devastating One Ton Kick and the fiendish Devil's Finger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You get all this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dozens of talents grouped into 22 Talent Trees&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four new martial arts feats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7 stunning images depicting the talents and feats in action&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
