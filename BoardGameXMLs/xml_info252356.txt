			<description>Battle for the Ball is an original two-player sports board game simulating a soccer or international football match.  Playing on an 11&amp;times;16 hex map of a classic football pitch, two teams with 10 player pieces on each side compete to control the ball, pass to forward players, tackle to control the ball, and advance to a position to make a goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses dice, player pieces, and cards to control the action. There are no springs or finger-flicking in this game; the rules, based on the 17 laws of soccer, the map, the cards and dice rolls determine success on the field and glory in the stands.  Each player side has two key phases: the initiative phase in which the side with a high die roll spends momentum points to move, pass, tackle, and score; and a teamwork phase in which the whole team moves, enabling the game to reproduce the flow and movement of the Beautiful Game.  Special cards may give special opportunities: a burst of speed or a cannonball kick; the hand of fate or owner interference... Ready your formation, lead your players to victory, and battle for the ball!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
