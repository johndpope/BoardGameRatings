			<description>Traditional Dutch card game, with quite some similarities to the tile game Rummikub. It is an easy family game with 104 playing cards and 4 jokers. It can be played at home but also with larger groups in competitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the game is to get rid of as many cards as possible, since they mean penalty points. You can get rid of cards by forming sets or rows. These are placed openly on the table. Jokers can represent any card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player that gets rid of all his cards first is the winner. The others get penalty points for the cards that are still in their hand. After 10 games the total score is calculated - the player with the least points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
