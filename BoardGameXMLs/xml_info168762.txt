							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Green Fairy</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paris at the end of the 19th century: a city of lights, music, excitement at the approach of the new century and aflame with the creative spirit of the Bohemian revolution. But for months the city has been locked in a state of fear as the brutal murderer known as the Raptor stalks the steep streets and narrow alleyways of the north-end hill neighborhood of  Montmartre. Many refuse to leave their homes by night. Others frequent establishments such as &amp;ldquo;The Green Fairy,&amp;rdquo; an absinthe bar and popular meeting place for artists, actors, whores, criminals, and the well-to-do seeking to taste the thrills and pleasures of Montmartre. This evening, the patrons of &amp;ldquo;The Green Fairy&amp;rdquo; will be joined by a visitor beyond their darkest nightmares. The Green Fairy is a game script for Cthulhu Live 3rd Edition. The text contains the game overview and timeline, staging and prop guidelines, and detailed character sheets and backgrounds for 30 player characters! Ideal as an event for a Live Action Role-Playing (LARP) party with friends or as a convention event, it offers hours of fun, intrigue, and horror. This scenario requires the Cthulhu Live 3rd Edition game rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This download includes three different variants of the game script &amp;mdash; color, black-and-white, and background-free &amp;mdash; and each of these comes in low-resolution screen-friendly and high-resolution printer-friendly versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
