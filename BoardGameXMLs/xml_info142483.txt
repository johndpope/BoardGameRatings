			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hunter held his breath as the deer approached&amp;mdash;a mother and its young. Silently, slowly, he drew back an arrow and aimed down its slender shaft. He had hoped for a buck, but was too hungry to be picky. Suddenly, his bow and arrow burst into flame, burning his ungloved hands. At first he was too stunned to notice that his clothes and his quiver of arrows were also ablaze, but the pain quickly caught his attention. In a moment he stood naked except for his leather tunic and huntsman&amp;rsquo;s knife belted at the side. Then he noticed the druid standing beneath a nearby oak, wagging an accusing finger in his direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
