							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GURPS Alphabet Arcane: Lost Serifs</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite running the gamut from A to Z, GURPS Alphabet Arcane couldn't confine all its wonders to one supplement. Fortunately, there's GURPS Alphabet Arcane: Lost Serifs to provide some additional illumination from Stefan Jones (author of GURPS Uplift and MacGuffin Alphabet).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secrets revealed herein include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Expanded information on Condor Boy, a young hero who plays an important part for many of the artifacts from GURPS Alphabet Arcane.&lt;br/&gt;     A description of the fallen paradise that serves as the otherworldly realm where some ancient entities reside between visits to our world.&lt;br/&gt;     An alternate version of the Fabulous Pavilion that recasts that dreamland party as an actual pocket universe!&lt;br/&gt;     Additional material that helps to introduce several items; use as scripts or sources of inspiration for incorporating those items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you've already visited the world of GURPS Alphabet Arcane, these pages can help add depth and variations to its items; if you aren't yet familiar with that supplement's charms, GURPS Alphabet Arcane: Lost Serifs is an excellent (and affordable!) introduction. Regardless of how well you know the alphabet, you're bound to learn something new!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
