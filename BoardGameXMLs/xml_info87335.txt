			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Council ruling the planet Xul 3 has a problem: while conducting a routine observation mission on the planet Kef, their spies have discovered a plot by the Kef leaders to attack several other worlds, including Xul 3. Kef, second planet of the Betelgeuse system, is inhabited by two races, the disciplined and organized Stiffiens and the anarchic, peace-loving Swapis and has always stayed outside galactic affairs. But since a series of natural catastrophes a few months ago, a religion called the Cult of Antin&amp;egrave;s has spread among the Stiffiens. The cult revolves around a mysterious building, Antin&amp;egrave;s, located high in the Kef mountains, that nobody has ever been able to enter. The Council is concerned by the threats of war and the spread of the new religion and they decide to send Crafton and his alien sidekick Xunk to investigate and try to discover the secrets of Antin&amp;egrave;s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get Dexter 2 uses the same engine as the previous game. The display uses isometric 3D. The player controls Crafton using the keyboard or the joystick, exploring Kef, picking up objects, dodging dangerous animals, plants or robots and searching for clues. The player can swap items with swapis, and must build up trust with the locals (represented by a percentage value on the screen) before being allowed to some places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get Dexter 2 was developed by Remi Herbulot, with graphics by Michel Rho.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
