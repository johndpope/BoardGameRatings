							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The War to Prevent Southern Secession</name>
									
			<description>This light, 2-player game takes place during the latter part of the American War Between the States (1861-1865), initiated by the North (USA) after the South (CSA) peacefully seceded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map has nine areas where battles will take place. Players have a hand of cards and, generally, will place some cards before a battle begins and then others which can only be played after a battle begins. There is a small element of bluff during battle setup, but hand management is key, as well as knowing when to &amp;quot;hold 'em or fold 'em.&amp;quot; An asymmetric card deck will encourage the USA player to make use of his men and materiel advantages, while the CSA player must husband his resources and pick his spots carefully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends immediately when the USA player wins six battle areas (total victory is inevitable) or the CSA player wins four areas (the war drags on and the North tires of it).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
