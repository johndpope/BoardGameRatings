			<description>Reiselyst combines trivia with strategy and family games. The players travel through Europe, picking up passengers on their route and test their knowledge in geography, language and culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The handicap system&lt;br/&gt;Choose a level, 1, 2 or 3 - easy, medium or difficult.&lt;br/&gt;With its unique handicap system Reiselyst regards the players level of knowledge. The 12 year old may play against the grown ups on equal terms and the not-so-well-traveled may challenge the globetrotter in a duel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategy and duel&lt;br/&gt;The surprises of the game make the player's choice of route and strategy as important as the knowledge. It is not obvious that the most knowledgeable wins the game. During the game the players may challenge each other in a duel. The one who loses the duel, suffer the same fate as Napoleon and is sent to Elba...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Translated from the box, in Norwegian)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
