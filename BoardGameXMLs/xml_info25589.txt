			<description>A.C.R.O.N.Y.M.I.A = A Creative Response Only Needs Your Most Inventive Acronym. The name says it all - a great new Australian designed game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the Game:&lt;br/&gt;To be the player with the highest score at the end of Round 10, after adding the scores of each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the Game:&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the Word Cards and create a face down pile.&lt;br/&gt;Write the names of each player on the score pad and commence play in your chosen order.&lt;br/&gt;On a players turn, he/she picks up a Word Card from the pile. This card contains a Word of between 4 to 7 letters. The timer is started and the player has 30 seconds to make a sentence using each of the letters in the Word (in order). [This is an ACRONYM]&lt;br/&gt;No time for giggling... gotta get creative!&lt;br/&gt;eg. DISCO could be &amp;quot;Dancing In Silly Clothes Overnight&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;eg. TIME could be &amp;quot;Time Is My Enemy&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After everyone stops laughing, each other player holds up a Score Card to show their judgment of the creativity / humor / inventiveness, etc.&lt;br/&gt;Each players Score Card value is added together and multiplied by the Word Card Value to reach a Score for that round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Rounds 4 &amp;amp; 7 are Bonus Rounds. After the score has been calculated, the player rolls the dice and multiplies his/her score x the dice number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
