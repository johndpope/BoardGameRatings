			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes (characters) have eight Attributes:  Quickness, Dexterity, Endurance, Strength, Reason, Perception, Willpower, and Charisma.  Each Attribute has a numeric rating of 1-9, with 5 being a &amp;quot;heroic&amp;quot; human average.  Each Attribute also has a letter code (A, B, C, D, or X) which indicates the amount of training in the Attribute.  Ability Codes are compared to an Action Table to determine possible actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actions are resolved by playing cards from a hand.  The Narrator (game master) will determine the Attribute used for an action as well as the Action Difficulty.  The player then plays a card to determine success.  Several rules govern card play.  After the action is resolved the player draws new cards to a full hand.  Combat is handled in a similar way but with more complication and options.  Occasional Fate Cards provide for special actions during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
