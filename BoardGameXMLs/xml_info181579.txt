			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contradiction is a unique adventure / murder mystery game that uses live-action video for the entirety of the game play. It&amp;rsquo;s a brand new take on the concept of an interactive movie and brings the genre to a whole new level of playability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fictional village of Edenton is shown from various points around the high street and surrounding woodland. You&amp;rsquo;re free to wander around as Jenks throughout the game. When there&amp;rsquo;s something interesting to find or see, Jenks can pick it up or make a note of it. You can often use collected objects at other locations, such as using a key to open a door.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While on your travels you meet several characters living in the village. When Jenks knocks on their door, they let him in and you can then decide what Jenks asks them. You can ask about any object or note. They will answer your question, then a summary of their reply will be shown. Now all you have to do is spot the contradictions in what they&amp;rsquo;ve said - pair two contradictory statements and the character will be forced to admit their lie, advancing the story by opening up new places to explore, events to witness and characters to interview.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
