							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ptolus: The World of Praemal</name>
									
			<description>The material in this book corresponds directly to Chapters 2&amp;ndash;5 in Ptolus: Monte Cook's City by the Spire, when this large book was published in PDF form it was split into nine parts that were released and sold separately. The PDF   versions have new covers, and notes  and page numbering relating to being split up from the hardcover book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;Ptolus is an exciting city, but in order to truly understand the place, one has to understand its context, both in relation to the world around it and to the events that have come before now&amp;mdash;even those that occurred before the city existed.&lt;br/&gt;This book contains a wealth of detail to establish the background of Ptolus. You&amp;rsquo;ll learn about the world of Praemal: the lands around Ptolus, the languages spoken there, and more. You&amp;rsquo;ll discover new facts about the races of the Ptolus Campaign. You&amp;rsquo;ll read about the creation of the world and its relationship to other worlds and planes, as well as about the various gods&amp;mdash;especially the most popular, the god Lothian. And finally, you&amp;rsquo;ll delve deeply into the&lt;br/&gt;ten-thousand-year history of Praemal, discovering many amazing and significant events.&lt;br/&gt;This is one in a series of nine Ptolus PDF releases from Malhavoc Press. When used together, they comprise the entirety of the Ptolus print book.&lt;br/&gt;Each one is also usable on its own for city-based fantasy d20 roleplaying campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
