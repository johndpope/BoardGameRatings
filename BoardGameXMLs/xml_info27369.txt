			<description>Living Earth Games is a now defunct game company that made ecologically aware games printed in 100% recycled materials. The company appears to have been on the web until 2004.  The following information was on their website concerning Living Landscapes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At each stage of their growth, plants like to have good soil, good air, the right water, and sun to thrive. In seven stages of the life cycle of this pea plant, the players bring together these four elements for steady growth, laying pieces in the outer puzzle when rolling the special figure die. Meanwhile, the wildlife in and around the garden can be a help or a threat: does the beetle eat the snail, sparing the pea plant; does the dove find enough grains or eat the peas?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Makes plant demands and growth easily understandable for toddlers and bigger children. Also for teens and adults in teaching situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
