			<description>One of the first formal &amp;quot;Trivia&amp;quot; games of the late 1800's  Very ornate wood box with numerous cards with questions covering several different topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game reflects the heavy religious sentiment of the era and has a unique mechanism for gameplay.  Each question is assigned two letters.  The letters are matched up on the spinning cylinder within the box and are given a corresponding 2 digit number.  The number is located on the question card and that reveals the answer!  This appears to be one of the first games where expansion sets were available as well.  A player could purchase additional question cards for $0.05 each or $0.50 for a dozen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;W.S. Reed Toy Company was located in Leominster, Massachusetts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
