			<description>Whether you specialise in grain, fruits or even maintaining your own dairy farm, in Farming World you have the ultimate choice on how you shape your business. With dozens of seed types to choose from and an extensive stock market listing, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to adapt to become profitable.

In this PC farming simulator  game, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to expand your farm&amp;rsquo;s reaches across the map. Land can be purchased if you&amp;rsquo;re wealthy enough but for those with a limited budget you might be better off renting the it until you can afford to own your entire farm. As you obtain more fields to work in, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to construct roads which allow your vehicles to navigate to the correct patch of land so they can harvest and maintain the fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to maintain your farm you&amp;rsquo;ll need to construct a selection of buildings from a selection of over 40 to including; greenhouses, bakeries and butcheries . You&amp;rsquo;ll also be able to purchase animals from the traditional chickens and cows to the more unconventional domestic turkeys and ostriches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features of Excalibur&amp;rsquo;s Farming World:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Develop road networks for your vehicles to use&lt;br/&gt;     Purchase and rent land&lt;br/&gt;     Over 30 different types of seeds to plant&lt;br/&gt;     Over 40 building types&lt;br/&gt;     12 Different animals to purchase&lt;br/&gt;     Take on contracts to earn more money&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed weather reports&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
