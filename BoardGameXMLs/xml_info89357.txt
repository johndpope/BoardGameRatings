			<description>Time to get those dogies movin' with this simple dice game. Played with only four dice, your objective is to move the herd from the ranch to the final destination 500 miles away. Along the way you may get slowed down by grazing cattle, runaways, and stampedes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a western cattle drive theme and involves 4 custom dice consisting of the following icons, Stampede, Grazing, Runaway, Lasso, 1, 2, 3. Basically the object of the game is to be the first player to travel 500 miles (50 spaces).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During Each Turn the player rolls the dice up to 3 turns. On the first roll they keep 2 die for the final tally, on the second roll they keep 1 die, and the final roll they keep the final die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Breakdown of the rolls,&lt;br/&gt;If a stampede is rolled, those die MUST be held no matter how many are rolled.&lt;br/&gt;If a grazing is rolled, those die MUST be held, but only up to the number of die that are to be kept for that round.&lt;br/&gt;If on the first roll the player rolls 2 stampedes, 1 grazing, and one Lasso, The player MUST hold the 2 stampedes, however since the number of held dice in this round is 2, the grazing and the lasso will be rerolled. If the player rolled 1 stampede, 1 grazing, 1 Two, and One Runaway, the player MUST hold the stampede and the grazing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the rolls, movement is figured as such.&lt;br/&gt;-If all four are stampedes the player will roll all 4 die one time and move BACKWARDS the number of spaces totaled up on the roll.&lt;br/&gt;-For the total of all Ones, Twos, and Threes the player will move that many spaces FORWARD minus one space for each grazing die. &lt;br/&gt;-For each Runaway that has not been lassoed, the player moves BACKWARDS one space.&lt;br/&gt;-For each Runaway that has been lassoed the player will move forward TWICE the total number of spaces listed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
