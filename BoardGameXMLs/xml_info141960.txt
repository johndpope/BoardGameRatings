			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game just got a little more &amp;ldquo;epic&amp;rdquo;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a cry that would be heard through the ages, the renegade god of death fell dead at Duncan&amp;rsquo;s feet. An unnatural silence swallowed the room as the companions sat in awe of what they had done. It had been a long three years since the minister&amp;rsquo;s office where the adventurer&amp;rsquo;s had first meet. Long had been the road that had brought them to this point. They had searched the tombs for the missing artifacts only to discover the existence of the Cult of the Undying Master. It had taken them years to work through the dungeons and caverns were the Cult had hidden the relics. It was with great sacrifice, that they had brought together all the artifacts to call down the renegade deity who had been withering the world. His defeat came with high costs. They had lost friends... Calim Shaad, the Cleric who gave his life to protect the group&amp;rsquo;s, Wizzel the Goblin, whose lovable antics ultimately cost him his life for digging too deep into the cult&amp;rsquo;s activities, and Jade... Duncan would never forget the price his sister had just paid to kill the god of death.&lt;br/&gt;    A moment of silence fell over the gathered adventurers as the smoke cleared from the room crafted from the very fabric of the night&amp;rsquo;s sky.&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;ldquo;Is... is it over?&amp;rdquo; Asked Kalimdra as she wiped a few tears from her bloodied face.&lt;br/&gt;    No one was quite sure. No one had ever &amp;ldquo;killed&amp;rdquo; Death before. The irony would have struck them but they found themselves captivated by the moment.&lt;br/&gt;    Then, a slow smile spread across Duncan&amp;rsquo;s lips.&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;ldquo;No. This is only the beginning.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally!&lt;br/&gt;Rules for play beyond 20th level for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game System!
