			<description>(From the Game Cover)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ah, the dating game. The prowl, the excitement...the inevitable crash and burn.  The only thing that comes close to a great date is one that ends so badly your friends take pity and get you drunk. If that's your fate anyway, we say do it up BIG! Make the worst match, pick the most horrific venue, and top it all off with the tackiest final words ever uttered. Then sit back, tell your sob story, and let the free drinks flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw, then play cards on themselves (and their opponents) in order to maximize their score (meaning they get more free beer from their friends) and minimize their opponents' (meaning they get LESS free beer).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
