			<description>The goal of this game is to build a pyramid of monkeys. There are three types of monkeys and all three types come in three colors. Per turn you can only build your pyramid in one color. When building the other players only see the back of each monkey, so they don't know the constitution of other players' pyramids. The only way to find out is to attack! And attacking is also necessary to keep other players from finishing their pyramids. Finishing your pyramid is a true feat of bananalympics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
