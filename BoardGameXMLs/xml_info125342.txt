							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Norse Harbour</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Situated at the shore of a large sweet water lake is this small harbour. Its foundations were laid long before the current Norse inhabitant decided to settle here. As a matter of fact by the time they built their longhouses in this place the harbour lay in ruins. Still enough of it remained to make it feasible for the fishermen among the settlers to at least partially restore it. Nowadays the harbour's basin is cleared of rubble but only a few large stone blocks hint at the fortifications that originally crowned the walls ringing it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The walled basin provides the village's fishing boats with adequate protection against the occasional storm. The settlers went even so far to bring a menhir from their old ancestral lands as a safety measure against ghosts and more sinister things that might haunt a ruined place like this. But despite their best efforts and regular sacrifice of fish, wheat and mead one of their boats sunk just outside the harbour on a particular foggy day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
