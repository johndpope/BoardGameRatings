			<description>From the Chaosium website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Call of Cthulhu Scenario of Darkness and Terror set in the Roaring 20s&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a convention scenario with highly detailed characters and handouts intended for a theatrical style presentation in a single long session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is intended for 4-6 players, and can be completed in a single 5-7 hour session. It is not a scenario for the squeamish keeper or players, and some may view the drama herein as harsh. The game begins on September 15, 1927.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scene 1 &amp;ndash; Opening the Door &amp;ndash; 9:00 AM Thursday &amp;ndash; September 15th&lt;br/&gt;Most of the digging crew has been dismissed. The foreman, Harold Granby and two of his trusted crew remain above with a stock of crating materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters are gathered at the entrance to the vault. The tunnel is somewhat cramped and narrow. It is about 50 feet in length and extends down a flight of fieldstone steps from what was once the basement of an old house. Like a mining tunnel, it is shored up with strong wooden beams every few feet. At the end of the tunnel the characters face a solid granite door with a thick verdigris-covered copper ring. The door is rather plain and appears to have been marked with painted symbols that have been mostly worn away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario begins with the opening of the door.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
