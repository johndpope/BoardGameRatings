			<description>Atride is a three-player abstract strategy game with a rock-paper-scissors mechanic between the three players: the foxes can kill the chickens, but the chickens can kill the snakes which can kill the foxes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with five of their animal ranged along one side of a 7x7 triangular board. On their turn they advance one of their animals one step in one of two forward directions. They can capture a prey animal by putting two of their animals in a line with it (custodian capture) or in a small triangle with it. A captured animal is replaced with an additional animal of the team that captured it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to get one of their animals to the opposite corner of the triangle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
