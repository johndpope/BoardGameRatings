							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NBA Baller Beats</name>
									
			<description>In the game, various instructions to handle the basketball scroll down a lane on screen. Players are instructed to handle the ball various ways, including dribbling it in the left or right hand, passing it from one hand to another, dribbling between legs or faking a pass, all to the rhythm of the in-game music. In this respect, the game has been considered as a possible way to teach basic basketball handling skills to novices. A tutorial mode called &amp;quot;Beat School&amp;quot; can assist players with the various moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can choose an NBA team and play in an environment adorned with that team's logo. Various unlockable content is also available, including in-game posters, trading cards and highlight videos for each team's players. Three different skill levels can be chosen - rookie, pro and baller. Songs can be played in different venues, including a basketball court beach and an amusement park. The in-game environments visually react to the beats of each song. In addition to the game's single player mode, there is also a versus mode in which players switch out at different points of the match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;NBA Baller Beats&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
