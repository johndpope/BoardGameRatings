							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Cadets: Ship of The Line</name>
									
			<description>This Ship of the Line plastic miniature is an upgrade to the cardboard token that represents the players' ship in Space Cadets.  It fits within a one inch square, and stands on its built-in pedestal to a total height of about half an inch.  This was produced as a preorder incentive, and the leftovers were made available for purchase &amp;quot;while supplies last&amp;quot; shortly after the game's release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a gray plastic mini, while Space Cadets: Flagship is blue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
