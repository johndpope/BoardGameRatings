			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ever wanted to know exactly what your hero did&amp;nbsp;to become a 1st level character? Now you can. Zeroes to Heroes is all about playing your character&amp;nbsp;from level 0 to level 1. The worlds greatest roleplaying game&amp;nbsp;just got a little... less epic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are an ordinary person, with nothing special about you other than a small amount of natural skill. Whether by choice or by chance, you have been thrust into a life of&amp;nbsp; adventure and danger. If you're going to survive, you'll need to learn new skills fast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've heard the takes of the Legendary Heroes of old, and by following their lead, you&amp;rsquo;re hope to live for another day. Not everyone's cut out to be a hero and not everyone thrust down the heroes path makes it to the other end. Only you can decide if you have what it takes to go from being a Zero to a Hero.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
