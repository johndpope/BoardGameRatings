							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">An Average Modern High School</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob looked up. He heard the rumble overhead and knew that he would only have minutes to find shelter before the black rain fell and burned any flesh or clothing that came in contact with it. This was another consequence of the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cautiously and quietly, Jacob drew his ASP pistol and approached. He strained to hear anything out of the ordinary, but everything was deathly quiet. He knew that an old High School like this would be the perfect home for a band of marauders or one of the mutated creatures that now roamed the earth, but he didn't have any choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob reached the front door  of the abandoned school and yanked on the handle, but the door wouldn't budge. Closing his eyes, he concentrated and then spoke a word of power in a low whisper. The magical energy coalesced around him and his muscles began to pulsate. Once again, he pulled on the doors, but this time they opened easily despite the groaning protest of the rusted hinges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as he stepped past the threshold, he heard several deep, throaty growls echo in the empty hallway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where do you go when the action starts? To the battle map, of course! If you need a map of a modern structure, you need Modern Floorplans. The Modern Floorplans series from Fabled Environments offers gamers high quality maps in a variety of configurations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Want to draw it out yourself? Use the 8.5x11 map as a guide.&lt;br/&gt;     Want to simply drop the map on the table and play? Use either the full-scale map (if you have access to a plotter printer) or print the tiled version on regular paper and assemble a full-size version yourself in a matter of minutes. Both versions are scaled at 1 inch equals 5 feet.&lt;br/&gt;     In addition, each floorplan also comes in versions without room labels and without furniture as well as hex and square grids.&lt;br/&gt;     This flooplan take advantage of both the Layers feature and the Tile Large Page function of Adobe Acrobat X&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: All floorplans are rendered in black and white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All maps are created by an architectural drafter using AutoCAD. This gives all of the maps the realistic feel that your players crave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This modern two-story high school is over 500,000 square feet and includes a baseball diamond, football field and modular classroom. In addition, the map is presented in &amp;quot;vignettes&amp;quot; which break up the high school into a series of wide-format sheets. Areas that are detailed in the high school include: gym, cafeteria, classrooms, auto shop and library to name a few. If you need a high school for your modern/supers/horror game, then you need this map!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
