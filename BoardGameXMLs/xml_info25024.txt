The 'Malaya' quiz is specially created for you. It's an exciting, stimulating and educational board game set against the scenario of Malaysia's rich and colorful history.&lt;br/&gt;'Malaya' quiz will bring you through a journey back in time from the founding of melaka, the coming of the European Powers, the British Interference, the Japanese Occupation to the Road to Independence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game description:&lt;br/&gt;The game is a simple history trivia game focusing on Malaysia's history from the Melaka sultanate period to the independence of Malaysia.&lt;br/&gt;Players start from a common starting point and move towards a common ending point. Players roll a die and move the stated number of places, and one opponent will draw a trivia question card from a deck of 40 and ask the active player a question from the card. Each card has 4 categories (each with a question and an answer) and which question the player is asked depends on the spot the player lands on.&lt;br/&gt;If the player answers correctly, he is allowed another turn.&lt;br/&gt;If the player answers incorrectly, play passes on to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;Along the way to the ending point, there are special spots on the board where the player will have to perform special actions such as answering 2 questions (instead of 1), losing a turn or rolling again.&lt;br/&gt;The first player who reaches the end wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
