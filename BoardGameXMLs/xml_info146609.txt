							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tar Heel Basketball Trivia</name>
									
			<description>A variant of Trivial Pursuit where the questions are exclusively about the UNC Chapel Hill basketball team, during the Dean Smith era. Instead of collecting pie wedges, you collect rings, which you place around your Old Well playing piece. Categories are broken down by time period, general questions about UNC Basketball history, and questions about the coaching staff. Players win by collecting rings in all colors, and then moving to the picture of Dean Smith and answering one final question about the staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
