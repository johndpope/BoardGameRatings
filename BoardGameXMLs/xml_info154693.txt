			<description>HEROES OF VALDOR is a fantasy adventure board game where the players assume the roles of Heroic Characters in the savage world of Valdor, a place where three races (Human, Elf and Dwarf) have lived and fought for millennia with only a few scattered decades where peace was declared between the races. Now in the east, an invasion is occurring; an invasion by an evil and foul race of Orcs along with their minions of Goblins, Trolls, and a variety of terrifying creatures, led by their powerful and terrifying Sorcerer Overlord by the name of Valtigorn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is up to the Heroes to help unite the various races and tribes of Valdor in order to gather enough forces to defeat the Army of Valtigorn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
