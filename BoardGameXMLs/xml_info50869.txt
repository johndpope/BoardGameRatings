			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains a wide variety of adaptable d20 enhancements designed around a primitive theme. Much of this material was developed from research on ancient Africa, Australia, Polynesia and America. Many of these enhancements are based heavily on real world facts or folklore. The rest is inspired by biology, anthropology and assorted other sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is designed to be as easily adaptable to other campaign settings as possible. For example, in &lt;br/&gt;Chapter 1 there is a vagueness associated with the race&amp;rsquo;s religions, lands, relations, and languages. This is intended to facilitate adaptability. Players are encouraged to flesh out what they need and change what they don&amp;rsquo;t like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout this book there has also been a number efforts made to maximize the use of space by omitting &lt;br/&gt;any none essential material. The reader might notice, for example, that the races are missing a number of standard entries such as &amp;ldquo;Names&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Adventures.&amp;rdquo; Such information has been omitted and the space has been used to discuss more interesting rules elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
