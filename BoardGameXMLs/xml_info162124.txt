							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Coal, and the Kaiser</name>
									
			<description>Coal, and the Kaiser is a naval warfare simulation portraying naval surface warfare in the period 1904-1918. The simulation presents aspects of this warfare through a series of scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenario generators provided with the game can be used to create scenarios typical for the time and place that the game covers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game presents these battles on a tactical, ship-to-ship level. The game is for two sides: each controlling the ships of a contending naval force. Ships are represented by 1/6000 scale miniatures, with any 4 foot by 6 foot level surface serving as a playing area. Movement and combat are conducted in accordance with these rules of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
