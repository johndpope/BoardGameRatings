			<description>Discover this exciting new way of playing Baseball. You are now the Manager of your own team. You can make every choice that a major league manager makes. You decide when to HIT and RUN, whet to STEAL a base, or when to use your all important PINCH HITTERS! This game is as easy to play as real baseball. It's hours of family fun at home and at parties, for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each manager places his four base runner discs in the dug out. The pinch hitter is placed in the bull pen and moved up one space as they are used. Place the out disc at the top of the playing field and move it as outs are made. The manager whose team is at bat should place his first batter at home plate (H). Take the dice and say aloud which play he is trying from the ten selection at the top of the game board. Example: Aloud &amp;quot;Bunt for hit&amp;quot;, now pitch the dice. Combine the face value of the dice roll and find the result of the play on the board under the play selection. Each time a base runner crosses home plate one run is scored to that team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
