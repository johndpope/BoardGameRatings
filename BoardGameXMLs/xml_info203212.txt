			<description>Copoka is a game about a bird flying freely above the totalitarian city of Copoka, trying to find and collect twigs for its nest. As you assemble the nest a story of intrigue and politics unfolds around you.  The town and its people are struggling with internal conflicts, and as a player you experience the revolution taking place by overhearing conversations between citizens. But what are human concerns to a bird anyway?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
