			<description>From the website: &amp;quot; A new crisis is forming in Central Europe. A right-wing German government has seized several disputed nuclear weapons brought into their nation by American military actions in the Ukraine. The German chancellor has demanded the disarmament and the immediate removal of all US military personnel in Central Europe as well as Germany being recognized as &amp;quot;a nuclear power&amp;quot;. The President of the United States appears to capitulate to the German demands; however, Lt. General Al Malin, commander of the US Tenth Corps, refuses to disarm without a fight and leads a bold, yet desperate plan to invade Germany, recover the nuclear weapons, and march his units to the North Sea to uphold American military honor. &amp;quot; Based on the novel by Harold Coyle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this, you'll be provided with the game's mapsheets, rules, charts, etc., while you will utilize the components from Axis &amp;amp; Allies or related games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
