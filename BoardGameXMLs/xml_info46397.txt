			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trade the guilds for gangs and the staffs for Glocks.&lt;br/&gt;Trade the folklore for funk and the history for hip-hop.&lt;br/&gt;Trade tomes for CDs, bards for DRs, trade minstrels for MCs.&lt;br/&gt;Trade what you think for the harsh reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a world where slingers peel each others caps for the secrets of the streets.  This is a time just before it all went commercial and everybody and their mama had a record deal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a world just one beat from our own where magic has hit the mainstream and slingers-turned-rappers are getting gold records while sowing discord among the elders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a world where saying too much can cost you your life.  Take it from me, kid, life on the street ain't no plaything and you have to work for your payday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the street the most important this you have is your Wyrd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
