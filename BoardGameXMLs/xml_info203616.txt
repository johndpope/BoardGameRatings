							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rift</name>
									
			<description>Rift is an arena-battle style game that unites fast-paced action with strategic card management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An idyllic world is just one of many in the cosmos - until the Rift appears. Manifesting as a magical tear in space-time, the Rift contains the promise of absolute power - and total destruction. Up to four immortal warriors arrive on the planet to claim the Rift as their own, even as the energy begins to tear the world apart. The storms, volcanos, and earthquakes that the Rift creates are fair game to the immortals, who use the disasters to power their attacks against each other. Only one will be left standing to claim the Rift as their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rift is a streamlined dueling system, where the cards in a player's hand simultaneously represents their life total and their options. Damage taken forces a player to discard, leading to agonizing choices as the game reaches its world-shattering conclusion. The novel, unique rule-set is both quick to pick up and features near-endless strategic depth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
