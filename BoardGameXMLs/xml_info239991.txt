			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thank you for picking up the Tamer Playtest Packet. This write-up is designed to be a simple way for new players to the game (Digimon: Digital Adventures) to have a small selection of pre-designed characters to use which should somewhat fit in the majority of campaigns. These characters are already written in their entirety, meaning their personalities, backstories, stats, and suggested progressions are all set up beforehand. But as a GM don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to use these characters as NPC&amp;rsquo;s if you feel your own setting could use a few more characters in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
