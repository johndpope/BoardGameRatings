			<description>This is the full version of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the book blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Lovecraftesque is the GMless storytelling game of brooding cosmic horror you&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for. You tell the story of a lone Witness at the mercy of strange and terrifying events. The game helps you create a slow-building mystery, culminating in a climactic scene of horror.&lt;br/&gt;- You create your own monsters and mystery that feel like something out of Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s notebook.&lt;br/&gt;- All the players contribute clues to surprise and creep each other out.&lt;br/&gt;- The rules ensure that the story flows seamlessly, as if an invisible GM were guiding it.&lt;br/&gt;- There won&amp;rsquo;t be any Mi-Go or Deep Ones&amp;mdash;you&amp;rsquo;ll get a completely fresh take on the genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LOVECRAFTESQUE IS A GAME FOR 2-5 PEOPLE AND TAKES 3-4 HOURS TO PLAY.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Beautifully crafted &amp;hellip; A valuable contribution to the growing canon of roleplaying games&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; The Mary Sue&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The GM-less storytelling approach is both refreshing and inspiring &amp;hellip; The structure and play is solid, and a lot of fun for players with different levels of gaming experience and Lovecraft knowledge.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Shoggoth.Net&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lovecraftesque is one of my favorite games from the last few years &amp;hellip; Highly recommended!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; The Gauntlet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;In less than three hours, my friend and I had crafted, from nothing, a sanity-losing concoction of cosmic dread and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier with the product.&amp;rdquo; -Ericvulgaris.Com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lovecraftesque is a very special game. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to teach, easy to play, and works even when you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t expect it to &amp;hellip; It is a beautifully crafted game with surprising depth considering the simplicity and usability of the ruleset.&amp;rdquo; -On the Remembered Slopes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
