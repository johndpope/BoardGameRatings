			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An archaic cult steals innocents for its evil rites. A necromancer builds an undead fortress under an ancient burial ground. A creature from a previous age tries to bring its master back into the world while evil forces prepare for war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Module M2: Beneath the Razor's Edge is the sequel to the well recieved M1: An Echo of Days Past. This second module in the series takes the adventurers further towards their destiny in thwarting the ancient evil of the god, Ehalazuhn and his servants. It is a large adventure which will require several sessions and will see the characters progress from 5th to 6th Level. It is designed with the latest edition of the world's favourite RPG in mind but can be adapted easily into other editions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to An Echo of Days Past, Beneath the Razor's Edge can be played as a whole campaign arc or can be used to flesh out any current home grown setting. It includes an evil shrine, an undead complex, as well as a wraith's tower and a ruined fortress as well as several challenging single encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
