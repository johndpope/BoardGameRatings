							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dice Box</name>
									
			<description>A simple abstract strategy game using dice and a 5x5 grid board.  Each player takes a different colour of dice, and a seed die is rolled and placed in the centre of the board.  Then all players roll their dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his turn, a player must place one die if possible, but it need not be his own.  A die must be placed so that all orthogonally adjacent dice have a face value either one higher or one lower than it.  If no dice can be placed, you reroll your dice as your turn.  At the end of the round, when all dice possible have been played, players score based on the total face value of all dice of their colour that are on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
