			<description>The aim of the game is to win all 60 chips. Before playing starts the chips are given a certain value. It is allow just to play for the own honor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In fact, Hazar is some kind of &amp;quot;Las Vegas in your pocket&amp;quot;, played in Bars and Cafes, by groups having fun with losing or winning money... There are 60 steel-chips. Up to 12 players (5 chips each) put their chips on numbers in different combinations. The stakes are high, because, in the end, there is only one player, who wins the 60 chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
