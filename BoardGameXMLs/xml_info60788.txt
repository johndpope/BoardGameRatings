			<description>On the Right Track is designed to be thought-provoking for soon-to-be released inmates, or newly released parolees. After playing the game, it should be clear that in order to successfully make it off parole, a person should take care of his or her responsibilities, keep employed, stay clean and sober, and avoid situations that could jeopardize freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning the Game The Winner is the first person to make it off parole. It doesn't matter how much money you have left, or if you're flat broke. What's important is that you made it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     One game board&lt;br/&gt;     Four colored markers&lt;br/&gt;     Twenty blue chance cards&lt;br/&gt;     Fifteen red chance cards&lt;br/&gt;     One die&lt;br/&gt;     Fifty bills of play money ($50 each)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
