			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It's simple: your cargo or your life. I know which one is worth more to me.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Dream, the vast and volatile Slumbering Sea stretches out past the edges of infinity&amp;mdash;a gateway to impossible adventure, or a realm of lethal insanity more dangerous than any of its inhabitants. Consider, then, what strange and powerful beings might sail that sea for their leisure and profit. And then consider what kind of stupendously formidable pirate might prey on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product provides Game Masters with details on a skull-crushing swashbuckler found amongst the Faces of the Tarnished Souk, ready for immediate use in any campaign&amp;mdash;but especially for use within the Coliseum Morpheuon. Each entry features ingenious stat-blocks from multiple OGL sources, history, motivation, secrets, and insight into the NPC's most carefully guarded dreams, along with complete game statistics for low, middle, and high levels of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Dread Captain Miraxa, a priestess of plunder on an ocean of wonder&lt;br/&gt;    CR 21 Female horrifically overpowered sea-born draken fighter 15&lt;br/&gt;    CR 14 Female horrifically overpowered sea-born draken fighter 10&lt;br/&gt;    CR 7 Female horrifically overpowered sea-born draken fighter 5&lt;br/&gt;    The Impending Doom, a ironnclad pirate ship worthy of epic adventure&lt;br/&gt;    Introducing new magic items including arcane eyepatches and a monster of a morningstar&lt;br/&gt;    Featuring Horrifically Overpowered feats from the brilliant brains at Super Genius Games!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
