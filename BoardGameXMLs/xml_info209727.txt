							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombicide: Black Plague â€“ 3D Doors</name>
									
			<description>Is there anything more terrifying than a closed door in Zombicide: Black Plague?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What horrors lie behind it?&lt;br/&gt;What is that gurgling noise it's barely muffling?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 3D Doors Pack contains 27 doors with 3 different designs to keep players' adventures looking fresh. Containing more doors than required in the base game, players get a variety to keep them stocked up for future expansions. The doors don't just stand upright creating a visual barrier on the board, they'll also swing open when Survivors have gained access to the other side!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
