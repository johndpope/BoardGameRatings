			<description>The team known as the Southwest Sentinels were in trouble. Chokepoint had blindsided them in their headquarters in Fort Adamant. It was a rough fight. The fact that the heroes were getting no military support in this fight, and that no alarms had been set off by Chokepoint&amp;rsquo;s entirely unstealthy arrival was not immediately concerning to them, but the Southwest Sentinels began to realize things were not quite what they had assumed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They fled through the military installation, narrowly dodging the attacks from Chokepoint. As they entered the lower levels, Chokepoint tore through a wall before them, and then was incapacitated by a blast of power. The wall she had just destroyed housed a secret room the heroes had never seen before. In that room were four large glowing crystals, each radiating a different spectrum of energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behind them, Chokepoint groaned and began struggling to her feet. She would be back at full power in no time - the heroes had a choice to make. And they choose survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, Doctor Medico, Mainstay, The Idealist, and Writhe harness the power of Oblivion Shards and fight against the end of all things. They hold back the Void when no one else can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sentinels of the Multiverse: Void Guard is a box set of four hero characters, complete with their own hero character cards and decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
