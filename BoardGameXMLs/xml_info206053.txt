			<description>The name of this old French game means &amp;quot;Don't get angry&amp;quot;, and was probably inspired by Sorry or Ludo in that four pieces must get onto a track and around the board to home. However, it seems to be a more basic game, with no slides or shortcuts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a two-sided board, with a 44-space circular track on one side for up to four players, and a 60-space circle with six outward &amp;quot;U&amp;quot;s on the reverse for up to six players. It comes with six sets of four wooden pawns (red, green, ivory, brown, purple and black) and a wooden dice cup about 4&amp;quot; tall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is undated, but the illustration on the box suggests 1930s or earlier. The picture features two men in double-breasted suits, sitting in rattan chairs and playing the game on a table, with countryside seen through the window behind them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box and board declare &amp;quot;mod&amp;egrave;le depose&amp;quot;, and the box has a publisher logo with a &amp;quot;marque d&amp;eacute;pos&amp;eacute;e&amp;quot;, but the name of the publisher does not appear. The logo has a mermaid sitting on a rock, holding up a horizontal diamond shape containing the letters &amp;quot;STREM&amp;quot; and another tiny letter or dot on each end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
