							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fair Play: Spelet som ger kunskap om r√§ttvis handel</name>
									
			<description>Fair Play is themed around the relationship between rich and poor countries. Each player has a role: producer, importer, shopkeepers or consumer. In the game there are seven countries in every continent there players can invest. When a player lands on a square with a question mark, the player must answer a question from a questionnaire booklet, in areas such as social studies, geography and history. The winner is the one getting most points at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
