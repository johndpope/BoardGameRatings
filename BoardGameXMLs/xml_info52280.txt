							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Keeton Must Die! Teddy Bear Blood Sport</name>
									
			<description>Winner of the 1KM1KT, Free RPG Blog 24 Hour Competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;At one time their stores were once populated every strip mall in America. Children would line up to create their new friend: pick a skin, eyes, a nose, the mouth and then fill it with fluff. It was magical experience and every child wanted one. However, soon the economy failed and the stores were left to decline, leaving thousands of empty husks hanging lifeless on the shelves, waiting for someone to give them a home and love them dearly. This love never came.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Reginald Keeton, the CEO of TeddyBears, Inc. took three popular things and combined them into a marketing frenzy unlike anything anyone had seen before. Reality TV, Blood Sport, the cute wasted husks of the Teddy Bears of his empty stores and created entertainment that took the world by storm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Keeton was as astute and powerful if misguided student of the occult and used his talents in dark magics to invest the empty husks with lost souls he pulled from the depths of Hell. This act of desperation led to many of the bears to be home to some of the most vile and twisted souls ever seen by humanity. However, this worked to his advantage&amp;hellip;for a time. The bears were bloodthirsty killers and performed exactly as he directed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Children and their misguided parents lined up to watch their favorite stuffed animals slash and tear each other apart, ripping the enchanted fluff from their guts, all while the audience screamed in sheer joy. The show became a massive hit and things were great for many months and TeddyBears, Inc. saw huge profit margins and Keeton was hailed as a master businessman. He named his creations ScareBears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then the trouble began. The souls became restless and unhappy in their condition. Frankly, they were a little pissed they had been trapped in puny little furry bodies, can you really blame them? People began disappearing from the set of the TV show, the telltale sign of a little fluff left at the scene of the crimes was a dead giveaway as to who was at fault. Initially Keeton did all he could to cover the problem and continue his show. Quickly the bears out smarted him and began plotting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, a few bears failed to appear for their performance. Their cages were checked but found empty. The ScareBears have been released upon the world. Keeton nervously now watches his back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter the world of&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teddy Bear Blood Sport!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
