			<description>One Shot is aptly named. It is said her relic's massive Goliath Cannon can bring down a starship. It is a theory that few enemy commanders are willing to test. One Shot combines her devastating fire power with an unmatched skill commanding her troops, guiding their fire into the enemy ranks with surgical precision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gifted with rare and mighty gifts, Relic Knights are the ultimate leaders for your cadres. More than just powerful game pieces, these stunning models are beautiful centerpieces for your miniature collection!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
