							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Battle of Chaeronea, 338 BC</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;Fought near Chaeronea, in Boeotia, this was the greatest victory of Philip II of Macedon. There, Philip (with 32,000 men) defeated the smaller combined forces of Athens and Thebes, securing Macedonian hegemony in Greece. The battle itself pitted the classical phalanx of the Athenian and Theban confederates and the Macedonian phalanx of Philip.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use. The Macedonian units portrated in the game include the Companion Cavalry, Pikemen, Skirmishers, and Commanders (Phillip and Alexander). The Greek units include Athenian and Theban Hoplites, Skirmishers, and the Theban Sacred Band.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designer states: &amp;ldquo;This game was designed for an advanced 5th grade class studying classical Greece. I picked Charoenea because I didn't have any Persian figures, and because I thought it would be fun for them to get to see Alexander on the battlefield . . . The Greeks probably don't have much chance in this scenario, I'm afraid, and the players should be prepared for this. It is more a historical simulation than a &amp;lsquo;fair&amp;rsquo; game. There were 8 students, but the game is designed for 9 players.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
