			<description>Just Typical is a party game where players controversial statements about men and women.  Those who find themselves in agreement with the other players more often will win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, the active player draws a card from the deck, which could be a Controversy Card or a Just Typical Card - which is which is marked on the back of the card.  In either case, the active player chooses one of three statements on the card and reads it aloud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Controversy Cards have statements that refer to women, men, or relationships, such as &amp;quot;Women make better diplomats.&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;More alcohol is consumed on a hen night than a stag night.&amp;quot;  Players then secretly vote, using voting cards, as to whether they Agree or Disagree with the statement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just Typical Cards describe behaviours or situations, such as &amp;quot;Shopping for things that are not needed.&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Putting an empty milk carton back in the fridge.&amp;quot;  Players secretly vote, this time voting for if they thing that trait is &amp;quot;Typically Male&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Typically Female&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once everyone has voted, the votes are revealed.  The players in the majority score +1 point, those in the minority score -1 point (but never going below 0).  In the case of a tie, the active player's choice  is considered the majority for scoring purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach 14 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
