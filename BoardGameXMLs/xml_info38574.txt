							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle of Hastings (1066 AD)</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;When Edward the Confessor, King of England, died without an heir three men claimed the throne. Harold Godwinson had the advantage of actually being in England, and he was crowned king. The other claimants, William Duke of Normandy and Harald Hardrada (King of Norway), were prepared to fight for the throne.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Hardrada struck first, invading Northern England with a large Viking army . . . The Vikings were routed, and Hardrada was killed. Harold didn't get much time to celebrate, however, as he was soon informed that William had landed in Southern England with an army of Norman knights and mercenaries.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Again Harold raced to meet the threat. He decided to confront the Normans as soon as possible. Harold's Saxons formed their shield wall on top of Senlac Hill. With their flanks protected by rough terrain, they knew the Normans would be forced to attempt a frontal assault. All day long the Normans tried and failed to break through the Saxon lines. Then Harold's men made a fatal error and chased the Normans back down the hill, opening gaps in their shield wall. The Normans were quick to exploit the mistake, and they were able to break through and win. Harold was killed on the field of battle, and William became King of England.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt; A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures mounted two per base. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Saxon force is divided into five commands composed of Fyrd militia and Housecarls. The Norman force is also divided into five commands, each of which is composed of cavalry, infantry, and archers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
