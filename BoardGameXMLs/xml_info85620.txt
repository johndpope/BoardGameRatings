			<description>Game inspired by the commercial success of Pass the Pigs. In this case, the 'dice' are two cute little cows. You throw the cows on to a board, around the outside of which is an illustrated picket fence. The fence is divided by fence-posts and you use this as a scoring track. Made to advertise Anchor Butter, a leading brand in Britain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
