			<description>[From Activision catalog, winter 1982:]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get your sea legs, because Steve Cartwright's new submarine adventure game has just been launched.  Your divers have finally located the greatest sunken treasure on the ocean floor, but getting back to the mother ship could get a little tricky.  Your men have been spotted by a fleet of pirate scavengers and if they don't get 'em, the killer sharks will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[From instruction manual:]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your divers have retrieved the buried treasure, and now you must come to their rescue.  The object of Seaquest is to retrieve as many treasure-divers as you can, while dodging and blasting enemy subs and killer sharks.  All before your oxygen runs out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[From box back:]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conceived and designed by Steve Cartwright.&lt;br/&gt;For one or two Sea Captains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're far out at sea, down the way where sunsets turn the ocean top into a kaleidoscope of colors.  And, you've discovered the greatest sunken treasure of the Western Hemisphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But things don't sit right just yet.  Your band of divers, laden with gold, haven't returned.  Hearty lads though they are, they've been down too long -- a little fishy it seems.  Best you cruise below and take a look see for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EGADS!  A little fishy?  Battle stations!  Prepare to take on divers.  Killer sharks are nipping at their toes, and a nasty gang of scavenger subs is after their treasure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, batten down the hatches.  Man the torpedo tubes.  Watch your oxygen supply.  And, whatever you do, don't let those pirate subs steal away your gold!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
