							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ULTRA Deadly</name>
									
			<description>From published material&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YOU are John Canaan, an American secret agent asked to serve the British government during World War II. Your assignment: keep ULTRA (the best-kept secret of WWII) from falling into the wrong hands. It is known only to a few higher-ups in the Allied command, and when a briefing on ULTRA is stolen by Germany's top agent, you are sent to retrieve it. The Germans will have a hard time cracking the coded brief, but if they do, the Allied invasion of Normandy could be mass suicide!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To succeed in your mission, you'll have to make snap decisions under pressure and use the abilities you've acquired after years in the service--firing a gun with deadly accuracy, overpowering an opponent in hand-to-hand combat, and sneaking into and out of areas with uncanny agility. The challenge is yours because the situation is ULTRA deadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional User Information&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ULTRA Deadly is Sniper! Adventure Gamebook #5. This title is part of a series of solo adventures published to generate interest in TSR's release of Sniper! 2nd edition&amp;quot; after their acquisition of SPI. The player follows a series of paragraphs, each of which end with a series of choices (or die roll checks) that continue the adventure to the next paragraph. The simple combat resolution system requires only the game book, 2 dice, pencil, &amp;amp; paper. The abilities of the player are preprinted in the gamebook and include Stealth, Hand-to-Hand, Firing, &amp;amp; Bomb-Throwing. The player's starting weapons and equipment are also included. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
