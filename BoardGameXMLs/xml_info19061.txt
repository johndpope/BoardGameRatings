			<description>A game released to coincide with the golden jubilee of the reign of King George III of Great Britain, who came to the throne in 1760. The game board consists of a spiral track. The spaces contain pictures showing events which took place during the reign of George. These include his wedding, the birth of his children, various wars (with Spain, France, and the American colonies), the discovery of the source of the Blue Nile, riots in England, the founding of Botany Bay, the king&amp;rsquo;s first alarming illness (1788), and the abolition of the slave trade among other events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the many games inspired by the Royal Game of Goose, described in RC Bell's &amp;quot;Board and Table Games of Many Civilizations&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players race down a spiral track, all starting from different corners, collecting rewards and paying fines. The first player to reach the middle space, &amp;quot;Jubilee&amp;quot;, wins. The Jubilee space depicts George III on his throne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
