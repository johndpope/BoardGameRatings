			<description>From the Publisher's Description on the Kickstarter Project Page last year:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You awaken on a cold floor, the taste of cotton in the back of your mouth. Your tongue felt heavy, thick; your arms refused to push your up. You floundered for a few minutes there, trying to get your bearings, trying to gain stability, control. You took a breath and were hit with something metallic mixed with the scent of sweat and fear. You opened your eyes, cautiously, and pushed yourself up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The room was small, bare concrete walls and hard stone floor. That was the first thing your saw; the second was the body. It lay in the center of the room, face-down, sprawled, a crimson pool congealed around it. The man was dressed in formal attire, though the clothes were shabby and worn. His hair was dark, mussed, matted with blood.&lt;br/&gt; You pushed yourself back, away from the corpse, and looked around the room wildly, alert for danger. That was when you saw the others. Four of them, two men and two women, all around the room. Three were unconscious, prone, as you had been, unceremoniously left on the floor to wake. The Fourth, one of the women, was huddled in the corner, her eyes shut tight, rocking gently and muttering to herself.&lt;br/&gt; Who were these people? Was one of them the killer? Were they all potential victims? What was this place, and why were you here?&lt;br/&gt; You searched your memory for the answers, but found nothing. Nothing at all. That struck you as slightly odd at first, but the more you searched the more terrified you became. You did not even know your name. The more you searched, though, the more you became aware that nothing was there. you could remember nothing of your life, nothing of the events that had led you here.&lt;br/&gt; Something was very wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who are you?  Do you even know?  If you do, you're better off than I am, I'll tell you that much.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This is both a game and an adventure.  There is a story here; there are characters and places, there is a beginning, a middle, and an endgame.  But this adventure is not tied to any particular game or setting.  True, it uses the FATE 3.0 SRD as the basis for its rules, but liberties are taken, modifications are made.  You do not need any one specific FATE game to play with this book; all you need is this book, and a knowledge of how FATE works (the free FATE SRDs help with this).&lt;br/&gt; You're a regular person.  A good person.  This is a lie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, you are a citizen of the Dome.  You are a good person, and you serve society in some way.  You have a good life, good friends, a loving family.  At least, that's what you think.  The life you think you know is a lie, a cleverly constructed work of fiction pulled over your eyes to blind you to who and what you truly are.  In reality, you are broken, wicked.  You have done terrible things, and you have had terrible things done to you.  Your true self is at odds with your fabricated persona, and the two will come crashing together violently; it will be up to you to determine which one isyou.  Maybe both are.  This is a game about identity, discovering your true self, and coming to terms with it.&lt;br/&gt; Something is wrong with the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is also a game about discovering the truth about the world around you. The scenario presented within this book is an investigative scenario, steeped in noir, dark fantasy, and Lovecraftian horror.  While you discover yourself, you will investigate the world and the people around you.  You will peel back the veneer of wholesomeness to find the darkness beneath.  And when all is said and done, you will be faced with a choice: do you find redemption, or do you become the monster your memories say you are?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll see it soon, and when you do, you won't be able to shut your eyes. You'll see it everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
