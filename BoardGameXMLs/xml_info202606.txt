							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monastery of the Marble Palm</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the ocean&amp;rsquo;s shore, amid steep-sided sand dunes, stands Alrakkham&amp;rsquo;s Glory&amp;mdash;a 50-foot-tall, salt-encrusted hand carved from a single piece of blue marble. Despite being older than recorded history, the gigantic monolith shows little sign of weathering or damage and is famed for the many bizarre&amp;mdash;and no doubt magical&amp;mdash;phenomena plaguing the surrounding area. Localised earthquakes are common here and at night the veins in the blue marble seem to pulse in an almost rhythmic fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Centuries ago, a forgotten mason carved out the interior of the hand to create living spaces that a variety of hermits, eccentrics and strange beings have since occupied. Now occupied by a group of monks who study the mysteries of the marble hand and its unique effects on their ki powers the place is known as the Monastery of the Marble Palm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Places of Power are short, richly detailed supplements that each present a flavoursome locale such as a remote temple, borderland fort or reclusive wizard&amp;rsquo;s demesne. Ready to be plugged into almost any home campaign, each installment can be used as a waystop on the road to adventure, the home of a powerful NPC or even as a mini-adventure site in its own right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
