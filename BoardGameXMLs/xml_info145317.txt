			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blort II is a psuedo-Space Invader clone published by Hennsoft as shareware, with the option to send in $5 for a floppy disk containing additional files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main object of Blort II is to blow up a UFO that paces the top of the screen.  This is made difficult by the fact that your ship is constantly moving and you can only fire a single missile at a time.  Extra challenge is added in later levels when UFO's use mines to try and blow you up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
