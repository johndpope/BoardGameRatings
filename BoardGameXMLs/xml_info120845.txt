			<description>Genesis Rising: The Universal Crusade is a 3D Real-time strategy game set in a distant future. The game was developed by Metamorf and published by DreamCatcher Interactive and was released on March 20, 2007. The game takes place in space, where players control ships and try to eliminate the opponent. The game's primary focus is on squad tactics, which can be compared to Savage: The Battle for Newerth.&lt;br/&gt;The story is set in a mysterious futuristic universe where organic machines are built using genetic engineering. The player take on the role of Captain Iconah to explore and conquer the Universal Heart, the only part of the universe that's remained unconquered by the forces of humankind.[1]&lt;br/&gt;What makes Genesis Rising different from other RTS games is its story and background. Every (or almost every) ship in the game is completely organic as opposed to the standard plastic-and-metal hulks familiar to fans of Star Trek, Firefly, Homeworld or the Halo series. Unlike many science fiction video games, humankind is the dominant species of the galaxy instead of being powerless to some Godlike alien race. However, mankind in the game has also become very arrogant, proclaiming themselves to be on a divinely inspired crusade to overtake the Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Genesis Rising: The Universal Crusade&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
