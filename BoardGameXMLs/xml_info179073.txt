			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He stands a solitary vigil against forces outside the law!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1942, a 16-year-old Joe Kubert received his first professional solo assignment from Holyoke Publishing--the new superhero series &amp;ldquo;Volton.&amp;rdquo; He drew (and possibly scripted) four episodes, which appeared in the pages of Catman 8 &amp;ndash; 11, before he moved onto other projects... and a career that spanned seven decades and saw him develop into one of the greatest talents to ever work in comic books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volton is the first complete collect of these earliest known superhero works of Joe Kubert, and his fans can get an indepth look at his still-powerful storytelling style before he found the one that was uniquely his own. In addition to the classic comics, the book contains an addition to NUELOW Games&amp;rsquo;s OGL Modern d20 Superpowers rules, which fit smoothly into any OGL Modern or d20 Modern game since it uses the existing feats and talent trees system. The four feats and energy tree presented in this book gives you the tools needed to create characters like Volton and other heroes who channel and electricity and other energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
