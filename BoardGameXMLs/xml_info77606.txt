			<description>Keepsake is an adventure game developed by Wicked Studios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lydia, the main character, has just arrived at Dragonvale Academy, a school of magic. Her best friend, Celeste, agreed to meet her outside the school at a nearby fountain, but when Lydia arrives, the school is deserted and Celeste is nowhere to be found. With the help of a wolf (who claims to be both a dragon and a familiar to a powerful mage) named Zak, Lydia sets out to find out what happened at Dragonvale Academy that caused the disappearance of hundreds of people and to reunite with her best friend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keepsake is a third person point-and-click adventure game in which the user clicks areas on the screen to navigate and explore the world. The world is set up through fixed camera angles showing the portion of the area that the main character, Lydia, stands in. The user can click different locations and items to move, activate puzzles or cutscenes, and enter other areas.&lt;br/&gt;The game is played through exploring the world and solving puzzles to advance. The total gameplay length is estimated at 15 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Keepsake (video game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
