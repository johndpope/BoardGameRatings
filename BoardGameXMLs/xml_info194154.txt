							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cleanup</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cleanup is a freeform larp/activity for any number of cleaners, designed for situations where a group needs to clean and tidy an area in a hurry - for example, just before leaving a rental house where a small gaming convention was held. Dishes need to be washed, floors swept, garbage bagged and discarded. Ideally, doing all these chores while playing The Cleanup will make it more interesting and fun. As maintenance technicians aboard a giant military starship, there is plenty of excitement between chores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
