Experiment with cuddles, compliments, toys, gestures and very small edibles (including cat treats, moist cat food or tuna fish) to find Kitty&amp;rsquo;s favorite rewards. You and Kitty will both enjoy doing the tasks. Don&amp;rsquo;t play the game right after Kitty has eaten because she may be less motivated to perform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY: Roll the paw print dice, pick a matching paw print card, get your cat to do the activity, enter your score on the score pad.
