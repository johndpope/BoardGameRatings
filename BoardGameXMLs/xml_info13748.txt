			<description>A simple family game about the challenges of keeping up your grades while trying to become popular. Use your crib sheet to remember what to do each turn:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Initiate trades of cards if desired&lt;br/&gt;    Change cliques if desired (Cliques include Jocks, Fashion Slaves, Artsy Fartsies, and of course, Geeks. The clique you are in will affect your popularity and grades.)&lt;br/&gt;    Play a card (should you go to a sporting event for popularity, or do some homework to improve your grades? Or perhaps join a club or other group that will give you more lasting benefits?)&lt;br/&gt;    Perform any card drops as needed for Keepers you may have (card drops are used to determine success or failure on things such as cheerleader tryouts)&lt;br/&gt;    Adjust your score on the scoreboard if applicable, by moving your pawn(s) along the appropriate scoring track(s)&lt;br/&gt;    Replenish your hand from the deck, up to the current hand limit (hand limit changes each school year, starting with fewer cards Freshman year and more by Senior year)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of Senior year, each player multiplies their Popularity score by their Grades score, and the player with the highest total wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    School Daze: College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
