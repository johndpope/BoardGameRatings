			<description>Tired of waiting for subway trains?  Being pushed around from morning to night?  With the game of Le Jeu du Metro you finally get to run your own subway.  Throw off the trumpet player who can play only three notes, make room for that charming young man/woman waiting on the platform.  Most importantly, annoy your opponents by making them face walkouts, parcel bombs and sick passengers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts the game with a train card, ten passenger pieces placed on it, and a random, secret objective such as &amp;quot;have no passengers left to win&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;have 20+ passengers to win&amp;quot;. The game ends as soon as someone achieves their objective. Everyone is then dealt a hand of four action cards.  These cards can do things like add or subtract passengers from any train, switch passengers between trains, switch objectives or trains with an opponent, or oblige everyone to return some passengers to the platform.  Players take turns to play action cards until a secret objective is achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
