			<description>The game of Gung Ho is played on an 11 x 11 grid of points.  The playing pieces are plastic &amp;quot;towers&amp;quot; that are inserted into the grid points.  The idea of the game is to line up a fixed number of towers into a row either diagonally/vertically/or horizontally (5 for 2 players, or 4 for 3-4 players).  The game is quite simple, players take turns placing a tower piece into a game board location (once placed it cannot be moved).  The first player to meet the victory condition is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
