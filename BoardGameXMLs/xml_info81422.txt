			<description>Publisher's introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Synthesis is well suited to strongly story-driven role-playing where the main issues center on a struggle for self-definition against differing ideologies. The core of the system is rules that revolve around the Self Trait, which drive action that is character-centric.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Synthesis requires that the play group devise a Story Premise. A Story Premise is a question, which the play group addresses by actually playing the game. Synthesis supports a theoretically infinite set of these, but certain Story Premises work better than others. Namely, you will find it fairly easy to make Story Premises that somehow address something starting with &amp;quot;self-&amp;quot;. Self-respect, self-destruction, self-sacrifice, self-worth, and so on can be used as &amp;quot;seed words&amp;quot; to make a fuller Premise. One can use other ways of coming up with a Premise, of course, but keep the focus of Synthesis in mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
