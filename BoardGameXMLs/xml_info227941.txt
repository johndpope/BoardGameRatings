			<description>A design is placed on the table with the mirror standing behind it so that the player can see the reflection of the design in it.&lt;br/&gt;The player must not look at the design directly, but only at the reflection of it, and then by placing the point of the pencil he endeavors to follow the track, without staggering on to the grass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who can complete the most tracks wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
