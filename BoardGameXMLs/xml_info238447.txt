							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Punch Cards</name>
									
			<description>A short, party-sized game of robot combat.  Work with teams of 2-3 players to navigate your robot across a map filled with obstacles, find the robots controlled by the other teams, and punch them until they stop moving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The challenge is that everyone on your team is programming your robot independently, and your team's robot will move and act based on whichever actions get the most team votes.  To win the game, you'll need to anticipate what your team members are likely to do in a given turn, and work to enhance/boost their actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robots start with 11 basic action cards, and can add extra cards by picking up upgrades that are scattered around the map.  The game is fast, chaotic, and ridiculous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
