							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Skeetersoft Baseball</name>
									
			<description>A Major League Baseball simulation game, which has individual cards for each player and a set of result charts for each of 8 base situations (bases empty to bases loaded), rare plays, base stealing, base advancement, advanced pitching grades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After setting your lineup, players roll dice, obtain a result number from the player card, and then refer to charts for results. This will result in an out, or getting on base, with details about each outcome. Then you move on to the next batter. Standard rules of major league baseball apply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the cards are designed for play with all APBA game boards, it's highly recommended that you purchase the SkeeterSoft Boards and Advanced Pitching System.  All options in the SkeeterSoft world are intuitive, fully explained on the lineup sheet and an Options sheet furnished with each set, and have a relatively slight learning curve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Almost every season is available back to 1901.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
