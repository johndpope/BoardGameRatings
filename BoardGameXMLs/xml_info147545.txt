			<description>A gambling game played during Colonial times in the US.  It plays with 2 standard dice and is similar to Craps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The roller first rolls to establish their target number, rerolling until they get 5/6/7/8/9.  Then there is a special roll, on which there are extra instant-win and instant-loss values.  Then there is a roll to determine the hazard number (rerolling if the target number comes up).  Then the roller keeps rolling until they hit their target (and win) or the hazard (and lose).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the special second roll, there are extra rules:&lt;br/&gt;- if you roll your target number, you win&lt;br/&gt;- if you roll 12, you win if your target number is 8&lt;br/&gt;- if you roll 11, you win if your target number is 7&lt;br/&gt;- if you roll 2 or 3, you lose&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The odds are stacked solidly in the roller's favor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
