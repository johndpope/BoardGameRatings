			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Odds On Card Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Odds On is the dice and card game where the players decide the odds and the dice decide the outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has seven specially numbered horse cards. Just like in real horse racing, some of the horse cards are better than others - you have to decide which you think are the best and what their chances are of winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A &amp;quot;seven plus&amp;quot; horse card means you need to throw a seven or more on the dice - an odds card of &amp;quot;four&amp;quot; gives you four attempts to do it. Succeed and you're on a winner, fail and you've lost one of your horse cards and your opponent could be one step nearer the winning post.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most winning horses is the champion in this exciting game of luck and skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Pack of Horse Cards&lt;br/&gt;     Pack of Odds Cards&lt;br/&gt;     2 Dice&lt;br/&gt;     Rules Inside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Devised by Michael Kindred and Malcolm Goldsmith&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Listed as Ages 8 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
