							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Urbania: Subsidy Contracts</name>
									
			<description>SETUP: Take a subsidy contract tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RENEW: You may use your subsidy contract tile to add one worker to the total number of workers committed to renewing a building.  This is a rainbow colored worker and can be used as a worker of any color.  If used for a worker then you must discard this tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIRE: You may use your subsidy contract tile to add one coin to the total number of coins needed to hire a specialist.  This is a rainbow colored coin and can be used as a coin of any color.  If used for a coin then you must discard this tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ITALIAN POLITICS VARIANT: The subsidy contract tile has 2 sides, active and inactive.  It begins the game with its active side up.  When you use it flip it over to its inactive side.  For the rest of the game, if you lose control of a specialist (someone buys it from you), flip the subsidy contract tile back to its active side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
