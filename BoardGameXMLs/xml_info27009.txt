			<description>Simple spin-and-move game distinguished only by presentation. The pawns are lead figures designed to resemble television cameras. The backdrop to the gameboard has pop-up figures giving the gameboard a 3-D effect. The game comes with a xylophone that must be played or the participant who misses the cue is penalized. The first to reach the finish space is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An unusual place on the GameBoard is the Station Break Area which is represented by clock symbols. If you land on or pass over one of these Station Breaks you must ring the TIME SIGNAL TONES to properly identify the network. If you fail to do so you must move your camera back 15 spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
