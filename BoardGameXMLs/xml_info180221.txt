							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Urban Park</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 48 x 40 inch Battlemap of an Urban Park, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;You show me the money and the meteorite is yours. You want me to open the case to see the rock? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure we should do that. &amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;Geologist Andrew Perkins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Urban Park is an exterior map of a triangular-shaped city park in the middle of a city with a factory to the northwest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Urban Park is intended for use in modern or near future science fiction games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure idea for this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meteor for Sale: The urban park was once one of the most beautiful spots in the entire city. Now factories pollute the air and imposing skyscrapers loom over the park making it seem small in comparison. The ancient park is now used by the criminal elements in town for drug deals and other nefarious negotiations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A geologist named Andrew recently found a meteorite in a small crater near his house. He has studied the rock and believes it has an element of alien origin inside. Being poor, he has decided to sell the meteor to one of the CEOs of the factories in town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CEO and Andrew meet in the Urban Park at night. The CEO shows him the cash in a briefcase and demands to see the rock. The geologist opens the containment case reluctantly. The once whole meteor now has a crack in it from transporting it over a long distance that reveals a green glow. The radioactivity of the rock causes many effects in the park. Humans that come in contact with the rock spontaneously combust in a conflagration of green flame, devolve into apes, or remain human with super powers given by the rock. Animals and insects in the park grow gigantic (think giant pigeons and giant ants).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Andrew devolves into a giant ape and attacks the CEO. When he instinctively moves his hands to block, a barrier comes up that blocks the blow. The CEO&amp;rsquo;s men immolate in green fire. The CEO uses his newfound powers to knock out the changed Andrew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters can be police or detectives monitoring the park for criminal activities at night. They could also be innocent bystanders such as bums squatting in the park, bicyclists and drivers passing the park, factory or office workers leaving for home after work, etc. The group is given super powers by the meteorite but have to deal with the various threats in the Urban Park also created by the meteor&amp;rsquo;s radioactivity. The CEO grabs the briefcase and containment case and attempts to get away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
