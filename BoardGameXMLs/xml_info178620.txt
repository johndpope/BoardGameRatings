							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rescuer Game</name>
									
			<description>A little girl is left alone on the topn of a burning hill and the fire is raging. She is in danger! the rescuers must climb up to the top of the hilltop to save her as fast as possible. But, the mission is not easy. They must watch out for the burning wood and be careful not to lose their way on the hill. Otherwise they will be slowed down, while the time is running out!! The perfect dice game for little ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play:&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes turns to roll a multi coloured dice, then move their rescuer to the next space on the board which matches that colour. If a '?' is rolled, that player must draw a card from the deck and follow the instructions; e.g move forward/backwards x spaces, swap places with another player etc... If a player lands on a fire, they miss a turn while they extinguish the flames. The first player to get to the top of the hill, rescues the little girl and is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
