							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gter Ma</name>
									
			<description>In Gter Ma, you play one of two sides: a thief who is trying to steal a gter ma (an ancient Tibetan Buddhist teaching) from a monastery or the lone monk who is trying to protect it with the help of his trusty, if a bit senile, Tibetan mastiff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you play as the thief, you&amp;rsquo;ll be trying to sneak through the tall grasses into the monastery in the dead of night when the monks are all asleep, tiptoe past the guard dog who isn&amp;rsquo;t as vigilant as he used to be, and steal the gter ma from inside. Then, you&amp;rsquo;ll sneak back out and sell those sacred teachings for as much as possible on the open market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you play as the monk, you&amp;rsquo;ll be trying to stop the thief from making it into the monastery by laying traps&lt;br/&gt;on the front lawn. Being a devout pacifist, though, none of your traps will harm the thief - but they will make enough noise to rouse the attention of your very old guard dog, who will then fiercely protect the door, making entrance impossible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download the game for free here: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://bit.ly/121IEBx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://bit.ly/121IEBx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
