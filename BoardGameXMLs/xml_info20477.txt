			<description>&lt;br/&gt;'FireFights!' scenarios are small, intense scenarios compatible with the ASL game system or any other tactical level wargame. All aspects of the game system are covered - with infantry, armor and artillery set in a variety of terrain and theatres.&lt;br/&gt;Variety and re-playability are key components of FireFight Packs. Each scenario has a variable Order of Battle and most have variable entry turns and reinforcements. The reinforcements, when received, are historically accurate as to equipment available to that particular unit while it was in combat. Fog of war is also enhanced through set up and Scenario Variables. As a bonus each FireFight scenario comes with its own historically based 8 1/2 by 11 inch map for playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Advanced Squad Leader&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
