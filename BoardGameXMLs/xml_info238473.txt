							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Witch</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1209, in the village of Strohm, a woman was suspected of being beyond redemption. The locals, unable to deal with her wickedness, professed she was a witch in league with Satan and asked the local clergy to remove her to a place where the demons could be excised and destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though accusing (and subsequently punishing) someone of witchcraft was outlawed, the church agreed to intervene for the good of the community. It was decided the woman would be taken to a cathedral where the bishop can judge her well-being. And determine her fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What was needed; sturdy men to safeguard the woman and lead her safely to her judgment&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Witch, players take on the roles of guardians escorting a woman who has been accused of being evil to a cathedral where the bishop decides how best to deal with her. The story takes place on the road, with the finale taking place in or near the cathedral town of Luitgarde.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: This mini version of the Praxis game requires players to own at least one other Praxis game or know the rules to Praxis. This PDF only includes an introduction, characters, and story milestones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
