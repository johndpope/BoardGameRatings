							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Insult Bingo</name>
									
			<description>Using web based or software based bingo card generators, players create bingo cards filled with various vulgarities and insults.  (Many card generators are widely available that will create random cards from a wordlist) Players conceal their bingo card from others during the game. During their turn players will shout insults at another player who then has to mark off any that are on his/her bingo card. The length of the insult/vulgarity string can be varied for what each group enjoys.  Players who get a &amp;quot;Bingo&amp;quot; are out of the game.  Play continues until one player remains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Varients include any of the standard &amp;quot;Bingo&amp;quot; varients.&lt;br/&gt;Best enjoyed with an easygoing group with an open mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
