			<description>A very light and simple two players card game by Bruno Faidutti, it has been published successively, each time with some additions and developmenst, in the French magazines Sciences &amp;amp; Vie D&amp;eacute;couverte (1999), then in the Japanese boardgame magazine Gamelink (2011), and last in the French comics magazine Lanfeust, in 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Battle of Gods is a variation on the good old game of War, which tries to add some subtleties, both with tactics and bluffing.&lt;br/&gt;The first new idea is that cards are played in pairs. First, each player plays a card. Cards are revealed, and then each player plays a second one, and their values are added. This makes for some interesting dilemmas.&lt;br/&gt;The second new idea is that there are 6 sets of 12 cards, for six different mythologies. In each game, each player plays a different mythology. In each set, two or three cards have special effects when played, making for interesting combos and even more bluffing.&lt;br/&gt;It's a two player game, but the six available mythologies make for 15 different possible duels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
