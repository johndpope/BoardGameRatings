							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SPL Battlegrounds: The Legends Edition</name>
									
			<description>SPL Battlegrounds: Legends Edition allows you to build the systems of car audio legends like Alma Gates, the Grandmother of car audio! The objective of this game is to have a blast building the systems of car audio legends using the cards in your hand, the cards you draw, or the cards you 'buy'. The challenge is to be the one at the end of the hand and ultimately, the end of the game, who has racked up the highest score. Scoring in this game is calculated by db (decibels) as measured in car audio competitions as the SPL (sound pressure level) of your system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suitable for children under 12 with adult assistance, and crazy fun for the whole family! Customize your fun by setting your own time, goal or scoring limits. Each Legend's card offers unique legendary abilities such as drawing 4 cards per turn instead of three, reducing the cost of buying class cards, or allowing you to fish cards from the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt a hand of cards and can take a number of actions on their turn such as drawing cards from the draw deck and discard pile, buying a class card / legendary card to build on, buying a 2x amplifier card, building on a class, closing a class and ending a turn by discarding. As you move along in the game you add subwoofers and amplifiers to complete your system and close it out,gaining bonus points for each build you've completed. Once the draw deck runs out, players add up their points to see who is the champion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created by car audio guru Donald Hebig (dBDon) and his wife Ferne (Nerfblat), the world's first and only car audio card game is a great way to share a love for car audio with family and friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
