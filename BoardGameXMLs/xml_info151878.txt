							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Red Tape Tavern</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 32 x 30 inch, full color floorplan of an upper class tavern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Hex, Square and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;What these etchings and paintings behind me? Just meaningless art by the original creator of the inn, pay them no mind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Red Tape Tavern is a single map of the ground floor of a posh inn so named for its tendency to be used by bureaucrats, diplomats, merchants, and other higher-class clientele and its multiple tapestries hanging from the ceiling. The Red Tape Tavern includes a 360-degree panoramic view of the inn from the perspective of the center of the room near the bar stools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Red Tape Tavern is intended for use in fantasy games. The inn can also be used in a modern game for an inn with a retro feel. The 360-degree view also has some wall etchings that may give it some Horror appeal as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Night Deals: The Red Tape Tavern is known for as a place where deals are made at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Bureaucrats, diplomats, merchants, and nobles make business deals and political agreements here all day long. What they don&amp;rsquo;t know is that behind the tapestries, the Unseen sees all that occurs. The Unseen subtly guides these deals and agreements, always making sure they will be broken, forcing the all the patrons to return day after day. The Unseen was trapped in the inn by the original creator of the Red Tape Tavern, an engineer and artist slowly driven insane by the Unseen, but gained a measure of vengeance by sealing him in the inn before his death. The Unseen wishes only to cause madness and chaos. The Unseen has been working his way into the minds of the people who run the inn, especially the bartender and servers. They have become his newest cult and he is instructing them in the occult. The Unseen prepares for the day when his followers finally figure out a way to break the sculptor&amp;rsquo;s seal and return to the world to cause real havoc once again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters could end up staying the night on that fateful occasion. The followers of the Unseen attempt to kidnap inn patrons and the player characters to their dark god. If the player characters fight them off, they find the other cultists downstairs with the other inn patrons in tow. They remove the painting behind the bar, revealing a disturbing miasma of wisplike tentacles with a centralized distinguishing feature, a single, circular eye similar to the etchings in the tapestry. The cultists sacrifice the inn patrons, weakening the seal, and the Unseen&amp;rsquo;s tentacles grapple and crush some of its own followers, finishing the occult ritual. The player characters either need to fight the Unseen and its mad followers or try to escape the inn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
