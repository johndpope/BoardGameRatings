			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the heart of Pittsburgh lies a fabulous new arena known as Three Rivers Coliseum. It is the largest and most advanced facility of its kind, and host to the largest crawl ever held in the North American Empire, promising prizes far beyond anything ever offered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heading up this new event is a mysterious figure calling himself DJ Phantom. Little is know of this man, except that he was hand picked by the city&amp;rsquo;s Mayor, Lord Duke Stratford.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And behind the walls of the Coliseum, and in the heart of the DJ are things that no one could possibly expect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three Rivers Crawl is a massive campaign style crawl that serves as a perfect bridge from Division Three to Division Two. What&amp;rsquo;s more, it is also a sourcebook on the city of Pittsburgh, providing details on the major players of the city and the political machinations behind it all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included inside are new monsters, new feats, and an all-new core character class, The Paramedic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t some penny-ante crawl, this is the big time. Do you have what it takes to survive? And can you face the truth of what lies within?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
