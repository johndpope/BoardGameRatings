			<description>Bench Coach Baseball is a game which keeps track of a pitcher's pitch count. Each batter is rated for his swinging at the first pitch, going ahead of the count, falling behind, or hitting with two strikes.  Rules are simple and game is based on 1-200 chances to hit or make an out.  Results are generated from three dice:  a green 20-sided die, and a blue and red six-sided die. A pitcher who consistently fall behind the count will tire more quickly and get hit harder than a pitcher who remains ahead of the hitters. Pitchers are also rated on their ability to hold runners. There is also rules for hit and out location, and sacrifice bunts. Game includes a pitch-count sheet, rules, stadium factors and individual players with their own player cards, like APBA and Strat-o-Matic. The cards for this game are not as aesthetically pleasing as the Strat-O cards or the newer APBA baseball cards:  just cardstock with heavy black numbers and letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main distributor for Adam Games is Taylor Marketing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
