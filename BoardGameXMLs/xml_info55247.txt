							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Napoleon&#039;s Grande Armee</name>
									
			<description>Richard Berg follows up Chainmail with NAPOLEON&amp;rsquo;S GRANDE ARMEE. The game will use the Chainmail card system to recreate four exciting battles that follow one of the greatest military leaders of all time. No dice and no charts. The battles included will be Austerlitz, Lutzen, Wagram, and Ligny. The game will include a map, counters, rules, and cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses cards, one deck for each player (whose cards are somewhat different from those of the other player) to drive the game. Each player gets a certain number of cards each turn - but never his full deck. The cards are used to determine movement, combat, and actions. is thus a game of card play and management, which unfolds on the historical battle map - it uses squares, rather than hexes with the use of some beautiful, super-size counters. No dice are used. And there are no CRT&amp;rsquo;s. Skill determines the outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
