							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mardi&#039;s Space Travel Game</name>
									
			<description>Players are the space explorers searching the galaxy for new planets and picking alien creatures along the way.  Players roll dice to move around the circular board in order to explore different locations or places.  Upon arrival at a planet, they draw a danger card to see what happens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was created by a local company in Concord, NC.  It seems to have only been produced locally in that area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
