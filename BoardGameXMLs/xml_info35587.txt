			<description>Biznes po europejsku - &amp;quot;Business in an European way&amp;quot; - is a Monopoply-based game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players buy properties located in various European countries, grouped by their region (e.g. Germany with Austria; Belgium with Holland and Luxembourg; Greece with Cyprus and Malta, Poland with Slovakia and Hungary etc.). There are 10 sets total: 7 of 3 countries and 3 of 2 ones; they all fit on the board as it is 4 squares bigger than the one of Monopoly. The banknotes are one-sided copies of the Euro notes. The game is not an exact clone of Monopoly but the gameplay  is really very close to the Monopoply one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
