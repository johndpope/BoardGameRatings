			<description>Superman is an arcade game released by Taito Corporation in 1988, featuring popular DC Comics character Superman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes control of Superman, who must fight through five levels to make the world safe from the evil Emperor Zaas. The first player takes control of the traditional blue Superman, while the second player takes control of a red Superman with a grey cape. The title starts out in Metropolis before going to San Francisco, Las Vegas and Washington, D.C. Superman is able to punch, kick and fly. He can also use a projectile &amp;quot;Sonic Blast&amp;quot; attack when the player holds down then releases the punch button. There are also objects in the levels he can throw and/or break. Some of these objects release crystals that can restore Superman's energy, allow the player to throw one projectile attack without charging or defeat all the enemies on the screen. The first four levels have three-parts - a side-scrolling part, followed by a vertically scrolling flying part and a final side-scrolling shooter part where Superman uses heat vision instead of kicking and can destroy or dodge obstacles such as rocks. Each part has a boss at the end. The final level, the main boss' spaceship, adds a side-scrolling shooting section to the beginning and an extra final boss fight at the end. Throughout much of the game the &amp;quot;Superman Main Theme&amp;quot; from the Superman films plays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Superman (arcade game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
