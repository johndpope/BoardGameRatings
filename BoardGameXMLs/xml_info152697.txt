							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stupid &amp; Overpowered 2</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in rpgs often have abilities are not tied to their class, race or skill, although they may be related/useful to it. These are called Feats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They may be combat related, a way to tweak spells or even to do with the crafting of an item. Some will be useful to almost everyone, others only in very certain circumstances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This edition of &amp;ldquo;Fantastic Feats&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; a series of feats based around a certain theme or subject &amp;ndash; is the 2nd in the Stupid &amp;amp; Overpowered feats range. These feats are for villains and npcs and not really suitable for players or serious games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The feats you'll find inside:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Excellent!&lt;br/&gt;     I'll get you next time!&lt;br/&gt;     Is this the face of someone who cares?&lt;br/&gt;     Jelly Bean?&lt;br/&gt;     MWahahahah&lt;br/&gt;     You got me monologging!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
