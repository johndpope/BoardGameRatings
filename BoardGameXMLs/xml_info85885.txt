			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: I sunder the barbarian's axe, disarming him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: Alright, just give me a moment as I look this up. (Flips through the book for several minutes.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: Nevermind, I&amp;rsquo;ll just stab him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a scene familiar to any Game Master. Your players choose to take a non-standard action and the game grinds to a halt as you look up the rules. Players get bored waiting, the mood drifts away, and random conversation and jokes ensue. Well, have no fear, Healing Fireball Publications has your answer. The Combat Cards: Special Tactics are a collection of easy to print and use reference cards that cover all the most common non-standard actions. From Aiding Another to Disarming to Charging &amp;ndash; they're all here. We even provide two large double-sided cards that cover the intricacies of Mounted Combat and the dreaded Grappling. Never search for a rule again with Combat Cards - the rules are at your fingertips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
