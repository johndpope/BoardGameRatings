			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wild West is a very simple role-playing game that focuses almost exclusively on firearms combat during the frontier period of the American West.  Characters have four Attributes (Strength, Stamina, Smarts, and Speed) and have ten dice distributed among them, with a minimum of 1D and a maximum of 4D.  These dice are rolled as a pool whenever the character attempts some action with that Attribute.  Characters also have one or more Skills among which thirteen dice are distributed.  The game lists eleven &amp;quot;Primary Skills&amp;quot; which must utilize at least seven dice.  Characters may have any Secondary Skill the player desires.  Most Primary Skills deal with combat:  Six Shooter, Rifle, Blade, Fists, Ride, Lasso, Whip, Tracking, Stealth, Ingine Speak, and Gambling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action resolution is performed by rolling a D6 dice pool based on either a Skill or an Attribute.  Odd results are considered successes.  Combat works essentially the same way though it transpires in rounds of limited time and supports initiative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A printable character sheet in RTF format also is available for download.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
