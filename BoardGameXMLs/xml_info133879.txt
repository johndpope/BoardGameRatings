							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Joker of Spades</name>
									
			<description>A Joker was sent to prison because he called the queen fat. He's had a week to think about it, and he's decided to try to break out. The game uses the Aces and Faces to create the board. Aces represent traps, while Kings, Queens, and Jacks represent guards. The goal of the game is to find the Ace of Spades, a powerful and intricate trap like none other. It's the only exit from the dungeons the Joker can take if he wants to live out the rest of his life in freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by a simple layout of cards in a 4 by 4 square. The joker starts in the bottom left corner, and moves one card at a time. Each card represents a room, each room contains a guard or trap. Using the number cards in your hand to match the values on each trap or guard's room, you can deal with each room accordingly. The goal is to find the Ace of spades among the rooms and disarm the trap it represents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
