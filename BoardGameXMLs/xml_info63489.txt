			<description>On their turn, Spin-Jenny has players spin a top in the center of a round, concave board containing nine holes, each assigned a different  colour and value from 0-8. There are nine coloured wooden balls, free to move on the board, which are scattered by the top when it is spun. Points are scored according to the number assigned to a hole in which a ball has been scored. Double the points are awarded if a ball has scored on the hole of the same colour. If all balls score in one spin, a 20 point bonus is added. The winner is the first player to reach a predetermined score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
