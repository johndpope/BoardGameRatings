							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Death Ride Salerno: 16th Panzer Expansion</name>
									
			<description>Death Ride Salerno - 16th Panzer Expansion is the third, of four, title in the Death Ride Salerno game set.  This game expands the beachhead to the east and introduces British forces from the 10th Corps.  The main battle in this part of the bridgehead was for Battipaglia.  The British Guard Brigade managed to get into the outskirts of the town only to be thrown out.  The front in this area was fairly settled for the 6 days of the battle and the Germans did not have the stregnth here to push the British back.  The German counter-attack instead focused on the American forces and ultimately fell short.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Naval gunfire support is present in the British area along with significant air support.  A new Naval Chart is included in this game that helps to organize the naval gunfire ships off shore and even takes into account ships needing to come out of the support line to conduct resupply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game system rules are written along the Seven Battlefield Operating Systems of Maneuver, Command and Control, Fire Support, Intelligence, Air Defense, Mobility and Survivability, and Combat Service Support.  Enhancements to those plus an Amphibious Enhancement are planned for future release.  A Fire Support Artillery Enhancement has already been released and provides for artillery mission markers that restrict artillery support to Direct Support (DS), General Support (GS), and Reinforcing (R).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
