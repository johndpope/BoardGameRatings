			<description>A tabletop game for up to 4 players ages 8 and up. It is Halloween night and you have to get as many of your trick-or-treaters back home to safety while avoiding getting killed by the very real vampires who are out hunting in your neighborhood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a set of pawns representing your trick-or-treaters and 3 dice that match color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, take your dice and one die from an opponent of your choice. Roll them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rolling 1, 2, 3 means you can move your trick-or-treaters that number of spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rolling V1 or V2 allows you to move the vampires that number of spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the + side of the die is rolled, take a die from another player and roll it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The opponent&amp;rsquo;s die is treated differently than the player&amp;rsquo;s own dice. 1, 2, 3 you move your opponent&amp;rsquo;s trick-or-treater that number of spaces. You cannot move the opponent&amp;rsquo;s t-o-t to the same space as a vampire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the V1 or V2 is rolled, your opponent gets to move a vampire. Vampires can only be moved once on your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the + is rolled it is treated the same as above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WINNING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all trick-or-treaters have been saved (made it to the center space) or killed by vampires, the game is over. The player with the most safe trick-or-treaters wins. Ties are possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is also possible (though rare) that the vampires can win if no trick-or-traters make it to the center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
