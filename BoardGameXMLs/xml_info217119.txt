							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Day at Fort Endurance</name>
									
			<description>A One-Round Living Greyhawk Gran March Regional Interactive&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The road through the Dim Forest on which Fort Endurance lies is still being widened for military use.  When complete, it will allow the Gran March military to more easily supply Geoff with troops and supplies.  However, construction of the road is behind schedule, in large part due to sabotage.  Some sylvan elves in the forest are apparently unhappy about the road construction, and they have been stealing and damaging equipment in the work camps to the east.  The army has sent road-building specialists here from all across Gran March in an attempt to put this project back on schedule.  The Warden of the Dim March is recruiting scouting parties to assist in those responsible.  Who will show a display of patriotism and valor by assisting in this effort?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Gran March Regional Interactive for characters of all levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
