							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ether Vapor Remaster</name>
									
			<description>ETHER VAPOR Remaster is an overhauled and enhanced version of the original Ether Vapor and was released in Japan on August 13th 2011. Below is an outline of the major changes to the original version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improved Graphics and Sound: The full original game has been ported to the latest Edelweiss-made game engine and graphics and sound reworked for increased impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Resolution Support:  640 x 480 ~ 1600 x 1200 resolution supported. Anti-aliasing (smooths jagged edges caused by polygon limits) functionality added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improved Models and Textures: Ship and background models refined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extra Weapons:  A ship loaded with new weapons has been added. It is tricky to control, but boasts the most powerful firepower of all of the ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remaster Mode Added:  This new mode removes all conversation scenes and places the emphasis on arcade-style game pacing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improved Lighting:  The lighting has been improved to make the enemies easier to see when firing into groups of enemies. This also emphasizes when hits are scored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sound Engine Overhaul:  The richer sound presentation improves in-game immersion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online Leaderboards Added:  High scores now have network functionality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlocking Bonus Content Made Easier:  The &amp;ldquo;Overdrive&amp;rdquo; ship is now available after clearing the game once, rather than clearing the game with no continues used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Option to Hide In-game Story-related Text:  Refers to the conversational Stage 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faster Loading Times:  Virtually no wait during game start or between stages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3D Support: Anaglyph (uses red &amp;amp; blue glasses) 3D mode added. (Ether Vapor makes a lot of use of depth of field, so this is surprisingly effective.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
