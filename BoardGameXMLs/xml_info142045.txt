			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;StarDrive is a 4X Space Strategy game set in a randomly-generated universe, featuring a number of unique races. Colonize planets, build shipyards, and deploy scouts to explore, trade with, and ultimately conquer the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the unique features that sets StarDrive apart is its ship design and combat mechanics, which allow the player to build their own ship blueprints module by module. Unique ship styles can be created, from armed transporters to space stations that aren't stations at all - rather, gigantic orbital weapons platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
