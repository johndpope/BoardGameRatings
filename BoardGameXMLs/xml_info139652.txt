							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game: Yugi and Slifer Card Sleeves</name>
									
			<description>Konami Website Description&lt;br/&gt;Slifer the Sky Dragon is one of the most terrifying and powerful monsters in history! From the very first moment that Slifer appeared before Yugi, its place in Dueling history was secure. Long before that, Yugi&amp;rsquo;s shocking victory over Seto Kaiba cemented his legacy as the King of Games, even before a single card was played at Duelist Kingdom. When these two unstoppable forces combined, nothing in the world could beat them, and now you can harness some of that power for your own with the Yugi &amp;amp; Slifer Card Sleeves!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon Card Sleeves before them, each sleeve captures the essence of one of the greatest forces in all of Dueling to keep your cards protected for hours and hours of Dueling action. Unlike many of his opponents, Yugi always took the utmost care of his cards, and they took care of him in return. Now you can follow the example of the greatest Duelist of all time with these high-quality card sleeves!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each pack contains 50 tournament-legal sleeves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
