			<description>The Horus Heresy Book Four &amp;ndash; Conquest, lavishly illustrated in full colour, contains extensive background information on Warmaster Horus&amp;rsquo; invasion of the northern Imperium after the revelation of his treachery at the Isstvan System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, this book contains details of the Solar Auxilia of the Imperial Army and the histories of four Knight Households, as well as two entirely new army lists. The Questoris Knight Crusade Army list enables you to field a full Household of towering Knights armed with devastating weapons of mass destruction, whilst the Solar Auxilia Crusade Army list brings the elite of the Imperial Army to your battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book also contains an extensive campaign system which includes alternative Force Organisation charts, new City Fighting and Strategic Raid mission types, new battlefield terrain, options for character advancement and relics of the Dark Age of Technology for every Crusade era army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Horus Heresy Book IV: Conquest is a complete expansion for the Warhammer 40,000 game and can be used independently of the previous Horus Heresy expansion books; it only requires the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
