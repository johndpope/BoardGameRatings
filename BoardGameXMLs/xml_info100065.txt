			<description>THE COMPLETE ICONICA SERIES TWO&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a stunning turn of events, a group of noble Sarion have defied the tyranny of their government and the Legion Agenda. Now they are mortal enemies of their former kinsmen who consider them traitors. Taking up residence in a region known as Sanctum, these defectors (called Saraja or &amp;quot;a people remade&amp;quot;) have allied themselves with the Protectorate and seek a new life living in harmony with the native races of Rynaga.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new series features six Sanctum themed characters loyal to the Protectorate. Each is identified with a special shield which represents their values as a people. You'll also discover formidable new Legion and Independent characters to employ in your Iconica contests!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT ICONICA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iconica is a game of turn-based strategy with RPG elements. You'll like Iconica if you:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. like games in which you're faced with choices (and some chance)&lt;br/&gt;2. want layers of complexity without reading 45 pages of rules &lt;br/&gt;3. like teaming up with friends during games&lt;br/&gt;4. want a NEW experience in fictional setting&lt;br/&gt;5. want a game where there are no junk/duplicate/fodder cards&lt;br/&gt;6. like games with a rich backstory&lt;br/&gt;7. like games with RPG flavor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DETAILS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iconica Character Cards are professionally printed in small print runs. The game is independently written, illustrated and designed by myself. The Iconica Series Two Box Set ships in a reusable box and includes the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; 22 Iconica Character Cards (character #23-44, depicted in the photos)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; 1 Iconica Quick Reference card&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; 1 pair of dice&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; 2 sets of game pieces&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; 2-player and 4-player Iconica rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
