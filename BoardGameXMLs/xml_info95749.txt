			<description>Do you get sick of zombie games and fart apps flooding the App Store?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colonel John Farter is an American officer who spent seven years in a North Vietnamese POW camp, then escaped. He just recently came back, and discover his town full of zombies and his only weapon is his ass. He mets up with his old friend Banana Max and together, they will launch a mission to free the town from The Evil Unicorn and his army of zombies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Farts VS Zombies you have to kill zombies with farts, you draw with the finger the path of the farts and direct them to their faces. The game goal is to protect the japanese schoolgirls from the attack of the zombies as much time as possible. In fact, zombies hate farts, it&amp;rsquo;s the only thing that can kill them, well - not the only one really. But the game is more than that, you can do Fart Combos, use funny Special Attacks and items and compete in online rankings with your friends to see who is the best farter!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
