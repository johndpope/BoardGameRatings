			<description>From the website &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.tsoa.be/html/titelblad_uk_medieval.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.tsoa.be/html/titelblad_uk_medieval.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DESIGNER'S NOTES:&lt;br/&gt;This is the fourth set in my card driven wargame rules, and although still loosely inspired by the Battle Cry &amp;amp; Memoir '44 games by Richard Borg, the game no longer has a battlefield divided in 3 sections. Battlefield sections are great for ACW and WWII, but medieval battles need a different approach. The left-center-right wing Battle Cry/Memoir '44 principle has here been replaced by color-coding the units red, green and blue (activated by cards of the same color) thus enabling the players to concentrate their units anywhere on the battlefield if they wish so. Also, quality of armor plays a prominent role in medieval battles. Therefore the symbols on the dice are no longer representing infantry - cavalry - artillery but rather the quality of the armor of the troops targeted, whereby troops with heavier armor stand less of a chance of being killed than soldiers with lighter or no armor (see rules).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
