			<description>A Sourcebook for Non-Adventuring Activities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deities of Pekal are a diverse group who watch over the intelligent races in all of Tellene. Each culture has their own names for these gods and their own way of worshipping them. Some gods have multiple names and temples even within the same culture. In Pekal, as in the rest of Tellene, worship of a god is defined by the temple organization. In Living Kingdoms of Kalamar, all organized worship is done through the temple organizations in Pekal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Service to a temple and study of its precepts is commonly expected of all members, from the lowest acolyte to the highest priest. Advancement in a temple is typically based upon both completion of service and knowledge of the temple&amp;rsquo;s dogma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Temples in Pekal are required by law to maintain a relationship with the College of Magic to restrict the use of magic within the Principality. The College allows temples of accepted faiths to govern their own members in the creation of magical items, provided that the temples follow the College&amp;rsquo;s guidelines and restrictions. Members and allies of the religious organizations use those rules for creating magical items rather than those of the College of Magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
