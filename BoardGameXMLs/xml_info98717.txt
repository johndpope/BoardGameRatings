							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Table Speedway</name>
									
			<description>A table motorcycle racing game, developed by Peter Adolph, the inventor of Subbuteo. The components used Subbuteo style bases, but instead of soccer/football players, the figures depicted were motorcycle riders. The game used a ball baring, launched from a tube, to propel the riders around the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was one of four games in a series. The other games in the series were: Motor Racing, Horse Racing, and Cycle Speedway. Each of the games were very similar, with only a few minor variations to reflect the sport being represented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to Peter Upton's website, the advertising copy for the game described gameplay thusly:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The patented apparatus enables the reproduction of different gear ratios to be selected... Machine somersaults and overslides, Bumping, track records and lap dashes are all contained in the game... as in real Speedway - the rider who can follow the white line and gates successfully is generally the winner&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
