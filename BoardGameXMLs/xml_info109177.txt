			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blood and Vengeance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A missing shadowrunner. An artifact with mysterious, blood-fed powers. And astral beings with horrible grudges. All of these elements&amp;mdash;and more&amp;mdash;are coming together to give shadowrunners a long day and a longer night, as they move from trying to find what has been lost to struggling for their survival. And with what they&amp;rsquo;re up against, survival would be a very notable accomplishment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you have played previous Missions in Season Four or are just now diving into this plotline, SRM 04-10: Romero and Juliette provides a test for any group of shadowrunners while also increasing the intensity of the hunt for artifacts in Seattle. This one will give runners a story to tell over the next round of drinks, as long as they an stay alive long enough to buy one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SRM 04-10: Romero and Juliette is for use with Shadowrun, Twentieth Anniversary Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous information from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artifact Rush, Part 5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Halloween in Seattle, and the ghosts and ghouls are out in force. A researcher and the artifact he&amp;rsquo;s studying go missing, and her boyfriend hires the runners to track him down. Meanwhile, in morgues around the city, the recently dead have gone missing. Coincidence? This is Shadowrun, there are no coincidences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
