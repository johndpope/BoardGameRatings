							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">From Aspern to Wagram</name>
									
			<description>Using the new Napoleonic version of the ACW operational March into Battle system from Corinth and Hampton Newsome's At All Hazards, this game portrays the two largest battles of the 1809 campaign: Aspern, Napoleon's first defeat, and Wagram, the fourth largest battle of the Napoleonic Wars (and, as Massena put it, at that time the largest battle in history where one person could overlook the whole battlefield).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a system that lets armies and units behave in historical fashion but makes it possible to play these multi-day battles in a couple of hours, this is an army commander's view of how to conclude a campaign.  Fatigue, morale, supply and command are as important as fighting prowess and sheer numbers.  Units not just take physical losses but will become ineffective from fatigue and disorder long before they run out of men - unless you, in command, can manage them effectively and maintain their edge over two days of fighting.  Corps are normally activated by chitpulls, but for PBEM play a less interactive version is provided that still provides a significant advantage to the side that grabs the initiative in the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map scale: 1km per hex&lt;br/&gt;Unit scale: divisions, 1000 men per strength point&lt;br/&gt;Time scale: 3.5 hours per daylight turn, 8 hours per night turn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
