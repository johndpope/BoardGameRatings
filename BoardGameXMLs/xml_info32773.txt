							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bombers Aloft</name>
									
			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four lanes of travel.  The first spin selects the lane of travel.   Player 1 spins again and sets the bomber's altitude.  The nose of the bomber is placed in the metal stand provided at the height noted. A third spin gives the movement value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AA gun spins next (2 times to set the lane and altitude).   If they match the lane and height of the bomber it is brought down.  Each player follows in succession with a bomber and then the AA gun's attack.  If the AA score a kill it gets points based on the zone the bomber is in and its altitude.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lanes contain spaces with numbers (from 1 to 14) that reference the hit on the score card. The value is recorded as part of the score.  Any plane that comes to a &amp;quot;Change Altitude&amp;quot; space spins the spinner for a new altitude.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all bombers have been shot down or have reached the finish line.  The player with the largest score is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
