							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Caesar in Gaul</name>
									
			<description>This game was initially intended to be an expansion to Avalon Hill's Caesar's Legions. It has turned into much more than that. It has so many distinct features to it, the only recognizable part that remains are the counters. Caesar's Legions was a captivating game and pretty successful for Avalon Hill. It broke the mold of their traditional WWII games and the traditional combat chart that they used. There were two short comings with the game - there were only five scenarios, and there was no campaign game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Caesar in Gaul covers a much shorter time period, which makes a campaign game more adaptable. At present it has nine historical scenarios. The rules are more complex as is the combat system, but it remains an intermediate level game, and is highly suited for solitaire play. It has become the sequel game that Caesar's Legions players have always wanted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second Edition rules are released and address all of the criticisms presented to date. They are a free download PDF as well as other charts used in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A computer game for the 4th scenario - Crassus in Aquitania is also available. It gives players a feel for the game mechanics. Useful to play before diving into the scenarios or campaign game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some players have mentioned their hesitance to purchase a board game with a lot of cards in it. The 78 tribal cards are for player reference. It makes locating the various tribes on the board easier, gets you more familiar with the strange tribal names, and instantly identifies resources and leaders available for that tribe. Also useful for random selections when called for, and organizing initial tribal morale in the campaign game set up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
