			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Killer in Shadows is an RPG set in a fantasy world called Qui&amp;uacute;n&amp;eacute;i. Since time immemorial, people in the world have survived time and development, completely unrelated to advances in technology that have been in other places or, rather, on other planes of existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In any universe there are clear laws that govern nature, but it is less clear in Qui&amp;uacute;n&amp;eacute;i. No one remembers  now as it was all in the beginning, only legends and stories to tell in front of a roaring fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, it is a world where the spiritual and divine lives daily with the mundane. All residents are aware of how much they mean their prayers and offerings to the gods, above all, because they have had more than one contact with them in the past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, not only are humans wandering through this world. Also called Ren-Shou and Shou-Qin, live and interact throughout the world. These creatures are specifically credited fully divine origin. But that also makes them fearful among humans who are prone to demonize and persecute anything that does not understand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In any case, magic, gods, fantastic creatures and everyday stories intertwine in this world where our only limit as players is our imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
