							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Universal Adventures The Ruined Keep</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The overgrown trail turned east, ending at a large clearing slowly being reclaimed by the surrounding wilderness.  Large mounds of rubble jutted from the brush.  In the center of the clearing stood a large, stone structure.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Universal Adventures The Ruined Keep is a complete adventure site for use with any fantasy roleplaying game.  The Ruined Keep includes maps of the ruined keep and the dungeon beneath and descriptions of each of the 22 areas that comprise the adventure site.  As a Game Master, all you need to do is assign the monsters and treasures to each of the areas and you are ready to play.  Highly reusable, easily customizable, and fun to play, The Ruined Keep is perfect for an evening&amp;rsquo;s adventure or as part of an ongoing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Portions of The Ruined Keep were part of CM1 Borderlands of Adventure and have been modified and included in this product as part of an adventure suitable for any FRPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
