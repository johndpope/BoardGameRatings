			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once, in the time before the gods forgot their names, when the world was flat and floated on a sea of chaos, there was an age of gleaming cities, untamed wilderness, enlightened devils, greedy spirits, and mighty heroes. This was the age of the Exalted, champions empowered by the highest of gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tomb of Dreams will jumpstart your group&amp;rsquo;s Exalted game &amp;mdash; all you need to start playing Exalted Third Edition is this book, pencils, and 10-sided dice. Included here are the game&amp;rsquo;s core rules, five pregenerated characters, and a self-contained scenario that can start a new campaign or that Storytellers can use in an ongoing chronicle. And for groups that already have the Exalted Third Edition main rulebook, Tomb of Dreams will serve as an introduction for new players and a quick reference during play &amp;mdash; anyone intimidated by that prodigious volume need only read Part 1 of this book to get started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What legends will they tell of your deeds?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
