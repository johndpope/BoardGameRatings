			<description>Memo Fahrzeuge provides entertaining memory fun for 2-4 children ages 2 years and older. Who can remember the positions of the vehicles and collect the most pairs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Did you turn over two of the same vehicle? Excellent! You can take the pair and keep it.  &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;Did you turn over two different vehicles? Too bad, but it's OK! Once everyone has the opportunity to see the vehicle cards you can turn them back over again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End of the game&lt;br/&gt;Have all the pairs been collected? Then all children place their vehicle cards next to each other: The player with the longest vehicle fleet wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
