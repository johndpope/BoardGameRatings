			<description>The Goonies II (グーニーズ2 フラッテリー最後の挑戦, Gūnīzu Tsū: Furatterī Saigo no Chōsen, The Goonies II: The Fratellis' Last Stand) is an adventure game developed and published by Konami for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released on March 18, 1987 (1987-03-18) in Japan, November 1987 in North America, and on December 19, 1988 (1988-12-19) in Europe. It is a sequel to the first Famicom Goonies game, which was only available in North America on PlayChoice-10 arcade units. This led some people to believe that it was supposed to be a sequel to the movie The Goonies which was never produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's story centers on Mikey. His friends, the Goonies, have been kidnapped by the Fratellis, an Italian family of small-time crooks and counterfeiters. Mikey must rescue all six of his friends and free a captured mermaid named Annie who didn't appear in the film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Goonies II,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
