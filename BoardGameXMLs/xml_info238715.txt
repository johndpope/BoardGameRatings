							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kaolan: The Battle Strategy Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Take control of powerful beasts and give them power, then use them to attack your enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kaolan is an exciting trading card battle game. It can be played in four ways: Match Play (single pack), Tournament Play (multiple packs), Power Play (head-to-head), or Single Play (solitaire). All versions use a Master Deck of 60 original cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four kinds of cards: Character Cards, Power Cards, Special Ability Cards, and Opportunity Cards. Booster Cards are also available. The object of the game is to defeat all your opponent's Character Cards by gaining powers and special abilities. Two players challenge each other to a duel with dice until no challengers are left standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to clear your opponent&amp;rsquo;s battlefield of all Character Cards. A battlefield consists of one Leader and up to three Guards. When a player&amp;rsquo;s Character Cards on the battlefield have been eliminated, that player is out of the game. The last remaining player is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play begins by shuffling the cards of the Master Deck. Deal four cards. Arrange these cards on the table so that there is one in front of three cards. Next, deal four cards to each player. The remaining cards become the Draw Pile. If the Draw Pile is empty, shuffle the Discard pile and create a new Draw pile. Turns the four cards on the table face up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, do one of the following options: place a Character Card on the board, draw a card from the Draw Pile, add a Power Card to any Character Card, add a Special Ability to any Character Card, play an Opportunity Card, initiate a Challenge, or pass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the use of dice, players challenge each other to battles. A player is eliminated if all their Character Cards have been defeated. The last remaining player is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
