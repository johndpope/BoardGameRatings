			<description>Children's game based on a 1990 film which in turn is based on Astrid Lindgren's story about Bertil, a boy who befriends Nils, a diminutive person living in a rat's nest under the floor (the previous rat occupant being Nils's landlady and the antagonist of the film).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players take on the role of different instances of Bertil, tasked with collecting doll's house furniture, scraps of food, and matches for firewood in order to furnish Nils's home. This is done by rolling dice or turning over tiles. Hazards include the rat appearing to collect rent (in food), and the neighbour distracting Bertil with games of Pachisi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
