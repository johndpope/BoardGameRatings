							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kill The Plumber</name>
									
			<description>Think of the first time you grabbed a controller and played as a character who rampaged through a world, killing everything in sight.  Have you ever stopped to think how those little guys felt?  Well worry you not...we have the antidote!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Basics - Kill The plumber is a parody to other platformers. Your goal is to stop the 'protagonist' from winning each level. You start off as a slow minion who can't even jump, but has enough power to kill the hero. As you get the hang of it, you start playing as other enemies that can jump, shoot, stomp and even fly, sometimes controlling more than one character at a time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Story - It was a peaceful day in the kingdom, when all of a sudden a Mexican plumber decided to rampage and cause destruction.  No matter what the critters through at him, he kept coming back, and even tried to kidnap their princess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
