			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mad Dog II: The Lost Gold, also called Mad Dog McCree II, was developed and published by American Laser Games in 1994.  Like its predecessor Mad Dog McCree, the game is a light gun shooter where you play a newcomer to town who has to use his six-shooting skills to save the Old West from Mad Dog and his gang.  This time, however, you actually go on the offensive by trying to beat Mad Dog to a gold supply and then you have to return home for what was then advertised as the biggest gun fight in gaming history.  Like its predecessor, Mad Dog II: The Lost Gold is perhaps most famous today for its over-the-top acting and peculiar portrayal of the Old West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was initially released on consoles compatible with FMV technology, which in 1994 consisted of the Sega CD, 3DO, and CD-i.  The game was later ported to the PC.  In 2001, the game was released on an interactive DVD which allowed gamers to play along on their DVD player or on their PlayStation 2 or Xbox.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
