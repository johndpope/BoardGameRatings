			<description>&amp;quot;Deus Ex (abbreviated DX  and pronounced /ˌdeɪ.əs ˈɛks/, DAY-əs-eks) is a cyberpunk-themed action role-playing game developed by Ion Storm Inc. and published by Eidos Interactive in the year 2000, which combines gameplay elements of first-person shooters  with those of role playing games. The game received near-universal critical and industry acclaim, including being named &amp;quot;Best PC Game of All Time&amp;quot; in PC Gamer's Top 100 PC Games  and in a poll carried out by UK gaming magazine  PC Zone.  It was a frequent candidate for and winner of Game of the Year awards,  drawing praise for its pioneering designs in player choice and multiple narrative paths.  It has sold more than 1 million copies, as of April 23, 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in a dystopian world during the 2050s, the central plot follows rookie United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition agent JC Denton, as he sets out to combat terrorist forces, which have become increasingly prevalent in a world slipping ever further into chaos. As the plot unfolds, Denton becomes entangled in a deep and ancient conspiracy, encountering fictional recreations of organizations such as Majestic 12, the Illuminati, and the Hong Kong Triads throughout his journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First published for personal computers running Windows, Deus Ex was later ported to Macintosh systems, as well the PlayStation 2 game console, the latter under the title Deus Ex: The Conspiracy. Loki Games worked on a Linux version of the game, but the company went out of business before releasing it. A sequel to Deus Ex, titled Deus Ex: Invisible War, was released on December 2, 2003 for both Windows and the Xbox video game console. On November 26, 2007, it was confirmed that Square Enix Europe (former Eidos Montreal) is developing a prequel, Deus Ex: Human Revolution.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Deus_Ex_(video_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
