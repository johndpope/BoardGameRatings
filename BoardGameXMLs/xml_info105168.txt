			<description>Captain America: Super Soldier is a third person single player video game loosely based on the film Captain America: The First Avenger. The story of the game takes place during the events of the film, explaining Captain America's adventures aganist the Red Skull and Hydra all over the planet as established in the film&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A significant feature has Chris Evans, Neal McDonough, Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan and J. J. Feild reprising their roles from the film.&lt;br/&gt;Captain America: Super Soldier combines a highly athletic combat system with fluid platforming and a highly tuned suite of shield attacks, as Cap explores a massive castle turned military installation. His shield can be employed in numerous ways: taking out multiple enemies at once, deflecting incoming fire back at enemies, solving puzzles, and scaling walls. Players will be able to launch shield-first into the fray with the superior force of the world's first Super-Soldier at their fingertips and they'll need every bit of that strength to overcome a castle that's both an acrobatic playground for the Captain's physical prowess and a house of mystery with enemies and danger at every turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Captain America: Super Soldier&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
