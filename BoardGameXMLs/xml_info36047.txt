			<description>&amp;ldquo;Fantasy Card game. 2-6 players. Players take the role of Arthurian Knights on the quest for the Holy Grail. Object: The first player to accumulate 7 'Quest' tokens is the winner.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Materials: There are 65 cards in the deck. Players will have to create their own cards in order to play. A six sided die is required to play. 7 'quest tokens' per player are needed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player&amp;rsquo;s turn consists of two to four phases. In the Draw Phase, two cards a drawn. This is followed by the Fate phase, in which the player decides whether or not to quest for the grail. If the player declines to quest, the turn ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player decides to quest, the Adventure Phase comes next. The opponent to the left of the phasing player may play a Test Card. If the phasing player is able to pass the Test, then the other opponents may continue to play Test Cards against the phasing player. This continues until no opponents offer a Test Card. If any Test is failed, the turn ends. If all Tests are met, then the Quest Phase follows. Quests are resolved based on a die roll combined with Aid cards played by the phasing player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you accumulate 7 Quest tokens, than you are deemed worthy to receive the Holy Grail, and you win.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
