							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Long Leg Wins</name>
									
			<description>(From the instructions:)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game is very simple and can be played with young children.  Each of the players will have a great deal of fun as they try to make the longest leg.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User Summary:)&lt;br/&gt;A picture of a boy, without legs, is placed on the table.  Players draw tiles with sections of a leg and a number printed on them.  One or more tiles can be played each turn to extend one of the boy's legs, but may only be played if their values total 7 or 11.  Boot tiles force players to complete their leg, but must also follow the 7-11 rule.  The player who completes the longest leg wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
