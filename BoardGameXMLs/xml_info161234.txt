			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Manse stands, grand and sprawling, mysterious. Beyond the facade, vast potential awaits. What will you make of it..?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landscape: The Manse is a tool designed to support the development of locations of this general type. On just one page it provides 36 map elements, five possible connectors, four tables for further depth, and a host of ideas for potential natures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is compatible with various genres and systems and suitable for use in roleplaying and beyond. It can be used as a source of ready layouts for specific locations, as well as to inspire, arrange and detail locations, even at the table in the course of games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map elements can be used at the given scale, possibly with 1:285 (6mm) scale miniatures, or redrawn as required in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two pages are arranged for ease of use on screen or printed, the key features occupying a single page. The tool includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     36 map elements arranged in six groups of six, all on one page&lt;br/&gt;     five suggested connecting elements, one for each element type&lt;br/&gt;     four tables - for orientation, doors, landscape beyond and stairs&lt;br/&gt;     18 proposals for the overarching nature of the entire complex&lt;br/&gt;     a large number of suggestions for individual element natures&lt;br/&gt;     a compact diceless number generator for the specific range used&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tool can be used with Narrative: Abandoned Space, the map elements acting as a setting or structure for development, as well as with Elaboration: Structure &amp; Surface, which provides 540 descriptive terms for adding more detail to locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
