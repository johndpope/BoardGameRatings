			<description>Publisher's Description:&lt;br/&gt;This is the first in a trilogy of inter-galactic adventure game-books. It has 300 numbered sections and the reader plays the part of the main character - similar to Wizard book's Fighting Fantasy series. 2 dice and a pencil are needed to play. Synopsis: Dare you take on the might of the Empire to free your home planet from its clutches? You are an intergalactic Hauler who is inadvertently enlisted in the ranks of a secret rebellion operating on your once free home-world and preparing to begin a drive to free it from tyranny. Your world is one of the last to be conquered by a formidable galactic administration which has turned itself swiftly and secretively into a despotic empire. This is a perilous adventure and it may take you a few attempts to successfully complete. It is also fast-paced and exciting and is a great way to get kids of 10 and up to read a book, but also aimed at adults who love role-playing-games and inter-active gamebooks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
