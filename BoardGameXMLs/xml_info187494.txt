			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We like to support our GMs by ans wering questions and supplying them with resources and guidance, and have long felt that a completely GM-focused product would be a great addition to the 13th Age line. We hope the tools included with the Game Master&amp;rsquo;s Screen and Resource Book serve you well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our goal for the screen is to provide useful tables, charts, and reminders to keep your game running smoothly by providing the information you ne ed, without having to open a b ook. For this Resource Book, we want to offer GMs ideas to help them run better games, and mak e it e asier to handle t he improvisational parts. We cover subjects that generate a lot of que stions on forums, at conference panels, and even in our own games. Where it makes sense, we&amp;rsquo;ve also incorporated existing material into the guide that is useful to any GM, such as montages from the organized play program, along w ith a sim ple index of v aluable advice from the rest of the &amp;ldquo;core&amp;rdquo; sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
