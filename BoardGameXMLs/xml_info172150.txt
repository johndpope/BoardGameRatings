			<description>Publisher's Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the first to get your X-Team to the X-Mansion!  There's danger in the air!  Juggernaut, that unstoppable engine of destruction, is roaming about the X-Mansion.  Professor X's life is at risk.  He telepathically calls his X-Men to the rescue.  However, they are already on a mission to prevent Magneto from enrolling the Morlocks and their leader, Callisto, into his deadly plans.  Help the X-Men stop the villains and restore safety to the X-Mansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;X-Men was published as part of the Marvel Comics Super Heroes Game Book, and the board is a double-page spread of the book which is laid flat to play. It is in the Pachisi/Sorry family.  Each player has four markers. A roll of 4 is needed to get a marker on the start space. After that, they must enter a track and make their way around to their color of ladder  They must then make their way up the ladder and roll the exact number to land on the X-Mansion.  Along the way, if they land on another player's marker, they may either send it back to the start or take another turn. Spaces marked with villains move the marker backward or cause loss of a turn. The first player to land all four markers on the X-Mansion wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
