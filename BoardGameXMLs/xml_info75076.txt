			<description>User Summary: Card-based narrative game designed to be played in public places such as Starbucks with minimal equipment and no undue attention. Aimed at Court Intrigue, but generic-- does include two setting backdrops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the document:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Pique&amp;quot; RPG System Concept 2 (diceless, court intrigue)&lt;br/&gt;Pique is a role-playing game system that uses cards to represent aspects of each character. It was designed by Brent P. Newhall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Design Constraints&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The game must be comfortably playable at Starbucks. E.g., the group should only need a small table for playing space, and not attract undue attention with distracting props.&lt;br/&gt;     The only physical object required to play is a set of custom cards. I may include other objects, as long as they're easily portable and would fit on a small table, but I think I can stretch those cards to do everything needed.&lt;br/&gt;     The game will be playable with no GM, though GM-based play will also be supported.&lt;br/&gt;     Gameplay will focus on court intrigue, though combat will certainly be supported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
