							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Morg &#039;N&#039; Thorg</name>
									
			<description>From Forgeworld's webstore:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A hulking brute of an Ogre Blocker, Morg &amp;rsquo;N&amp;rsquo; Thorg is something of a lumbering juggernaut. Nearly eight feet tall, bludgeoning his way through the opposition, he&amp;rsquo;s always a spectacle to watch out for on the pitch. Off the field, his frightening appearance disguises a truly gentle nature, making him a bizarre hit with children &amp;ndash; on the pitch, however, he tramples anything that gets in his way, often simply handing the ball to one of his teammates and flinging them into the End Zone to score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Morg &amp;rsquo;N&amp;rsquo; Thorg, a truly legendary Blood Bowl player, can be added to any Blood Bowl team (except Undead; he&amp;rsquo;s really not a fan) with this multi-part resin kit. Particularly large and covered in spikes, with a knowing smirk on his gigantic face, he would be an asset to any Blood Bowl collection. His rules are found on a Star Player card in the Blood Bowl boxed set, and in Death Zone Season 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This kit comes in 7 components and includes 2 32mm round bases, one featuring a hole to slot a ball into, indicating possession of the ball in your games of Blood Bowl.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
