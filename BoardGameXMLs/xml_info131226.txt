							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tactical Conflict</name>
									
			<description>Tactical Conflict is an tactical wargame. It's played on a hex boardgame with different futuristic units and cards. With its simple rules, the game is easy to learn and fast to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two players face each other on a 8x18 hexes battlefield. Before the game begins each player chooses cards and buys an army of different units up to a fixed amount of money. The players start on the opposite side of the battlefield. Each player got three actions per turn, where he can command his units or play a card, which affects units or the battlefield itself. There are different hex types like swamp, street, bridge or forest. Some objects like buildings, cliffs and rocks may block the line of sight or can't be entered. Every unit has its special ability, like shooting through buildings for example, or climbing up rocks. Some other objects may give you protection and a hideout. The player who defeats all opposing units wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
