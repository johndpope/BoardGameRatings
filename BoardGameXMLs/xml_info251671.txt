			<description>React! is meant for 2 - 4 players. Players buy and trade chemicals, discover and perform reactions, and create special molecules, all while learning organic chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start with drawing cards, either chemicals or events. Then combine substrate and reagent cards to discover a reaction card. Mix reagent and reaction cards to discover your lab bench molecule. Events allow you to do something more, perhaps steal, sabotage, protect or more. Be the first to get all the reactions on your lab bench to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
