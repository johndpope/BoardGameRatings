			<description>A Decktet game for two players, in which you are a merchant attempting to claim as many trade routes throughout the kingdom as you can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ruta is a game of card drafting and network building, inspired by the popular game Ticket to Ride. A 5x3 grid of cards is used to represent the people and places with which players are trying to establish trade routes. Players take turns drawing cards and playing those cards to claim routes (orthogonal connections between adjacent cards on the map). Tokens are used to mark each player's routes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are awarded for each route that is claimed, and players earn bonus points for their longest continuous route. When one player is out of tokens, the game ends, and the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game requires a Decktet extended deck and 20 tokens in 2 colors (10 of each color). Suit chips may be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
