							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Historical Turning Points: New Dallas</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A lifeless planet with a bloody past, New Dallas was a mere footnote in history until the Devil's Brigade mercenaries rediscovered an ancient artifact in the early days of the Jihad. Their discovery revealed a secret history, long buried and believed lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home to the vast Hegemony Central Intelligence Directorate, New Dallas has been a lostech prospector's dream. The system was a shining jewel during the heyday of the Star League, lost after the fall of the Amaris Empire, and rediscovered during the opening shots of the Jihad. The secrets that lay among its ruins would change the course of technology in the Inner Sphere forever....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historical Turning Points: New Dallas details three era events that occurred on the planet. Containing three mini-campaigns using the Chaos Campaign rules, this campaign supplement gives players the option of fighting individual battles, following a campaign arc, inserting it into their own campaigns, and even creating their own scenarios with optional rules to give their games a &amp;quot;New Dallas flavor.&amp;quot; This PDF-exclusive book includes a detailed map of New Dallas, a comprehensive list of the forces involved on New Dallas across three eras, and several Tracks for players can use to run simple lance-on-lance battles or stage a complete world-wide invasion. The only limit is the players&amp;rsquo; imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
