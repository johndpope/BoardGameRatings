							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Labourer</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Labourer&lt;br/&gt;One of the Unlikely Heroes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Length: 4 pages + licence&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some work their whole lives just to get by.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They may not have the opportunities that others have. They may be born to poverty, or not have the mind or aptitude to make a better living. Some work with their hands out of choice, for the joy of doing an honest day's work. But most live hard lives, and survive troubled times with nothing more than fortitude and determination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While they are often considered the lowliest of the low, the common folk support entire economies by the work they do and the burdens they bear. With few abilities that can assist in times of trouble, they learn tenacity, endurance and resilience that few others can match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are The Labourers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasy literature abounds with tales of ordinary folk, lifted to the status of Hero by extraordinary events. The Unlikely Heroes are seven character classes with concepts drawn from the standard NPC classes in the DMG. They are for those exceptional people who choose not to adventure, but should fate intervene, their quality shines through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
