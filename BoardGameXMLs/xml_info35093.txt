			<description>Published in Game Journal #64, this is a card game with a very interesting theme. Players are World War II aircraft manufacturers trying to design the best fighter plane of WWII. Players can literally put together their dream plane, from jet-engined Zeros to Mustangs bristling with 50mm cannons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with 117 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a spin-off from Tank Extravaganza that was published in Game Journal #61, also from the same game designer. The designer also subsequently designed a similar game called Naval Competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
