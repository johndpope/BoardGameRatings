			<description>52 cards in 13 sets of four. They are all illustrated with characters from a specific country and they consist of, for example, Mr America, Miss America (both in colour) and a Mr America and a Miss America (not in colour). The object is to win tricks by the pairing of two cards relating to the same country. The pairs maybe a wedding pair, a pair of spinsters or a pair of bachelors. Each pair has a value in points. A 'Society' Wedding (the two coloured cards of a country scores 5 points. A 'Quiet' Wedding (The two non-coloured cards of a country or one with colour and one without) scores 3 points. A Pair of Spinsters or Pair of Bachelors (from the same country) scores 1 point. If you can collect all four cards from a country, you can score bonus points; Two Society Wedding Pairs 15 points; Two Wedding Pairs - no Society Wedding 10 points; Pair of Spinsters and a Pair of Bachelors 6 points.&lt;br/&gt;The game play is interesting. Players draw a card and place it to start to form rows of cards face-up. Five such cards are permitted in a row. If two cards from the same country 'touch' each other (vertically, horizentally or diagonal) then that pair is taken by the player. If a pair is taken the remaining cards are moved to the left of their row. If a card reaches the left end of a row and needs to be moved it is added to the right end of the row above.&lt;br/&gt;Play several hands and the first player to reach 100 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;A solitaire variant is also reccomended in the rules.&lt;br/&gt;Undated but it was probably in Austerity Britain in the 1950's (The rules say that there are only limited numbers of the game available, due to quota restrictions).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
