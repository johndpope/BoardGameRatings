			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An action game in which you dogfight unending streams of enemy jets for a set time limit of less than five minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on jet fighter combat during the Cold War era (1954 to 1979 in the game). At first you'll only have jets armed with guns (early 50s). Soon you will also have access to jets armed with early (and unreliable) heat seeking air-to-air missiles which must be fired at the rear of an enemy jet (mid 50s). Radar guided missiles are added to your arsenal next, then defensive countermeasures. Some jets are only armed with a small number of missiles and no gun, which reflects the time period during which some &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot; theorized that guided missiles and high speeds would negate the need for guns and dogfighting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played as a Cold War campaign. Every time you kill 5 planes, time advances 1 year and you get to unlock one or more new planes which may offer more advanced technology, longer play times or different weapons loadouts. You can purchase more modern aircraft before playing through to the year that they are unlocked in the campaign. However, all planes can be unlocked for free through continued successful play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
