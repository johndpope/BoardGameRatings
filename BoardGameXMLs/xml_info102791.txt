			<description>When the night settles on the city of New Sodomy nightly creatures begin their work. The customers are waiting and need sadisfaction...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Hooker players try to work their way up on the human market - selling themselves. Players have 6 skills (oral, anal, vaginal, fetish, social, lesbian)and stamina which is used up as the night passes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is two ways to win: when a hooker has collected $ 50 she's able to buy herself out of the system and get a normal life; if a hooker should get 3 points in every skill she'll be offered a work in high-class establisment and she can get off the streets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
