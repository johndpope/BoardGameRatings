							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lost Legends of Urethiel (2.0)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Enchanted Continent offers much to practitioners of magic and masters of the martial arts, but Urethiel&amp;rsquo;s greatest resources are the legends and myths rife in its teahouses and taverns. Never before have so many of these tales been gathered in one place, each brought to life with beautiful illustrations so that their stories ring true in the minds of players for time immemorial!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside of this supplement for the Veranthea Codex you&amp;rsquo;ll find 10 new creatures, a dozen new NPCs, a handful of feats and magic items for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, and a city of undead masters:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Amigara and the Canyon of the Spiral&amp;mdash;a stone-cold CR 8 killer that takes the place of its victims&lt;br/&gt;    Benzaiten and Hotei, CR 15 Fukujin that bring luck and good fortune on those they come across&lt;br/&gt;    Fire Naga, a CR 12 spirit of good will and protection (though its overwhelm person spell is decidedly less benign)&lt;br/&gt;    The CR 3 orang-bati and CR 6 orang-minyak&amp;mdash;both are vile, but the former whisks you away on leathery wings while the latter mires you in the vile, thick oil that sloughs off of it in troves&lt;br/&gt;    Seon-samang, a chilling new CR 5 undead accompanied by Cho-Nyo, a mysterious (CR 8) mesmerist&lt;br/&gt;    Sigbin, a small CR 4 magical beast that is as similar to a goat in looks as it is in disposition (if a bit more violent) but don&amp;rsquo;t fret&amp;mdash;magic items for controlling the cantankerous animals are included&lt;br/&gt;    The CR 4 tek-tek, a terrifying undead that slices open its victims with the bony axe jutting from its torso (and should you want the weapon for yourself or to acquire one of these monstrosities, there are magic items and feats in here for you!)&lt;br/&gt;    A tsuchigomo arachnid (CR 10) and the tsuchigo template (CR +3) for making terrifying half-spider monsters&lt;br/&gt;    10 true legends of Urethiel, NPCs perfect for a game of Veranthea Codex or to be used in an eastern fantasy setting:&lt;br/&gt;    Xingzhi of the Grove (Female humand druid 2) and her elk companion Tu&amp;oacute;l&amp;ugrave;&lt;br/&gt;    Airen the Hammer (Male dwarf samurai 5) and his trusty steed Jiashi!&lt;br/&gt;    Dai-Neng (Female elf pyrokineticist 8), seeker of enlightenment&lt;br/&gt;    The dubious Bao-Lo/Sixing (Male half-orc vigilante 11), fighter of injustice in Kaihuan&lt;br/&gt;    Tetzu the Windslasher (Male half-elf hunter 13) and Dai-Shan the tiger, murderous haters of sylph&lt;br/&gt;    Stone Farmer (Male human fighter 14) and Xianghua (Female human alchemist 5/monk 2/ninja 3), two unlikely warriors that may well be the ones to finally upset the balance of power in Verentai&lt;br/&gt;    Zhai-Zhi the Dragonslayer (Male human slayer 14), perhaps the Enchanted Continent&amp;rsquo;s greatest thief&lt;br/&gt;    Sh&amp;eacute;ny&amp;ugrave; Xiaoy&amp;ugrave;h&amp;eacute; (Female halfling oracle 17), a legendary healer that walks the lands of the Dynasties easing pain&lt;br/&gt;    Jenri-Kamahi the Mad Witch Hunter (Female human barbarian 10/conduit 8)&lt;br/&gt;    The Black Journal of Siw&amp;aacute;ng, a curious tome that has been the death of many&lt;br/&gt;    A detailed entry on Tian-Ti Ang, the City of Vampires (including information on the five great houses, rules for conduct, and an 11th level noble keen to cause chaos in the secret settlement)&lt;br/&gt;    New artwork that improves the cover, back cover, and interior of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
