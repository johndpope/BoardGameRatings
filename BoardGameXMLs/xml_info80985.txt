			<description>The game had featured several enhancements over Streets of Rage and Streets of Rage 2  such as a more complex plot, multiple endings, longer levels, more in-depth scenarios (with interactive levels and the return of traps like pits) and faster gameplay (with dash and dodge moves). Weapons could now only be used for a few times before breaking and could now be integrated with unique moves with certain characters, hidden characters were added and a few cutscenes were included to give the story greater depth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is more fast-paced than its prequels. Running and vertical-dodge moves were added, and most player attacks deal less damage than in the predecessors. The level timer has been replaced with a &amp;quot;power meter&amp;quot; that, when full, allows players to perform special moves without draining the player's life bar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the first and second game, weapons in Street of Rage 3 can only be used a fixed number of times. However, additional weapon special attacks could be performed. The game also features team in which two characters work together to perform a powerful attack. Blitz moves, performed while players run, were altered so that they can be upgraded in strength over the course of the game. The player would have to earn a set amount of points on one life to upgrade it. Losing a chance would put the blitz move down a level, but the upgraded moves are still possible to do by pressing X on a 6 button controller, followed by a button sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traps in stages were brought back from the original game, for example, enemies can once again be thrown into pits or off the side of an elevator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemy AI was expanded so more enemies can pick up weapons, block attacks, employ co-operative attacks (usually, a Big Ben-like enemy will throw one of the Garcia enemies at the character to smack them down), and even steal exposed food items to regain health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Streets of Rage III&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
