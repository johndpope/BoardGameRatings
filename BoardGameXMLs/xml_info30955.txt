			<description>This is a trivia/brainteaser type game marketed for children. Includes 200 Noodle Booster challenge cards, 80 tokens, 6 &amp;quot;Take a Chance&amp;quot; cards, and a one minute timer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher: &amp;quot;The game designed by Gifted Program educators.Testing to identify gifted students is based on higher-level cognitive processes and to a large extent children are poorly prepared due to little or no exposure to such subject matter. Noodle Booster exposes players to these concepts and techniques in a fun format. Studies and research demonstrate that a child's performance will increase significantly by merely becoming familiar with the concepts.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
