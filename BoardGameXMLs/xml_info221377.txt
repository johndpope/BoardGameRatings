			<description>The TCG set is based on the changes between Pok&amp;eacute;mon Diamond and Pearl and Platinum, including Giratina in both its Altered Forme and its Origin Forme, as well as introducing Shaymin to the Trading Card Game. It also features Team Galactic's Pok&amp;eacute;mon and various Trainer cards based on them. Platinum also introduces two new mechanics to the Trading Card Game. The first new mechanic is a new type of Pok&amp;eacute;mon known as Pok&amp;eacute;mon SP. The second new mechanic to be introduced is the Lost Zone. The Lost Zone is essentially a second discard pile: however, it is not located in the play area. Hence, cards that are moved to the Lost Zone cannot be retrieved by cards which specify the recovery of cards from the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Platinum features 130 new cards. Theme Decks feature a full 60 Pokemon card deck with special holographic foil card , metallic coin, and damage counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Platinum roughly corresponds to the contemporaneous Japanese-language expansion Galactic's Conquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
