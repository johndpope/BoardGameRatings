			<description>Indygo is a narrative game with elements of point'n'click set in one room only - painting workshop. It tells the story of a painter who suffers from depression. One of the symptoms is&lt;br/&gt;proceeding isolation. Main character haven&amp;rsquo;t left his room for more than 3 months. The person who helps him live through this hard time is his girlfriend Anna. It became obvious for&lt;br/&gt;both of them, that this situation can&amp;rsquo;t last forever. The time has come to look for solution. It&amp;rsquo;s up to player to decide how the story will progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Main topic of game is depression and isolation. We make an attempt to illustrate what people affected by disturbances of mood can experience. We want to counteract the stigmatisation of those people. During the game you will see the world through the eyes of the main character. Many puzzles await to be solved and letters to be read. Painter&amp;rsquo;s journal gives us a detailed information about his mental state and thoughts. Inquisitives will be able to find additional hints bonding story together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Handmade graphic and music are important elements that add depth to story. The room changes accordingly to the mental state of a character. Game has multiple endings. How the story ends depends on the seemingly trivial decisions during the game. Our goal was to make the players choose, how the story will progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
