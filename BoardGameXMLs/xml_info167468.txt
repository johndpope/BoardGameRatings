			<description>In Kuh Vadis, two players compete to connect their three locations in the field before the other player does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start the game be marking three pre-set locations on a 7x7 field with either Xs or Os. The remaining spaces show either cows or numbers 1-5. On a turn, the player rolls five dice up to three times, keeping any number of dice she wishes after each roll. If after the third roll she has either two cows or three of the same number showing on the dice, she can mark one of these spaces on the grid with an X or O as appropriate. (If she has both two cows and three of a kind, she marks only one space.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If she has a four-of-a-kind of either cows or one number, she marks one space, then takes another turn &amp;mdash; but on this turn she must mark a space adjacent (either orthogonal or diagonal) to the previously marked space. If she continues to get quartets, she can keep marking spaces and taking additional turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends as soon as one player has created a chain of marks that connects her three starting locations, and this player wins. If a player blocks off one of the opponent's starting locations, then this opponent had best do the same in order to ensure a draw; otherwise she's sure to lose!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
