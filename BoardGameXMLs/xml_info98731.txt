			<description>A roll and move game where the object is to have the most money after all trucks have circled the highway (ie: game board) three times. Players roll a die and move that many spaces on the game board and follow the instructions of the space they landed on. There are two types of cards which a space may say to draw one of them, Smokey Bear and Chicken Coop (weigh station). Again, the player follows the directions on the card. Players will gain and lose money both from the spaces on the game board and the cards mentioned previously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
