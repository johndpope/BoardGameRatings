			<description>Publishers description from the game box backside translated in English: &lt;br/&gt;A safe way to school. Children are the weakest participants in traffic and are - justified - protected. But it is important, that the children themselves know traffic rules, so they can use their knowledge in real life. The basics for this are the traffic signs, one must know the signs and what they mean. In this game children learn the most important traffic signs just by playing. Each player that knows what a traffic sign mean can move his pawn on a symbolic pedestrians crossing one &amp;quot;move&amp;quot; ahead. Who knows the most traffic signs and is first to reach the goal?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Verkehrszeichen kennen is a quiz game. One player draws a card from the tile, shows the sign and asks the question. Usually along the lines of &amp;quot;what does this traffic sign mean&amp;quot;. He hides the answer on the bottom of the card. For a correct answer the player who answered can go one step ahead of the playing board, which is made to look like a pedestrian crossing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
