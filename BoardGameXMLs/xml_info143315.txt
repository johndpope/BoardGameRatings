			<description>Publisher Advertisement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manage a motion picture crew on location as you hunt for exotic animals in the game of SAFARI. Can you get your crew through the hazards? Are you good enough and fast enough to capture some good pictures? Will you get there before the other crews? Find out with Safari.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Documentation accompanying program listing in SoftSide Magazine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player (or Bwana) is in charge of a safari camp and must organize filming parties including camera crews and bearers, to search the vast 169-region safari country for wild animals. Scoring is accomplished when you successfully film in a region containing an animal. The player with the most film contract points at the end of the game gets the big movie contract and along with that, the usual fame and fortune. When only one person plays the object of the game is to score as many points as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
