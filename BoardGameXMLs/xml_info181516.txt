							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wings of Glory: World War 1 â€“ Bristol F.2B Fighter</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bristol F.2B Fighter was a British two-seat biplane fighter and reconnaissance aircraft of the First World War flown by the Royal Flying Corps. Despite being a two-seater, the F.2B proved to be an agile aircraft that was able to hold its own against opposing single-seat fighters. It was flown by a number of famous aces such as the Australian Eustace Headlam and the British W.F.J. Harvey. Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW1 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
