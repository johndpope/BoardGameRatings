							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Volkhen Alien Race</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Only Logical Race for Your Next Character&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The alien race known as the Volkhen are often mistaken for humans or elves, but in fact hail from the planet Volkhen. Strong, durable, and gifted with minor telepathic abilities, the Volkhen were once an aggressive and warlike people ruled by their emotions. Long ago, however, a social revolution overtook the Volkhen people, who learned to suppress and control their emotions, rather than being controlled by them. The Volkhen of today are a civilized and orderly race who value logic and discipline, and have mastered advanced psychic techniques. This book includes the Volkhen race, as well as a selection of Volkhen-themed feats, including the powerful techniques of the Volkhen sleep strike and the Volkhen mental bonding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
