			<description>Mega Lo Mania is a real-time strategy computer game developed by Sensible Software. Mega Lo Mania was released in North America as Tyrants: Fight Through Time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to conquer 28 islands divided into sectors, with three islands per Epoch and one for the final Epoch. The player must take on the role of one of four Gods: Scarlet (Red), Oberon (Yellow), Caesar (Green) or Madcap (Blue). As their God, the player must lead his or her people by instructing them to do a number of different tasks such as create buildings, design weapons, mine for elements or form an army. The ultimate aim is to defeat all the other Gods by destroying their towers and their people.&lt;br/&gt;Screenshot of Mega Lo Mania (Amiga)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are multiple sectors on each island, and multiple islands spanning different Epochs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each sector can be either empty, or be occupied by a particular people. Although the player cannot see before they occupy a sector, each has different types of minerals and elements available to it that can put the occupier at an advantage or disadvantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every island has a differing shape with different numbers of sectors dividing it. Islands in this game can have anywhere between two and sixteen sectors on a four by four grid. Some islands are small enough to only allow two different Gods to play against each other, whilst others are strategically designed for various gameplay scenarios, such as islands that are not connected, requiring flight in the form of jetplanes or biplanes for armies to attack each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Epochs determine the base technology level that each group of people begin with. For example, in the 1st Epoch, the starting technology level is equal to that of 9500 BC, meaning that each starting tower resembles a caveman's dwelling. In each Epoch (except the final Epoch) there are three islands and each must be conquered before proceeding to the next. The player may use research to develop along the technology tree, eventually increasing in epoch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Mega Lo Mania , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
