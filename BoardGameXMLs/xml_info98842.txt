			<description>Bogey Dead 6 (released in Japan as Sidewinder and in Europe as Raging Skies) is a 1996 flight sim video game by Asmik. The game features six real fighter planes which include the F-4E, F-14D, F-15E, F-16C, F/A-18E and the F/A-22 Raptor. The game is played as an ace pilot for the United States Air Force. The objective is to protect the United States from communist invasion, enemy involvement and terrorist crime. The game is very similar to the Ace Combat series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes the role of an air pilot who is part of an elite first strike air unit. This unit is tasked with putting a stop to an international crime organization that is building up a military sized force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this air combat game, players can choose to play in a training mode, play a mission mode, or have a VS. battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training mode features 3 different missions with players attempting to get as high of a score as possible. VS. battle has 2 players linking up to play a head-to-head battle against each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main mode is the mission mode. Players can choose from 6 different fighter jets which are the F-4E Phantom II, F-14D Tomcat, F/A-18 Hornet, F-15E Eagle, F-16C Falcon and the F-22 Raptor, each with their own ratings in max speed, endurance, maneuverability, and stability. The game features 12 missions to play through, with objectives such as defending a weapons factory or shooting down a stolen F-16. Each mission completed successfully will reward the player a certain number of credits depending on the difficulty of that mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay involves flying a fighter with a cockpit view. The HUD includes a radar showing the enemy fighters locations plus the number of enemies left. There is also a rear view mirror which lets the player see if there are any enemy fighters on their tail. Players can fire their air-to-air, air-to-surface, and air-to-ground missiles at enemy units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Options let the player adjust the difficulty level and change the controls between easy or hard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bogey Dead 6&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
