			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brigade E5: New Jagged Union is a tactical turn-based game that successfully blends together advantages of both real-time and turn-based games. The scene of action is a small tropical country called Palinero, which is on the verge of civil war. You, as the main character in the game, has to hire a band of mercenaries, decide which side you will support in combat, and take control of the situation. &lt;br/&gt;New Jagged Union features a combat system called &amp;quot;SPM&amp;quot;, (Smart Pause Mode), which is merged between the real-time and turn-based combat system. Each action here does not cost &amp;quot;action points&amp;quot; but just takes some time to execute.&lt;br/&gt;Brigade E5: New Jagged Union is the ideological successor to the Jagged Alliance series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key features: Fair AI capable of surprising real adepts of tactical warfare.&lt;br/&gt;More than 100 NPC&amp;rsquo;s and 50 mercenaries ready to join your team.&lt;br/&gt;More than 40 different locations: Towns, villages, plant facilities, military bases etc. &lt;br/&gt;Freedom of moving on the global map, and a non-linear storyline.&lt;br/&gt;The game also features over 100 accurately modeled firearms with a number of ammunition types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
