			<description>Dark Savior (ダークセイバー) is an isometric 3D mixed genre game for the Sega Saturn created by Climax Entertainment. It was referred to by Gamespot as a sequel to the developer's game for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, Landstalker: The Treasures of King Nole, even though the games' storylines are unrelated, their gameplay is considerably different, and an official sequel to Landstalker (Lady Stalker: Challenge from the Past) had already been released. Climax never marketed Dark Savior as a sequel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dark Savior&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
