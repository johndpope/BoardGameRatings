			<description>Players start from Europe and sail to distant countries to collect treasures and transport them back to Europe, in order to sell them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Board with an illustrated map of the world (exluding America) that is overlayed by a grid (for moving). The word CAPRICORN is written on the board and it has also spaces for stack of cards (black, red and yellow).&lt;br/&gt;    Three decks of cards: &lt;br/&gt;        Black Action cards (e.g. &amp;quot;riot on a ship&amp;quot;), &lt;br/&gt;        Red Item cards (e.g. &amp;quot;pumps, rations, compass...&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;        Yellow Treasure cards (e.g. &amp;quot;gems, spices...&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    Game money (banknotes), which is named Rix (in Alga's Swedish edition, however, the currency lacks a name). &lt;br/&gt;    A ship and a sailor carrying a gun and barrel (of rhum?) as playing tokens. The sailor represents an entire crew.&lt;br/&gt;    Die (Alga's Swedish edition contains two dice.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was owned by Kuvataide Bildkonst and published in Finland; and then licensed to Alga for publication in Sweden; both events took place in the 1960's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
