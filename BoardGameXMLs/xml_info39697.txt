			<description>LoYo! is an ingenious combination of Strategy, Risk, Memorization and Luck! But most of all, it is fun, easy to learn and quick play for family and friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to have the lowest score at the end of six rounds of play. Each player receives four face-down cards. After glancing at any two cards. Players pull cards numbered 1 to 9 and two specialty cards LoYo (zero) and OH NO! (fifteen) from the deck or dead pile and replace with their cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to get LoYo! cards and avoid the dreaded OH NO! cards. When you think you have the lowest score, shout &amp;quot;LoYo&amp;quot; to roll the dice and get a bonus deduction or add to your opponent ... But watch out! Someone may catch you and double your score! Feel like giving up? Don't worry, there's LoYo! Catch-Up, that rewards a triple bonus value of the dice in order to &amp;quot;Catch-Up&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two other versions that can be incorporated to add greater complexity to original game. So, if you feel like taking more risk? Add LoYo! Challenge. This feature challenges all players to a potential &amp;quot;all in poker show down&amp;quot; at the beginning of each round.  Also, if you want a mind boggling experience try LoYo! Headache, which utilizes six cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be one of the first persons to play this quick playing game craze that combines the best of poker, Concentration, Uno and then some.  LoYo! is sure to be a favorite of yours for years to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take a peek at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.loyogame.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.loyogame.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com?tag=article-boardgamegeek-20&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.amazon.com?tag=article-boardgamegeek-20&lt;/a&gt; search word ...loyo game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
