			<description>Volume one of the Doomstones Campaign.&lt;br/&gt;Collects the two books Fire in the Mountains and Blood in Darkness previously published by Flame Publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Yetzin Valley stand at the southern end of a vital mountain pass between the Empire and the Border Princes. Settled by Dwarfs, conquered by Orcs, it has lain quiet for almost a century. Now, once again, powerful forces are on the move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A chance discovery on the mountains puts the adventurers on the trail of a legendary Orcish war-force, the Bloodaxe Alliance. They must retrace the last journey of the renegade warrior-priest Torgoch, to find his resting place and the powerful artefact which let him control life and cheat death. Then, following another ancient trail through the Vaults, they will discover the relics of a mutiny, a clue which leads to an ancient Dwarven shrine, and a second Crystal of Power. But finding the shrine is just the beginning, for beyond it lie age-old Dwarven traps, and the tunnels' modern dwellers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for characters in their second or third carreers, Fire and Blood mixes investigation and combat to challenge the wits and skill of WFRP players. This book includes pre-generated player characters, new magic items and twenty pages of handouts, including two three-dimensional models.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
