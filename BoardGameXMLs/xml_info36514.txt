							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alexander the Great&#039;s Campaigns</name>
									
			<description>A book on the campaigns of Alexander with detailed information on pay scales, organization, logistics and march rates to help the miniature gamer recreate an accurate tabletop campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot; This book includes what is probably the most detailed and accurate account of Alexander as a military commander so far published as well as all the information on march rates, logistics, pay, loot, sieges, armament, organisation and other related factors required by wargamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It describes the troops of Alexander's own armies and their opponents, their tactics and weapons and how these altered to meet changing circumstances. As well as being a tremedously exciting and stimulating read, the book is thus an essential reference source, at once of immense value to Ancient wargamers and food for thought to serious historians.&amp;quot; (from the dustjacket)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
