			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's been three years since the second version of Where No Man Has Gone Before has been released. Since that time, I've continued writing&amp;mdash;my hard drive is strewn with oddments and ideas, some of them fun and/or interesting, many that can only be put under the label &amp;ldquo;Kill With Fire.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document collects many of those odds and ends: several tidbits from the Animated Series, some optional rules, more ships, more Talents, bits and pieces from the previous versions of the game that didn't make it into the new version. And more random tables, of course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In other words, this is something of a grab bag supplement, the RPG equivalent of a casserole. Think of it as an extension of the Appendix from the core rules: you can use or ignore anything from the following pages as you please. In fact, I encourage cherry-picking. So, pull up a chair, put some relaxing music on and dig in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
