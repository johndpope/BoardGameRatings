			<description>In the game of Dicke D&amp;auml;monen, the players are magicians trying to rule the world. Curiously the world is smaller than you might think because in the eyes of a magician the world consists only of magical power lines and power fields, specifically four power lines: earth, fire, air and water. Wherever these lines enfold the space, the power fields are created; wherever the lines cross each other, the corners of these fields materialize. (In game terms, four colored strings &amp;mdash; each tied to a ring &amp;mdash; are placed on the table overlapping one another at the start of the game.) The magicians summon ghosts and demons to rule the world &amp;mdash; but at the start of it all nobody knows which type of creature will be the strongest:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Ghosts &amp;ndash; white creatures &amp;ndash; appear in the center of a power field, and wherever they are summoned, everything freezes in terror. Neither ghosts nor demons may appear in a power field once a ghost has been summoned there.&lt;br/&gt;     Demons &amp;ndash; in the colors of the power lines &amp;ndash; appear in the corners of the power fields adjacent to the lines of their color. No demon will enter a field where a ghost was summoned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each magician summons again and again one of the four creatures at a place of his choice, thus filling the world with ghosts and demons. (Ghosts and demons are wooden pawns drawn from a cloth bag.) As soon as no more creature can be summoned, the fate of the world is decided &amp;ndash; and one of the colors will be the strongest. Only once during the game can each magician predict a color, whether one of the demon colors or ghostly white, and each magician must predict a different color. (A player predicts a color by placing a pawn of the color in front of him.) This look into the future costs a lot of energy, and as soon as someone predicts a color, he will be harassed by fate and the other magicians. Thus, which color to predict is an important decision as well as when to predict it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The magician who predicted the color which is the the strongest in the end rules the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
