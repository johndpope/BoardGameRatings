Every time the player performs an action such as attacking or walking, the opponents also take action. Escape from the dungeon is usually only allowed in certain places, or through the use of certain items. Additionally, when the player loses the game the player loses all money plus half the player's items in the more forgiving variants, or loses everything and has to start from scratch in others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mystery Dungeon&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
