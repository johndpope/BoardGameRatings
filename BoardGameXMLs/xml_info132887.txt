							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Song of Sixpence</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this short adventure the players take on the roles of a band of bards known as &amp;quot;The Beholders&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the last 99 years, the town of Frog's Hollow has held its annual All Hallows' Eve Ball, an extravagant and exclusive affair. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the acclaimed event. Everyone who's anyone will be in attendance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year the town's planning committee gathers together to decide on the entertainment for that year. For the last 3 years, Lord Callus of Montello has tried to persuade them to allow his son, Beeb Montello, to receive that coveted honor. Alas, the committee has high standards, and could not be persuaded to grant the arrogant man-child the nomination. After all, it seemed to them that the boy was more concerned with primp than song!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year, the year of the 100th All Hallows' Eve Ball, Lord Callus will not be ignored. Taking matters into his own hands, he has hired an Oracle by the name of Alagar Greyskut to make sure his son sings at the Ball. Greyskut has received a lofty sum to see this task through, and he means to succeed. His first plan of action is to make sure that the musicians who are supposed to play the Ball don't show up. &amp;quot;The Beholders&amp;quot; haven't a clue just how hard this gig is going to be!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
