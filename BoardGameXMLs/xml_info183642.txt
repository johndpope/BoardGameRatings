			<description>There&amp;rsquo;s a Snitch in the Mafia, and the Godfather has ordered us to take him out! Snitch is a hidden identity card game set in the world of the mafia, played with 4-6 friends in about 15 to 30 minutes. Play as the Mobster and attempt to whack the Snitch. Or play as the Snitch, and frame the mobsters so they turn on each other! Watch out for the Police, as they can be tipped off towards anyone. If we don't whack the Snitch in time, he's sure to get into protective custody!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A round consists of a hit being placed on one of the players. Whether or not they&amp;rsquo;re a Snitch is for you to decide. Use cards in your hand to attack, or protect the target. Cash can be used to influence the hit in either direction! If enough damage is dealt to a player, they can be sent to the hospital, or whacked!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take part in Mob Jobs. If the job is snitched on, the game gets more difficult for the Mobsters, and the Snitch gets closer to protective custody. The deck also consists of mafia associates, who's skills can be used to further your agenda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mobsters win if they whack the Snitch! The Snitch wins if enough Mobsters are whacked, or if enough police are in play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
