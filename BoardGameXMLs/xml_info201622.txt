							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Girls Gone Rogue</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning: Girls Gone Rogue contains words and pictures of a sexual nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want to take your space opera, exploration of the stars, or retro sci-fi emulation to a rating of R, NC-17, or even XXX, then consider Girls Gone Rogue your gateway drug of choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the one and only supplement for Alpha Blue... your sleazy, vintage parody of so many sci-fi movies and TV shows!  Girls Gone Rogue has tables for making your alien even more unique, female idiosyncracies (more than likely, you'll be picking up a girl or two at your local space pub), starship combat, what the PCs were up to in-between adventures, and countless others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It also provides further information on playing mystical knights known as the zedi and star priests known as templars... with a few tips for playing robots, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book also has a detailed multi-session adventure, as well as, several scenario seeds/sketches for your campaign.  You don't need Alpha Blue to get a lot of use out of Girls Gone Rogue... but it helps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with the book, there are several high quality maps of starships and a somewhat generic but totally awesome &amp;quot;bar&amp;quot; that's featured in a variety of adventures.  If you want these maps in a larger file size (for blowing up and laminating), just let me know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One last thing, some of the content of Girls Gone Rogue should be considered &amp;quot;adults only&amp;quot;.  Visually, if goes beyond Alpha Blue.  You've been warned...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
