			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the dead return, hungry for brains, smart folk know that the only way to stay alive is to stick together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Cortex Plus ACTION ROLEPLAYING hack focuses on the Player Characters as a team of survivors, thrown together by circumstance and working together to make it in a world overrun by zombies of many different varieties. There are only three things they have to do: (1) scrounge for resources, (2) avoid antagonistic survivors that want to steal their stuff, and (3) when they inevitably run into a horde of zombies&amp;hellip;go for a HEAD SHOT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HEAD SHOT! is not a standalone game! It uses the ACTION ROLEPLAYING flavor of Cortex Plus, found on pages 116-154 of the Cortex Plus Hacker&amp;rsquo;s Guide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this hack, you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    An introduction to the Zombie Apocalypse of your own creation!&lt;br/&gt;    Full details on creating Player Characters (AKA &amp;quot;Survivors&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;    New and variant Attributes, Distinctions, Specialties, Signature Assets, and 37 new or modified Talents.&lt;br/&gt;    New framing devices and mechanics for Missions that force the Survivors to brave the zombie hordes to scrounge up supplies, help other folks out, and otherwise put themselves in danger.&lt;br/&gt;    The Viral Pool, a pool of difficulty dice that also feature mechanisms for generating random encounters and hazards!&lt;br/&gt;    A huge variety of zombies, including 4 main types and 5 variants that you can mix and match, plus all the rules for creating zombies of varying mechanical complexity.&lt;br/&gt;    Voodoo zombies, a completely different take on zombies both mechanically and story-wise.&lt;br/&gt;    An entire chapter of antagonists (gangs, cults, psychopaths, bandits), environmental hazards, and wild animals that may threaten Survivors who are lucky enough to sneak past the zombie hordes.&lt;br/&gt;    Tips for stealing these rules and ideas for other flavors of Cortex Plus, such as Dramatic and Heroic.&lt;br/&gt;    A character sheet designed specifically for use with this hack!&lt;br/&gt;    Game Master cheat sheets for quick rules referencing, or for use as inserts in your favorite DIY Game Master Screen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you ready to brave a world overrun by the walking dead?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
