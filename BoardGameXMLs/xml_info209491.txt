			<description>When some of the most dangerous monsters are captured, they are sent to dungeons all over the world, but some of those dungeons's keepers might be even more dangerous than the monsters themselves as they are part of an evil organization of Dungeon Overlords, and like every dark entity, all they want is to be in possession of the meanest and angriest monsters they can get. That's why when they receive weak monsters, they always try to send them to other dungeons. Who will be the last true Overlord?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monsters in Motion is a fast paced party game for 3 to 8 players. Each player will have a limited set of choices during the game; the amount of strategy, deception and push your luck will start building up as the game goes on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will receive 4 monster cards and 3 power souls which represent the live points.&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, each player has to choose a monster card and put it face-down in front of him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting from the Overlord with the Soulstone (first player token) and following in the direction previously selected, each player will have to choose one of two actions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.KEEP: The player will keep the face-down monster.&lt;br/&gt;2.SWAP: The player will swap the monster with the next player in turn order, the said player having to accept the swap unless his monster ability indicates differently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After that, everyone is required to reveal their cards and other monster abilities will trigger.  Finally, the weakest monster will make his overlord lose one power soul.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player loses all his power souls he will become a ghost. Living players (that still have power souls in front of them) cannot talk with ghosts, if they do, the ghost will be able to steal a power soul from them. The only living player that can talk with ghosts is the person in charge of the Soulstone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a ghost is in charge of the Soulstone he will be able to play that round, and during that round he will get one card from the monster deck. Ghosts are still ghosts, even if they are playing a round, so living players cannot talk with them. &lt;br/&gt;If a ghost succeeds in stealing a power soul from other player or revives thanks to a monster ability, he will be completely back in the game and so he will draw the same number of cards as the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each monster will have powers that will trigger at different moments during the game. As the game goes on, each power will be crucial to win the game. The winner will be the last Overlord alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
