			<description>Narcissu (Japanese: ナルキッソス Hepburn: Narukissosu) is a free visual novel video game developed by the dōjin group Stage-nana, telling the story of a terminally ill young man and woman. It was made with the NScripter engine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work was originally written in Japanese by Tomo Kataoka, and subsequently localized and translated into English, Chinese, French, Korean, Russian and Vietnamese by various fan translators. Unlike most fan translations, however, this was an authorised work. The author, however, was not actively involved in the translation process as it had been the case for True Remembrance. Both the original Japanese visual novel and its English version were released as free downloads over the Internet. The web edition of Narcissu has lower graphics and music quality, to conserve bandwidth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Narcissu is an experimental work: it uses minimalist graphics in a very narrow window, and includes two full scripts, one accompanied by a voice track, and the other adapted to work without voices. In the English translation, different translators translated each version, to provide different perspectives on the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Narcissu&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story    &amp;quot;There exists no such thing as a perfect sentence. Just as there exists no such thing as perfect despair.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;    - Haruki Murakami, &amp;quot;Hear The Wind Sing&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;... on that blindingly bright day ...&lt;br/&gt;... on that very day of winter ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine what it would be like to have your entire life -- your friends, your family, your interests, your loves, your hatreds, your future -- all taken away from you in a single instant. Imagine a hard, lumpy bed, a noise-filled ward, the sharp sting of needles entering your flesh at all hours of the day, the indignity of being woken up just as you are about to fall asleep for incessant vital statistics measurements, the doctors whose names you don't know (but that's okay, because they don't remember your name, either; they just remember you as &amp;quot;the non-small cell lung carcinoma in room 6&amp;quot;), and your own name, your very own name, that you have just about forgotten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then you might have some clue as to what it is like to be dying in a hospital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a story of disease and suffering; of medication and adverse effects; of thoracotomy scars and cellular poisons; of the living who cannot help but to die and of the dying who cannot help but to live; of a resting place other than &amp;quot;on 7F&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;at home&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a story of so many things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But most of all ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the story&lt;br/&gt;of a girl whose heart was standing still&lt;br/&gt;and a boy whose breath was being stolen away,&lt;br/&gt;both of whom die. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
