			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once when the entire world was overburdened by the&lt;br/&gt;increasing military power of demons in the form of&lt;br/&gt;kings, mother earth assumed the shape of a cow and&lt;br/&gt;approached Lord Brahma for relief. Sympathetic to&lt;br/&gt;mother earth's lamentation, Brahma, accompanied by&lt;br/&gt;Lord Siva and other demigods, took the cow-shaped&lt;br/&gt;mother earth to the shore of the milk ocean, where he&lt;br/&gt;offered prayers to please Lord Visnu, who lay there&lt;br/&gt;on an island in transcendental ecstasy. Brahma thereafter&lt;br/&gt;understood the advice of Maha-Visnu, who informed&lt;br/&gt;him that He would appear on the surface of&lt;br/&gt;the earth to mitigate the burden created by the demons.&lt;br/&gt;The demigods, along with their wives, should&lt;br/&gt;appear there as associates of Lord Krsna in the family&lt;br/&gt;of Yadu to increase the sons and grandsons in that&lt;br/&gt;dynasty. Brahma informed mother earth about all this,&lt;br/&gt;and then he returned to his own abode&amp;hellip;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to a world where gods and heroes walk the&lt;br/&gt;earth. A time unprecedented in the earths history. It is&lt;br/&gt;a time when the entire celestial host, from the heavenly&lt;br/&gt;planets to the hellish realms, converged on earth&lt;br/&gt;to battle for universal supremacy. The demonic forces&lt;br/&gt;plotted for total control: incarnating in human forms&lt;br/&gt;in the dynasties of kings so that they may rule the&lt;br/&gt;world. Those who did not take a mortal form possessed&lt;br/&gt;the hearts of wicked men on the battlefields&lt;br/&gt;and inspired them into frenzies of iniquity. The Supreme&lt;br/&gt;Personality of Godhead descended, with his&lt;br/&gt;associates, to send them back into the darkness from&lt;br/&gt;where they came and reinstate the true king of men to&lt;br/&gt;his throne of virtue. In the process the principles of&lt;br/&gt;religion were re-established and a new age dawned for&lt;br/&gt;the people of earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is on this stage that our heroes enter, descending&lt;br/&gt;from the abodes of the devas, joining the forces of the&lt;br/&gt;righteous to bring the malevolent to justice and grant&lt;br/&gt;themselves a chance of total redemption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
