			<description>From the Publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is time for the All Saints College Class of '57 Reunion. For one night we will return to the good old days when Elvis was at the top of the charts. Sock hops, hula-hoops and poodles were radioactive. Getting pinned meant something altogether different than it does these days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Class of '57 was written to be a little different than the rest of our games. First of all the 10 or 12 main suspects are all couples very much in love. Couples will be working together at times to achieve goals. They may have some secrets from each other, but overall they will be working to protect each other. This gives the game a romantic flavor. This murder mystery game is what we would call a 'clean' game. There are no affairs &amp;amp; people are basically good. This game is great for church groups and others who are worried about the possibility of offending guests. It can also be used for older teen groups!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another difference is that the murder happens before the game. Being a couples murder mystery we felt it would be too complicated to murder them both or only one. That is not to say that there won't be more murders during the evening. Those tend to happen in our games since we provide a lot of intrigue outside of the murder itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 12 player version has 6 couples and we include our 2 Extra Character Packets to expand the game up to 32. The Extra Character Packets add a little quirky flavor to the party, but not all of these 20 extra characters may be suitable for conservative groups. (Remember... these are included FREE in the 12 player version, no need to purchase them!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
