			<description>After another long gruelling day at your regular day job, your father calls you up with a rather urgent message. &amp;quot;Son, get over here right now!&amp;quot;. Upon arrival, you find that he is unable to answer his door. Using your key, you enter the door and find him on the ground in the living room helpless and in lots of pain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Things are bad, son. Real bad. I seem to have herniated my disc or something. Not only that, the bank wants to foreclose on the business. I gotta come up with 6500 dollars in 55 days. Plus I think I am going to need surgery or something, and that won't be cheap. Son, ya gotta help me!!!! Take my truck and go make as much money as you can!!!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: The player is trying to gather enough cash to save his dad's trucking business in a 55 turns. Each turn, the player moves his truck and purchases and delivers goods. He may upgrade his business throughout the game. There are also eight big events that will affect the course of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is my personal entry into the 2011 July/August Solitaire Print and Play Contest. I may develop a multiplayer version at a later time. It will be available for Vassal shortly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
