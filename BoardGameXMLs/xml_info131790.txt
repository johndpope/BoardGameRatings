			<description>From the publisher's website:'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in 3000 B.C.E., a time without the myths and legends we now take for granted &amp;mdash; because they either haven&amp;rsquo;t happend yet or are happening right now. Would-be gods and previously unheard-of monsters stalk the earth openly building armies and recruiting followers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore ancient Mesopotamia and take part in the birth of empires and the dawn of civilization itself. In the process, the players will to protect a trade caravan as it travels from Ur to Nineveh. Along the way, they&amp;rsquo;ll battle the desert sun, be attacked by bandits, and kicked by the camels they&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be protecting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While mostly adventure, this book is also a bronze-ages sourcebook for the Mesopotamian region, complete with a regional map, details on the cultures of the time, and minor rules and equipment modifications for bronze gear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thoroughly researched, Caravan is historically accurate, or at least as accurate as you can get while still having halflings running around underfoot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     50 pages of text and illustrations&lt;br/&gt;     8 pages of maps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
