							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroes of Asfar</name>
									
			<description>Heroes of Asfar is a fairly simple card game of fantasy combat (for no stated reason).  Character cards each show an illustration, name, point value, usable weapon, and special abilities (such as spell casting, thievery, immunities, or bonuses).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player begins with 6 random character cards, arranged into two ranks, and a hand of 5 weapon cards.  Players take turns hacking at each other's characters with weapon cards usable by their own characters.  The fray continues until one player has slain 150 points of opponents' characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spells, ranged weapons (reaching the second rank), and special attacks add spice to the game.  A &amp;quot;Cast&amp;quot; booklet is included, containing a paragraph of flavor text for each of the 60 characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expanded by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Heroes of Asfar: The College of Magi&lt;br/&gt;    Heroes of Asfar: The Finieous Fingers Expansion Set&lt;br/&gt;    Heroes of Asfar: The Bag of Chaos&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
