							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">C&#039;est la Vie! The Game of Lesbian Life</name>
									
			<description>A limited edition board game manufactured by Play on Words in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The game had one printing of 2,000 copies, and was stocked in bookstores across America and Canada in the mid-nineties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players travel &amp;quot;the lesbian path of life&amp;quot; through areas such as &amp;quot;coming out&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;career&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Womyn's Festival&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Lovely Lesbians Retirement Villa&amp;quot;; each area with a separate card stack. &lt;br/&gt;    Some squares have you draw a karma card, which describes a social situation and how you did in the situation. Some cards give you one karma token (e.g. &amp;quot;You listen objectively to your straight friend's problems with her stupid boyfriend. Collect one token.&amp;quot;), while some things cost you two karma tokens (e.g. &amp;quot;You see your best friend's girlfriend at a party - without your best friend - and make out with her until 4:00 am. Forfeit two tokens&amp;quot;). &lt;br/&gt;    Some squares are 'It's Time to Take Action&amp;quot; squares, which instruct you to perform some action: recite a limerick, tell about the first girl you had a crush on, do the hula, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of the game is the one with the most karma tokens at game end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
