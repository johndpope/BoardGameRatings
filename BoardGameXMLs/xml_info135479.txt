			<description>Kung Fu Panda 2 is a video game, loosely based on the film of the same name. The game was released across various platforms on May 24, 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;he gameplays of the Kung Fu Panda 2 game platforms are different from each other. In the Kinect version of the video game, the player use his or her body to move Po's body parts, and is able to perform basic kung fu moves, like basic punches, kicks and blocks. There is also a jump and double-kick ability. If the player jumps, Po will jump AND double-kick. The player can use these moves to wear out enemies. To finish the enemy, the player can use several kinds of kung fu techniques, like the flowing form and other forms. Because the player can only his or her body to move Po, the player is not able to move around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the PlayStation 3 version of the game, the player can move Po around, and they can use moves similar from the game based on the original film to defeat enemies. However, the PlayStation 3 version received negative reviews.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Kung Fu Panda 2 (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
