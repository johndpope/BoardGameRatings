			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This free-form storytelling game is intended to played on a community &amp;quot;livejournal&amp;quot; page where individual players make posts as their characters.  The game is thus played as a solitaire endeavor by a community of simultaneous players.  Characters are free to comment on other characters' posts but this is not required and does not necessarily influence play.  Characters have traits and a few Attributes that vary during play (essentially, they act as status indicators).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
