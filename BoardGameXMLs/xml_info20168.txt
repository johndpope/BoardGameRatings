							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Social Disorder</name>
									
			<description>From the West End Games online catalog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Social Disorder a fast-paced card game designed for three to six players, simulates the uncertain world of high-school social groups. Each card represents a student in a clique, such as the Lunch-Stealer Bully, the Goth Burn-Out, and the Gamer Geek. Social Disorder combines the trick-based play of classic games such as Spades and Hearts with a twist: Each player has a hidden rule, which can affect all other players. Is the suit order reversed for this hand? Can the same player not win two tricks in a row? Can you force two players to swap hands? Only you know what your rule is, and you can choose whether or not to enforce it. And, just like high school, no one knows all the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by three-time Origins-Award-winner Steven Marsh, Social Disorder takes about an hour to play per game. It comes with everything you need except friends ... just like high school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
