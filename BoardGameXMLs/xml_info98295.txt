							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Videocart-26: Alien Invasion</name>
									
			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you can experience all the excitement of your favorite arcade games right in your own living room. And it won't cost you a quarter each time you fight back an armada of aliens!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are responsible for defending the Earth against an army of alien invaders. The task is not easy. The attackers relentlessly descend toward the Earth as they fire their missile salvos in an attempt to destroy you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your player is positioned in a blast-proof trench on the Earth's surface . . . Above your player are suspended three protective barriers. Alien missiles cannot penetrate these barriers, but will destroy them bit by bit. The same is true for your missiles, so take care in firing missiles at your own barriers. As the alien batallion descends toward you, they will eventually obliterate what's left of your protective barriers when they reach them. So don't be surprised when your barriers vanish before your eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your player is destroyed by alien missile fire three times, then the game is over. In Two Player Games, the other player will be allowed to continue. The number of turns left for each player is displayed next to the player's score in the player's own color. This number is shown immediately before a player's turn begins and again when his turn ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the aliens are able to land on the Earth, the game (and humanity as well) is finished. In Alternating Two Player Games, the game is over only for the player against which the landing occurred - the other player may still continue and give Earth's inhabitants a second chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Game variations described in the manual include: One-player games, alternating two-player games, concurrent two-player games, double player missiles, and quadruple alien missiles.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
