			<description>Dungeon Party is a 3D MMOG developed by Cyanide Studio. The game was officially released May 15, 2009 globally.&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon party is a team-based online game which has been described as a combination of DotA and Fate (Fate itself is inspired from Diablo). Players can create characters of a different number of classes and take part in dungeon raids. The objective of these raids is to obtain the treasure and get to the exit of the dungeon. Two teams compete against each other for this objective. Each Dungeon contains a numerous amount of traps and dungeon guardians which either aid or hamper a teams efforts.&lt;br/&gt;This game is Windows 7 compatible. The game also seems to be more forgiving to players who have lower end internet connections as many players have reported a smooth gaming experience with less than desirable connections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dungeon Party&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
