			<description>The game board is a labyrinth with a treasure chest in the middle. Players move their large, beautiful wooden robber pawns through the maze. There are bushes in the way which can be moved to block other players when a player hits them exactly with his or her dice roll (the die shows 1-3 only). The first player to reach the treasure chest is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
