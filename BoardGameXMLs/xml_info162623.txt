			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power and Politics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book weaves together three character classes into a tapestry of politics and power. The buck, a noble-born soldier, relies on his family name as much as his rifle to assure victory for himself and his squadmates. The courtier plays at being the power behind the throne and specializes in providing support for his lord (a chosen ally) both on and off the battlefield. Finally, the sycophant is a powerful spellcaster whose abilities are derived from his service to another being whom he worships like a god. When used together, they allow a GM to run a more politically-minded game. In such a game, backgrounds are brought to the forefront and combat is married to story. Remember, sometimes it is not about who is killed but who will care if he is killed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Buck Base Class &lt;br/&gt;         A landed noble with a proper military training. He wields his influence as well as any sword and has a command of both firearms and martial weapons.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     The Courtier Base Class &lt;br/&gt;         Courtiers are the power behind the throne. They serve their lord (another player or NPC) and augment their already impressive skills. Powerful in their own right, courtier come from many walks of life and follow many paths (mundane and magical). However, the glue that binds them is their loyalty, cunning, and connections.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     The Sycophant Inquisitor Archetype &lt;br/&gt;     Sycophants, obsessive devotees of a charismatic leader, gain enhanced arcane might through their fervor. Eternal yes-men, they see their leaders as being able to do no wrong and fawn on their every word as if it were holy scripture. Sycophants lose a bit of their identities, choosing instead (consciously or unconsciously) to define their existences by their relationships to their leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
