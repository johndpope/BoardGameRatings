			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CLOWN, just when you thought it was safe to drive across the Brooklyn Bridge CLOWN is back. Yep the crazy pranksters have reemerged to terrorize law enforcement and heroes plus of course pull wacky pranks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMP, a group dangerous of psychotic individuals who like to cause terror, mayhem and death. While most villain organization seems to be out to become rich or rule the world, IMP is different. They will be rich but only due to the fee they are paid to assassinate any and everyone. They might rob a bank here or there as well but people will be injured and if they have their way they will kill some people along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
