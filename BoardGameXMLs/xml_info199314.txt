			<description>&amp;quot;Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever is the second video game based on the film Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever. Like its predecessor, Ecks vs. Sever, it is a first-person shooter on the Game Boy Advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sequel was considered better than Ecks vs. Sever, but received lower reviews because it was released later in the Game Boy Advance life cycle.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic%3A_Ecks_vs._Sever_%28video_game%29 Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever (video game)]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
