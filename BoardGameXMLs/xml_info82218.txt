The player takes control of Billy &amp;quot;Big Bang&amp;quot; Blitz, who is capable of running, jumping, and shooting. He is initially armed with a handgun, though various upgrades can be purchased from a shop. He later gains the ability to perform various powers by collecting Force, including shrinking, teleportation to previously-visited areas, flight, healing, and invincibility. The player chooses levels from a world map that consists of over forty routes. Various objectives must be met to complete the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Clash at Demonhead&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
