			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Phaethos RPG Book of Beasties Volume I is an expansion book for the Phaethos RPG. The Phaethos Book of Beasties Volume I is a 100 page full color pdf document that features an easy to navigate Table of Contents (which is completely bookmarked), black and white and full color artwork, 98 Monsters for your Phaethos adventures all of which have full stat blocks, descriptions, attack descriptions, body hit location charts and an entire section on creating your monsters from scratch. The Book of Beasties Volume I also features Random Encounter Tables based on the Monster Rating and the Environment in which the Monster is found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea behind the Phaethos RPG Book of Beasties Volume I was to provide a series of custom made monsters that could be inserted into a Phaethos campaign. In this book you will find some common fantasy monsters as well as many new ones which are indigenous to Phaethos. The Random Encounter section helps makes encounters easy and cut down on the prep time required for the GM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Monster Creation section allows you to create all of your own monsters so that your players will constantly have to be on their toes. A Monster Sheet has been included to help you flesh out your creations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
