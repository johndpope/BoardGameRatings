			<description>You&amp;rsquo;re greeted at the front door with a smile on the cashier's face and a welcoming attitude; the smells of all sorts of food invade your senses. The scent of spaghetti dances in your nose and you can almost taste the roast beef being slowly cooked and it&amp;rsquo;s almost as if the kid shaking sprinkles on their ice cream is happening right in your ear. You&amp;rsquo;ve never been this hungry and you can not take it much longer. The cashier asks for your money and you dig into your pocket looking for your wallet and as you grab it you see yourself shaking. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s okay&amp;rdquo; you think to yourself &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m almost there&amp;rdquo;. You hand the cashier your money and with a smile as warm as fresh cinnamon rolls you hear &amp;ldquo;enjoy!&amp;rdquo;. But as you walk through you start to notice something is terribly wrong. People are fighting with one another, stealing from unsuspecting victims, and devouring food for the worry that it might be gone any moment. Fear hits you suddenly as you notice a sign at the front of the buffet &amp;ldquo;NO REFUNDS!&amp;rdquo; and before you can gather your thoughts you hear someone whisper in your ear, &amp;ldquo;Are You Gonna Eat That?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Are You Gonna Eat That?&amp;rdquo; is a 2-5 player game played in about 30-45 minutes. Over the course of three rounds you will earn points by devouring the most amount of dishes at the table, but be careful as your opponents will be trying to steal your food! Food cards are placed faced down in front of you; hiding their respective point values.  Using a wide variety of action cards you will be able steal from opponents, play defensive cards, and even gross dishes removing them from play; but beware of opponents tricking you into taking their rotten foods.  Spice up your dishes by playing add-ons on your dishes or trap other players by placing add-ons of opposite flavors onto a dish causing it to be worth negative points.  Still hungry? Fill up your plates using empty plate tokens to steal even more food, all is fair game until a dish is devoured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
