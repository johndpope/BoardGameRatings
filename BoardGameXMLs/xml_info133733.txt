			<description>F-Zero: GP Legend is a futuristic racing video game for the Game Boy Advance handheld. Developed by Suzak, it was released in Japan in 2003, and in Europe and North America, in 2004.&lt;br/&gt;F-Zero: GP Legend is based on the anime of the same name. A sequel was released in 2004 titled F-Zero: Climax.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays similar to the original release of F-Zero on the Super Nintendo and uses features from F-Zero X on the Nintendo 64. The game uses the mode 7 effect to allow the background layers to rotate and scale to display the course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The boost system is similar to F-Zero X, where the player can use a boost to gain an additional burst of speed (only available from lap 2 of each race). However, this does consumes some of the machine's energy. The machine's energy can be replenished by entering pit areas that can be found on the race course.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the boost system, the machines can trigger side attacks, similar to F-Zero GX on the Nintendo Gamecube. This allows the player to attack and do damage to other machines, without damaging their own machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features 34 playable characters, 8 of them are available in Story mode, including newcomer Rick Wheeler (Ryu Suzaku in the Japanese version), the evil Black Shadow, and series hero Captain Falcon. As in earlier games, a story-driven campaign leads players through a series of futuristic races across the diverse environments of many different planets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;F-Zero: GP Legend (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
