			<description>Help Maisy find her favorite things and then take her to some of her favorite places!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maisy's Hide and Seek Adventure game is perfect for young children ready to play their fist board game!  The simple, easy to follow instructions enables players to practice these important skills:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Color matching - players roll the color die and move to the space that matches the color rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Memory - if they land on a space that pictures an object, they must try to find the chip that contains the matching object.  In order to be successful, the player needs to remember where certain objects are hidden!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking turns - a child's first game experience teaches cooperation and consideration for others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following in sequence - to be successful, the players need to follow their given path and get Maisy to her favorite place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cooperating, winning and losing graciously - an important lesson to learn early in life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 versions of play that vary in degree of difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
