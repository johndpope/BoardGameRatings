							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Striking a Balance</name>
									
			<description>Players will be able to analyze physical quantities into their fundamental units of measurement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Striking a Balance is to form balanced equations of physical units that appear in many physics formulas. Equations are formed with cards in various combinations, each card bearing a physical quantity which is broken down into its fundamental units. The winner of a round is the first person to &amp;quot;go out&amp;quot; as in Rummy, which means that the player can use all the cards in his/her hand to form complete equations. Points may be accumulated at the end of each round and the grand wazoo is the player who reaches 100 points first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;48 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
