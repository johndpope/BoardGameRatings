			<description>Each player has two six-sided dice and sixty poker chips.  Crash is a continuous gambling game.  On your turn, pick an opponent and roll one of their dice.  If it's a 1, you crashed and must pay 10 chips to the pot.  If it's not, the player who owns the die must pay the pot the number on the die.  You may then take the pot and end your turn, or choose two new dice belonging to other players and roll them.  You continue taking one more die each round until you choose to stop or crash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bogart is an earlier version of Crash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crash was included in Chief Herman's Holiday Fun Pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
