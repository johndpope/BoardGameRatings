			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dog Soul's first annual April Fool's release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, you've seen those other books by that other publisher, you know the ones; 17 Magic This and 17 Magic That... well this one was bound to happen, and we thought that it should be from somebody other than the guy with the really funny name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So here you have it! /16 1/2 Magic Codpieces!/ (It would have been 17, but there was a little bit of, well, shrinkage.) &lt;br/&gt;In this book you will find a collection of tallywhacker protective devices all designed to enhance any male proudly sporting them. From the Codstrap of Thesticles to the Codpiece of the Beast to Grimblethingy Thadpunk&amp;rsquo;s Interfacing Parsing Distributor (the fastest gnomish crotch cannon in existence), there's something for everyone in this one impressive package!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: In case you didn't figure it out, this one is recommended for a mature audience...well, at least for those who have reached adulthood according to a calendar. You can't be that mature!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
