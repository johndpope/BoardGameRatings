							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GURPS Psis</name>
									
			<description>from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's said that psychic powers are as intuitive as walking and talking. GURPS Psionic Powers went a long way toward making this true for gaming, speeding up the process of creating a psionic hero by doing all the math for you and explaining how the game mechanics work. GURPS Psis takes the next step, offering:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* A dozen templates for important psionic archetypes found in fiction, each with plenty of flexibility and open &amp;quot;slots&amp;quot; for your choice of psi capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;    * Over 100 different 25-, 50-, and 100-point sets of complementary psionic abilities, perks, skills, and techniques, ready to use on their own or with the templates.&lt;br/&gt;    * Plenty of advice to help you fit your gifts to your role . . . along with tricks to simplify how your powers appear on your character sheet and work in play.&lt;br/&gt;    * Notes on especially appropriate non-psionic advantages, disadvantages, and skills that can fill in the blanks for any psi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It makes things so easy, it will seem like we read your mind...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
