							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Quest for Amelia</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An extension to NeMoren's Vault (d20)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Quest for Amelia is a fantasy roleplaying adventure extension to NeMoren's Vault (d20), also by Fiery Dragon Productions. In NeMoren's Vault, the characters uncovered the various secrets and treasures of the late Baron Paytro NeMoren by plundering the vault beneath his estate. Clues in the vault unravelled some of the dark secrets he kept during his lifetime, and the characters should have determined that his wife Amelia was captured by Lisette and held prisoner somewhere. This adventure expands on these clues and secrets as the characters attempt to find out what really happened to Amelia and bring her back -- if she is still alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Quest for Amelia is designed for 4 characters of 2nd -3rd level and takes place within the town of Weston (as detailed in NeMoren's Vault) and the small forest located directly northwest of it. This area should be easy to drop into an existing campaign; even the minotaur's cave can be placed in any type of terrain; the dryad encounter, however, will need to be removed if the cave is not located in a forested area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
