			<description>In this funny and easy old game the players act as photo reporters. Their objective is to get the highest number of photos of some important people and then sell them, before those people travel away, making the news obsolete. To do this players roll the dice and walk in a maze like area of streets. Some major streets head towards particular places (Park, Theater, Industry, Airport, Zoo). Players roll dice and the roll of those dice decides which v.i.p. moves and where each goes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
