			<description>Dangerous Seed (デンジャラスシード) is a vertical scrolling shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1989 only in Japan. In 1990, a Sega Mega Drive version was also developed and released only in Japan.&lt;br/&gt; The player assumed control of three separate ships operated by three separate pilots: Alpha ship is piloted by Yugo Tyrone, Beta ship is piloted by Belle Vogato, and Gamma ship is piloted by Kenny Crawford. Each ship had a different firing pattern that the player could switch between when the ships were formed together as The Moon Diver. Their mission is to quell an alien invasion spanning all of the Milky Way and destroy the aliens' headquarters: the Danger Seed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dangerous Seed&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
