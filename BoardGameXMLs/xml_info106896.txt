							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cardian Ambassadors Trading Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Cardian Ambassadors TCG is a 2-player collectable trading card game, where you and your opponent take the role of competing Cardian Ambassadors, using a large variety of extraordinary creatures, called Cardians.  Your goal is to defeat the opponent's Cardian by using various elemental attacks. There are Support cards, Action cards, and Field cards to assist you in battle. After a player loses $1,000 of their play money, the opposing player declares victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both you and your opponent will each need a 54-card deck, damage counters to keep track of damage on the different Cardians in play, and $1,000 or more in play money. A player begins their turn by first drawing a card. On each turn, the player can do several things: Use a Support card, play an Action card, play a Field card, use an attack/special move, or just simply pass. Some Cardians can also Morph into a more powerful monster as long as the card has been in play for at least three turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support cards are very useful, as they aid the player and add a twist to the game, but must be discard cafter use. But Action cards on the other hand never expire and can only be removed from its space by certain Support cards or Cardian moves. Field cards allow monsters to use special attacks or moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
