			<description>The game presents the player with a blank screen to play with. The player controls a flashing cursor which can be moved at will over the canvas. Pressing the fire button causes the first piece of the puzzle to slide out on to the playing area. This piece can then be slid around the screen to a place of the players choosing. A miniature preview of the completed image acts as a guide for the player and also highlights the piece of the puzzle that the player is currently controlling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition there were also tiles that contained bombs which needed to be ejected from the playing field within a set time limit or the player would lose a life and need to restart the level. To remove these tiles from the board the player would slide them towards one of the holes that periodically appear in the sides of the playing area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every level features a new picture:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Ronald Reagan&lt;br/&gt;    * Margaret Thatcher&lt;br/&gt;    * Neil Kinnock&lt;br/&gt;    * Clive Sinclair&lt;br/&gt;    * Alan Sugar&lt;br/&gt;    * Humphrey Bogart&lt;br/&gt;    * Charles and Diana&lt;br/&gt;    * Fergie and Andrew&lt;br/&gt;    * Mick Jagger&lt;br/&gt;    * Marilyn Monroe&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Split Personalities,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
