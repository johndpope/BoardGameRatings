			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mein Zombie is a flexible and expandable 1:1 rule system for recreating the massive Zombie infection. Designed to be used with miniature scales from 15 up to 28mm, it is based around out innovative Drop-In game system. Players from novice to veteran will find it easy to customize the game to their particular gaming style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This player-friendly approach to war gaming builds around solid and easily learned basic rules, which present an excellent balance of playability and historical accuracy.
