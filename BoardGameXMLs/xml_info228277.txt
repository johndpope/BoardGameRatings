							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Climate Change in Copenhagen, December 2009</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game will take you to Copenhagen where you will participate in the negotiations trying to formulate a global climate treaty. These negotiations have been going on for years, but have failed to produce a treaty that the majority of polluters are willing to sign. There is great optimism that Copenhagen will be different. As a result, many heads of state have chosen to attend the final few days of the meeting, either to increase the chance of success or to insure their national interests are properly represented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For most students in this game, your role is not that of a scientist but of a politician. The educational training of your character may be similar to your current academic major. Your character may have studied economics, political science, history, or even art. There are a number of questions that all conference participants need to understand. Without a solid understanding of these, you may be misled by things you read or the arguments you hear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
