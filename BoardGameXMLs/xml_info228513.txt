			<description>A One Round High Level Living City Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your companions have been traveling outside of Ravens Bluff for two days. You are still not sure why you have agreed to this. You keep running it over in your mind. How has Mayor Thoden convinced you to assist Field Marshal Blacktree in recovering a lost artifact called the Orb of Protection? Maybe it is your sense of duty, maybe your adventuring spirit, maybe you want to help protect some of the poor convicts who have been stuck in the mines for months now, maybe you think this is an opportunity to gain great wealth and power, or maybe you just need to get out of Ravens Bluff for a few days. Whatever the reason, you are now headed for the entrance of a mining cave not far from Lord Uldred Deepaxe&amp;rsquo;s keep. It is there Lord Blacktree has been looking for the Orb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
