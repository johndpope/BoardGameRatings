			<description>Quote: This new educational game was designed by the CBC to enable listeners of all ages to better visualize the mobilization of this country's vast resources in the gigantic war effort in which we are now engaged. Its purpose is also to show the problems associated with the transporting of munitions and supplies of all kinds to Great Britain. The part which Canada is playing in the whole war, and in the crucial Battle of the Atlantic in particular, will undoubtedly be better appreciated by both young and old after playing this game and digesting some of the information contained here.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The contents consist of one cardstock sheet, 14&amp;quot; by 35&amp;quot;, printed in three colours and folded into four panels like a menu. Six markers are available to be cut out from one margin of the board, as well as a six-sided top to be used as a die. One side of the sheet consists of a map of Canada, the North Atlantic and Great Britain. The other side of the sheet contains instructive data, graphs, charts and other appropriate propaganda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
