			<description>From the first page of the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elturgard has fallen. From the capital of Elturel the fallen Order of Torm, thoroughly corrupted by the Order of the Blue Flame and agents of Najara, has declared an alliance with Netheril. Its borders closed, rumors are rampant of mutagenic plagues changing the populace into monstrous beasts and undead that do not fear the light of day. The remnants of the exiled government have appealed to all enemies of Netheril to aid in retaking the country by starting with a direct strike at the capital itself in an effort to purify and reinvigorate a despoiled Companion. As Cormyr, Myth Drannor and other great powers rally, many see this as the first battle in the coming war with the Empire of Shadows that may result in the Desolation of the Realms.&lt;br/&gt;A two-round continuous-play Living Forgotten Realms Battle Interactive set in Elturgard for characters of the Heroic and Paragon tiers (levels 1-20, but all characters must be of the same tier and able to play at the table's chosen Adventure Level).This battle interactive will allow more opportunities to interact with other tables and some groups may find themselves temporarily shorthanded. You should allow at least 9 hours of play time to run this event (we recommend two 4-hour back-to-back slots with a 1-hour break in the middle). This adventure is combat-intensive, and the combat encounters may be more difficult than those in a typical LFR adventure. You will need good resource management, strong teamwork both at your table and among the entire interactive, as well as a bit of luck in order to succeed. We recommend that at least three of the characters at the table be members of the same Adventuring Company or meta-organization. This adventure takes place after the events of ELTU4-4, SPEC5-1 and SPEC5-2. Play of the prior adventures is recommended, but is neither required nor assumed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
