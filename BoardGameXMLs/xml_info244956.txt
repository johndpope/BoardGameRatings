			<description>Jewelers Row is a new Button Shy Wallet game in the limited &amp;quot;Select&amp;quot; Line. Consisting of only 18 cards, a rulebook and bi-fold wallet, Jewelers Row brings the excitement of app-inspired &amp;quot;Match-3&amp;quot; gameplay to your tabletop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep beneath the street of Jewelers Row, gnomish gem crafters forge intricate pieces coveted throughout the realm. As one of these gnomish craftsmen, you will specialize in two prized gem types. Be careful not to use too many of the same gem in one piece, or customers will question their authenticity. You can always shift the blame to your competition, though; they&amp;rsquo;re certainly doing the same to you&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will each take turns placing cards containing a grouping of gems next to, or on top of other gem cards, hopefully scoring points on each placement. Points are scored when 3 or 4 of the same gem type align, but if you reach 5 or more of the same, you will start to lose points. Losing points isn't always a bad thing in Jewelers Row, however, as just before you score you will send the points in your lowest scoring gem color to your neighbor. Players then score for their top two gems, and only those two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you try to maximize your highest two gem types, you will want to watch your neighbor on your left to try to knock them down a notch, and watch the neighbor on your right to see the damage they're sending your way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
