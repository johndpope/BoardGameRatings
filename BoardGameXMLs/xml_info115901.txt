							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Witch Player Class</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever thought that there is an important fantasy character missing from your games?&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever wanted a darker alternative to the wizard?&lt;br/&gt;Do you want a new take on the leader role?&lt;br/&gt;If so, The Witch is the class you need!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The witch has learned the secrets of arcane magic, not through careful study and tutelage like the Wizard, but through uncontrolled experimentation and creative use of the magical forces around her. On the battlefield, she uses a lot of spells that manipulate her foes to give her allies the upper hand and some that guide her party to victory. She induces fear in her enemies and uses her mystical power for healing. She warps the enemies' bodies and pollutes their minds. She may not be the deadliest force by herself, but once she has had her way with a foe, it could be crushed by anyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 18 page color product contains everything you expect from a player class: a choice of class feature, at least 4 powers of each level, 3 paragon paths, 10 feats, 3 magic items, and even details on how to make NPC witches. It also introduces curse spells: daily powers that inflict the enemy with curses that don't end with an encounter. Bewitch your GM or your players with The Witch Player Class by Svalin Games!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
