			<description>Listed on the box as &amp;ldquo;World&amp;rsquo;s Liveliest Family Game&amp;rdquo; &amp;amp; &amp;ldquo;A Game of Action&amp;rdquo; Snatch is almost identical to the traditional card game Spoons. It uses a deck of 40 cards with 4 each of 1 through 10 and a set of wooden dowels to replace the spoons. There are two notable differences between it and Spoons. In scoring the player caught out gets a letter marked against then, first the letter &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; then &amp;ldquo;N&amp;rdquo; and so on the game ends when one player goes out having spelled SNATCH, the winner being the player with the fewest letters. The second difference is that a greater number of sets are used in play compared to the number of players. 3 players 5 sets, 4 players 7 set and for the rest it also uses 3 more sets than players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
