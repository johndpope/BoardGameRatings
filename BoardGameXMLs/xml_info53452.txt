Barbaric Oshalogwan Elves roam the plains and hills. The lowering brows of the Worheim Mountains hide the innumerable tunnels of the secretive Dwarves. Crennian Elves, onetime servants of the mysterious Qaali, flit through the shadows of ancient woods. The villages of the Talonian Humans spread south along the great Kriegstrom river.&lt;br/&gt;All these races and more walk the streets of Dinas Ffordd in an uneasy truce, come to trade at the busy docks, worship at the mighty Teithian Cathedral, or work in the enormous Millrace. The &amp;quot;Town of the Ways&amp;quot; is the keystone of a peace that has lasted eight centuries. But now cracks are appearing...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your characters have come to Dinas Ffordd to stay. They have fortunes to seek, jobs or connections to exploit, businesses or families to protect. When disturbing events occur, the bold must step forward to defend the helpless and discover the truth: Who would want to break a peace that has proven so profitable to everyone?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What threatens Dinas Ffordd threatens you. Come inside, and fight for what matters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WorldWorks leads the industry in beautiful, downloadable cardstock scenery for games of all kinds. When you buy a WorldWorks adventure module, you don't just get a great adventure. You get new and unique model sets to fit out your tacticals, dress up your tabletop and bring your game to life!

Any given rumour could be a blatant lie, a mixed-up tale, or a crucial clue -- and each player hears different things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Illustration Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the best classic module tradition, the DM gets a book of 20 original illustrations to be shown to players at the right moment. Drawn in loving detail by Matthew Cuenca in the Celtic style of the Northern Kingdoms.&lt;br/&gt;And that doesn't even cover the adventure itself - a tale of mystery, bloodshed, and magic that will require a quick wit, a strong arm, and the savvy to know which is called for. Come discover the WorldWorks difference in adventure modules today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
