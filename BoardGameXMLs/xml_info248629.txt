			<description>In I'll Take the Case you are an attorney and take cards into your hand trying to gather clients, evidence, witnesses and paperwork to solve cases available to all players at the table. The more difficult the case you solve, the more reputation you gain. When all the cases are solved, the attorney with the highest reputation wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card in the player's hands has law related trivia or facts based relevant to Bar Exam questions. Great as a learning-break for law students or kids interested in the law.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are given a starting hand and a selection of cases are available on the table for anyone to solve. By taking a single action during rotating turns, players either take a card, perform an action card, or solve a case. With a hand limit, and ability to take cards from the discard, there is strategy in what card you may or may not want to discard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cases require a mix of evidence, paperwork and witness cards to solve. Collect the correct mix in your hand and you can solve the case and gain the reputation. When all the cases are solved, the player with the most reputation wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
