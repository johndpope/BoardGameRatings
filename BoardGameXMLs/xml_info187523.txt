			<description>モリヤウォーズ (Moriya Wars: Episode II) is a hidden identity game in which each player has different victory conditions. To keep it from being too easy to determine who is which character based on what you do in the game, players need to select actions based on the dice rolled in the game, so feel free to blame the dice when you &amp;quot;have&amp;quot; to do something that seems like it's leading someone toward victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
