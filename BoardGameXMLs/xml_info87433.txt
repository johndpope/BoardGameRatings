			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unknown viruses are spreading like wildfire across the world. You, as newly-elected head of the World Health Organization, must lead the fight against the new diseases, find ways to prevent the spread of the contagion, research and develop cures while trying to minimize civic unrest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has strategy and arcade elements. It is played in real time. The player is presented with a world map showing the different infection sources. There are different choices to limit the spread of the infection, from quarantining the area to using nuclear bombs to sterilize the place. The player can also order samples to be picked up in infected zones. The game then enters its arcade sequence, where the player must pick up virus elements floating around in a petri dish and assemble them to form an antivirus. Once an antivirus is made, it can be tested (often with horrible side effects such as lungs liquefaction or brain haemorrage), then distributed to the infected areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distributing antiviruses with a lot of side effects and using scorched earth policies can result in the rise of public unrest. If it rises too high, the player can be sacked (and the game is over).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
