			<description>A childrens' card game.  The object is to be the first to get rid of all your cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dealer shuffles the pack and deals the required number of cards to each player.  He spreads out the &amp;quot;spare&amp;quot; cards, face up, in the centre of the table.  On their turn a player turns up his top card and tries to place it on any of the &amp;quot;spare&amp;quot; cards in ascending or descending order.  If he can't follow the sequence they place the card face up next to his own pile. Other players who can't play a card on the &amp;quot;spare&amp;quot; cards can instead play a card in seqence onto any of the other player's face-up cards.  If they can't, they put the card in their own face-up pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player places a card incorrectly the other players shout &amp;quot;Folly&amp;quot; and they each give you a card from their face-down piles to add to your pile.  When your face-down pile runs out, turn your face-up pile face-down and carry on.  The first player to get rid of all his cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
