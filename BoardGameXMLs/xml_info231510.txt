			<description>The government of Norway as set in motion a plan to create a national railway system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It cannot do it alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will invest and run the network, with the government keeping its share of the profits.&lt;br/&gt;As soon as the government has paid its debt on one of the 10 railway lines, the government nationalizes the line and players get a bonus but they will not run it anymore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players also try to fill the lines up so they can operate, via cities and towns.&lt;br/&gt;When a line is full, it pays out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the government gets the 7th line.&lt;br/&gt;All other lines are then bought by the government and players tally their cash.&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most cash wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
