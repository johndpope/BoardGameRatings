							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SAPOS Y CENTELLAS (SPARKS AND TOADS)</name>
									
			<description>In SAPOS Y CENTELLAS (for the moment will be only available in Spanish), from 2 to 8 players shall compete to achieve victory trough casting powerful spells and throwing magic artefacts and toads at their rivals. Also, it is crucial to accumulate valuable cards and to try to keep them until the end of every game to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONTENTS&lt;br/&gt;SAPOS Y CENTELLAS includes 92 game cards, 20 cardboard &amp;ldquo;orbs&amp;rdquo;, 1 cardboard coin, and one manual inside the game box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CARDS&lt;br/&gt;The game features 4 different kinds of playing cards: special, passive, toad and unique cards.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;-Special cards: These cards hold various magical properties. Using them can result in the user discarding some of his worst cards in order to obtain better ones, in each player being obliged to hand one card to the person at his right, and in some other outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Passive cards: These cards cannot be used but only discarded if desired. Among them we find the Spark Cards, which grant points to a player if he keeps some of them until the end of a game. Other passive cards will allow its holder to duplicate a Sparks Card or may reveal someone&amp;rsquo;s hand to every other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Toad cards: There are Green Toads, Blue Toads, Red Toads, Yellow Toads and Poisonous Toads. These cards may be exchanged for other cards, randomly chosen from any rival&amp;rsquo;s hand. They may also be kept by a player to gather an &amp;ldquo;all coloured toad combination&amp;rdquo;, which yields 100 points at the end of a game, or an &amp;ldquo;all five toad combination&amp;rdquo;, which yields 200 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Unique cards: There is only one type of card in the entire game under this category, the HOURGLASS. Both in the front and the back, HOURGLASS cards display the picture of an hourglass. There are six units of this type of card, and all of them are randomly located among the second half of the draw deck in every game. When an HOURGLASS is uncovered, the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
