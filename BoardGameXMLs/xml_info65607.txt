Each Radio Flash spin results in a code which causes different things to happen during your voyage. i.e. roll the letter k (-.-) and be subjected to a blizzard that requires you to go back 2 spaces. Some squares have 2 letters in the codes which have differing effects. J(.---)Q(--.-) results in,  on the next spin requiring you to change course and take the Western Course via Cook and Fiji Islands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You move your ship from port beginning in Bermuda, to the North Pole by either the Western or Eastern route. These routes can go all around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the player must spin exactly enough to reach the North Pole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
