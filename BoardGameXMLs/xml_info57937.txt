			<description>Generals planned for it. Gamers gamed it. Populations feared it, but it never happened. The final confrontation of ideologies, technologies, and superpowers died with a whisper as the blocks of the Berlin Wall crumbled. What never happened, though, certainly could have happened. Millions of soldiers were poised to engage on land sea and air in what would have been the most devastating war in history. Super-high-tech jet fighters, tactical nuclear weapons, tanks and men would have levelled Western and Central Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adam Starkweather (Fire in the Sky) and Andy Nunez (Cactus Throne) team up to bring you the ultimate simulation of NATO vs the Warsaw Pact on a scale not seen since the 1970's days of the Next War. Can the New Soviet Man defeat the Arsenal of Democracy? Super detailed with lots of chrome, you will have all the options and forces available to both sides, with doctrine updated by revelations of strategy and tactics brought to light after the collapse of the Soviet Union.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes land and air combat games that can be played separately or combined. A separate naval combat game is planned as an expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will include two 36 page rulebooks, one each for the land and air combat games. The land game has two 22 x 34 maps and the air game has a third 22 x 34 map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
