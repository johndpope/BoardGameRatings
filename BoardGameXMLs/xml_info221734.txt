							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hammer Heads</name>
									
			<description>The objective of the game is to smash the gnomes coming from the holes in the game area. The player controls a hammer with the mouse, and clicking on the gnomes reduces their hearts, displayed on the bottom of the gnome, depending on the power of the hammer. The default hammer takes away one heart, but more powerful hammers can be bought at the shop. There are various gnomes in the game, with different health and characteristics. Care must be taken to avoid clicking on traps, such as bombs. The player starts with five hearts, which is reduced when a click misses, a gnome escapes, or a trap is activated. They can be recovered by clicking on the hearts dropped by gnomes, or purchasing them from the shop. The maximum amount of hearts can be raised by making a purchase at the shop as well. If all of the hearts run out, the game is over.&lt;br/&gt; - From Wilipedia &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammer_Heads&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammer_Heads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
