							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Settlement Fight</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Settlement Fight (sometimes abbreviated as SF) is a massively multiplayer online  browser-based strategy game, similar to Civilization IV in concept. After registering as a user, you can build mines to earn resources such as Gold, Lumber, Metal and Crops, which you use to build or upgrade buildings or military units. In your Town Hall you can upgrade or build buildings such as Barracks, Stables, Warehouses, Granaries and many others. After a few weeks in to the game, it's even possible to create a second settlement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Settlement Fight is currently in the seventh week of its open Beta stage, and has grown to include nearly 90 users, and the forum boards have over 3,400 posts.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was created solely by computer programmer Peter Hurford, and he pays for the upkeep of the game's server by money from Google AdSense and Project Wonderful ads running on the site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Settlement Fight&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
