			<description>A One Round Adventure for the Living City&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The past week has been nothing but rain and bad weather. Then, just before dawn this day, the clouds broke and the sun came out. By mid-morning the city was alive and the air was crisp and fresh. A pleasant offshore breeze helped to air out all of the damp, and the mood of the city seemed to improve by the minute. As the good mood was catching, you decided that it would be a good time to get out and do a few errands. So after getting your armor polished, weapons cleaned, prayers delivered, and spells memorized, you began to just wander about, enjoying the sun&amp;rsquo;s gentle warmth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
