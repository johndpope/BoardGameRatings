			<description>For Expedition to Castle Ravenloft&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the PDF introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Adventure for Four to Six 7th-Level Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In October 2006, game designers revised and expanded the 1st edition I6: Ravenloft module and called it Expedition to Castle Ravenloft. Shorn of the whole Demiplane of Dread, Ravenloft returned to the adventure&amp;rsquo;s roots. Dungeon Masters (DMs) can now run the new Expedition to Castle Ravenloft as a campaign instead of as a single short adventure, thus expanding on and building the sense of horror until the climactic encounter with Count Strahd. Within that campaign, you have room for your own shorter adventures, since different patrons can send the PCs on missions either to help defeat Strahd or to hinder his defeat. Even the vicious count himself can become a patron for the PCs, at least for a while.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure for 7th-level player characters (PCs) is designed to be one of those short missions. It fits into the lands of Barovia and connects to existing story elements, while taking the PCs off on a tangent. It can be very dangerous, though, and failure can mean death for the PCs even if they defeat all the creatures they meet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
