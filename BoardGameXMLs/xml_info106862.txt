			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hellcat Ace is an exciting and challenging three dimensional combat flying simulation of World War II air battles in the Pacific.  The game player sits in the cockpit of a WWII fighter and uses the realistic out-of-the-cockpit graphic view to maneuver his aircraft through a series of combat fighter tactics.  The game is played in a three dimensional airspace.  The objective is to establish a machine gun firing position on the enemy aircraft and shoot it down.  However, the enemy aircraft can and will outmaneuver the game player and shoot him down!  This is no &amp;quot;Sunday Flying&amp;quot; simulation!  It requires the concentration and hand-eye coordination of real combat fighter pilot flying!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fourteen combat scenarios from Pearl Harbor to Iwo Jima and four different skill levels are available.  The game features bailouts, ocean ditching, limited ammunition, night missions, and combat flying maneuvers.  One to four players can compete in this exciting simulation for the distinction of being the World's Greatest Fighter Pilot!  Step up to this challenge and show you have the &amp;quot;Right Stuff&amp;quot; of a real combat fighter pilot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
