							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sufficiently Advanced, Second Edition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sufficiently Advanced is a transhuman roleplaying game of the far future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humanity has been reconstructed by time and technology. Wield incredible technological enhancements and thousands of years of expertise, or the ability to mold the story of the game. Play a digital intelligence with remote-controlled robot drones, a diplomatic team that shares a group-mind, a soldier infused with nanotechnology, or even a living starship. Play an Old-Worlder witnessing our fantastic universe for the first time, or a Masquerader taking on different identities each day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This second edition runs on an entirely new diceless system. What consequences you are willing to accept in order to win? Or, when you are outmatched, can your failure help your team succeed? Use Plots and Projects to change the world, and force Complications on your characters now to warp the plot in their favor later on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover five different futures: To The Stars, where you form a first-contact team reconnecting with the lost seeds of humanity. The Divide, full of espionage and intrigue, where trust is hard to find and the sides are ever shifting. The Powder Keg, a universe tumbling into a war that may mean the end of everything. Sublight, where secret societies champion their causes by transmitting their operatives across the stars. The Patent Office, where your team of Inspectors seeks to protect humanity from its own worst excesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The future is bright, but not without danger. Come explore it with us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
