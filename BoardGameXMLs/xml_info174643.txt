							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mexico Ablaze: A Solitaire Game of the Mexican-American War (1846-1848).</name>
									
			<description>BACKGROUND: Mexico Ablaze is semi-historical simulation of the Mexican-American War (1846-1848). The Game begins shortly after the United States of America (USA) and Mexico have begun hostilities near the border of the Rio Grande. The Mexican Army is now building up their forces to kick the United States out of Mexico. The US must capture enough Mexican controlled Settlements before the Mexican Army is able to effectively mobilize an overwhelming force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Player takes command of the United States Forces in Mexico. The Player&amp;rsquo;s Objective is to attempt to capture three or more of the five Key Mexican Controlled Settlements of Monterrey, Buena Vista, Vera Cruz, Tampico and Mexico City before the &amp;ldquo;Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo&amp;rdquo; Campaign Card is Drawn. If the Mexicans capture 3 of the four US Settlements of Fort Texas, Laredo, Corpus Christi or San Patricio, they win. Also, if the US has not captured three of the four Key Mexican Settlements and the &amp;ldquo;Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo&amp;rdquo; Campaign Card was played, the Mexicans Win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME FEATURES: Mexico Ablaze features many colorful game counters of the various Unit types that fought in the Mexican War, including individual Heroic Officers that later served in the Civil War. Battles can be fought on a large Battle Mat and includes assaults on fortified settlements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MEXICO ABLAZE can be found at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.berserkergames.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.berserkergames.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
