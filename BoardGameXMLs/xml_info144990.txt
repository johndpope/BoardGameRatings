			<description>Stac-tac-toe is a variation on the traditional tic-tac-toe game. Instead of being able to play into any one of the nine positions, a play must be made into one of the three &amp;quot;columns.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The columns may be stacked as high as desired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all of the beads have been played, then a player can split a substack ( 1 to number in stack) from any stack, and then move that substack of beads to any position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First player to make 3 in a row wins, or play for a score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The beads have a hole in the top and a post sticking out of the bottom. So the beads stack onto the board without the need for a post.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The boxed game includes rules, and a board. In addition each player has five &amp;quot;beads&amp;quot; and a peg to keep score. The player colors are yellow and orange. The playing board is black.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
