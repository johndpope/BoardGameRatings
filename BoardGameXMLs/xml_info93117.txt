							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ART 2.0 Tabletop Role-playing System</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ART is the tabletop role-playing system first popularized in Legendary Lives and later in Lost Souls. The ART system takes it name from the Action Results table, the mechanism used for all task resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ART 2.0 builds on the innovations of the original ART system, creatng a system that is just as easy to use but even more flexible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author's Note&lt;br/&gt;Through the years, the ART system has gone through several variations. The table even went away entirely in Khaotic and Crimes People Play. For ART 2.0, I wanted to return to the action results. I also wanted a system worthy of the &amp;quot;no calculator required&amp;quot; logo that was on the cover of the first edition of Legendary Lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To accomplish this, I've gotten rid of the roll required, column shifts, and couting columns. Instead of the narrator adjusting the roll for the difficulty, the difficulty is front loaded. A Great roll will now remain a Great result, and every action, no matter how difficulty, has the full range of 10 possible outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
