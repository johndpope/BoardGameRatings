			<description>A supplement for Primitive&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brand New Worlds...&lt;br/&gt;... of Ancient Possibility&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have your Primitive games been lacking a certain something? Have you asked yourself what kind of adventure will get my tribe of cave-dwellers out of this rut? Have you wondered what sort of enhancements you can make to your characters to make them more exciting (and perhaps more powerful)? Record of Threats is the book you've been missing. Included within these pages are rules governing dinosaurs, monsters, equipment, new qualities, and adventure ideas like you've never seen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is not a complete game; it is supplemental materials for the game Primitive. That being said, a lot of the information here is presented in a way that you can use in other games and stories. This book is merely an idea repository; the contents are what you make of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
