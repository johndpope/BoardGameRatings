			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dhuran; a foreboding planet abandoned by the gods. 500 years after the gods rained fire and brimstone upon the land, leaving the few survivors to fend for themselves, secrets are being uncovered. The new civilization of the now godless Dhuran find the malevolent spirits of their long-dead ancestors hunting their descendant bloodline. As if being accosted by the spirits of their ancestors isn&amp;rsquo;t enough, tears are opening between the mortal and chaos realms, pouring demons, enslavers, and the undead into the world. Though the people have managed to live and grow since that apocalyptic event, they now fight against the denizens of a planet that wants them dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Become a warrior and scour the land, protecting your kin and their allies. Fight back against the evil that spills across the land. Raise your sword in defiance; harness the corrupting power of the spirit realm and strike down the chaos; scribe the chaos runes and use the realm&amp;rsquo;s power against itself; use alchemical knowledge to launch grenades in the face of your foe; take on the role of a hunter seeking out the plagued beings that cross the land; or fight in the name of the gods that left you behind as a crusader determined to bring the gods back to Dhuran. In ANCIENT WORLD, you fight for the survival of those around you: drow, dwarf, half-drow, halfling, and human; you either find victory or become a victim of the chaos your ancestors created, because everything you don&amp;rsquo;t understand, can and will kill you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside the ANCIENT WORLD PLAYER&amp;rsquo;S GUIDE you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     An introduction to the history of Dhuran and the current state of the Known Lands.&lt;br/&gt;     Five character races.&lt;br/&gt;     New Edges and Hindrances.&lt;br/&gt;     A change to Arcane Backgrounds with four new options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PLAYER&amp;rsquo;S GUIDE is designed for those who only want to create characters for the ANCIENT WORLD setting and is suitable for virtually any dark fantasy setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
