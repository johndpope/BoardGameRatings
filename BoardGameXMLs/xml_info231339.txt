			<description>An epic 5th edition adventure for 20th level characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How many times have you started a campaign and it dissolved before you reached the top tier? How many builds have you made, all of them assuming reaching level 20, but you have never managed to try them out? Put your regular campaign on hold and see what happens when PCs reach level 20!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finders Keepers is an epic Dungeons and Dragons adventure, set in Forgotten Realms and beyond. The stakes are high: the location of one of the legendary Books of Keeping has been discovered, and now various powers of the universe vie for control over that power&amp;hellip; Devils, demons and fallen angels; the mighty shall fall and who is going to be left smelling the ashes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure starts with a fight with an ancient red dragon. Then things escalate and your players will have their 20th level spells, powers, and skills tested! Battle the game's most powerful beings, visit distant planes and make world-shaping decisions! The fate of Toril is in their hands...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
