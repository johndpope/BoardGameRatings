			<description>Herman is Herman Lindqvist, Swedish journalist and author. He has written many books on Swedish history, most of them not well received by scholars. However, a lot of people read his books and he is an important part of the booming interest in history in Sweden. This game was however designed by Camilla Borgstr&amp;ouml;m, also a journalist, with Mr. Lindqvist just acting as figurehead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is about answering questions on Swedish history, and there is also a gambling mechanism. The gameboard is colourful with portraits of kings and queens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;Gameboard&lt;br/&gt;5 tiles&lt;br/&gt;23 king cards&lt;br/&gt;750 question cards&lt;br/&gt;140 money chits&lt;br/&gt;1 die&lt;br/&gt;rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
