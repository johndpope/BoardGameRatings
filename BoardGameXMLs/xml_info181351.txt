			<description>Pro Religione et Libertate (PRL) is an operational level wargame expansion for Red Sash Games' 2010 title Remember Limerick! The latter covers the war between King James II and King William III in Ireland, from 1689-1691. PRL expands the game to cover the Dutch invasion of England in 1688 (a.k.a. the Glorious Revolution) and the fighting in Scotland that took place in parallel with the war in Ireland, 1689-1692.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PRL belongs to Red Sash Games' Lace Wars series of 17th and 18th Century operational wargames and uses the same scales (units are battalions and regiments, map distances are 4 leagues per hex, turns are 3 weeks each).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PRL has scenarios for 2 players. These allow the players to fight the invasion of 1688 and the Scottish campaign. When combined with Remember Limerick! up to 4 people can play. There are 2 campaign scenarios, one starting in 1688 and one in 1689.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
