							<name  sortindex="3">A New Game of Russia versus Turkey</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Russia versus Turkey</name>
									
			<description>Extrapolated from &amp;quot;Play the Game&amp;quot; by Brian Love;  The game Russia versus Turkey is played by any even number of players who are either Russian or Turk. They sit in alternating seats around the board. Each player has a marker placed on the home port and two tokens placed in the pool. The Russian is the aggressor and moves first. Whoever starts rolls and then moves. Different squares have different instructions that must be followed when landed on. If you land on a space that an opponent is on you are repelled back to the space you started your move on and you lose your turn. Many spaces cause you to lose tokens to the pool, lose a turn, return to port etc.  Victory is achieved by the side that has a majority of force in the enemies port at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
