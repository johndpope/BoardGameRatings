			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boxer Rebellion: Admiral Seymour's Relief Attempt features 10 action-packed historical scenarios from the first phase of the Boxer Rebellion.  Fanatical Boxers, The Chinese Imperial Army and a train bound Allied force battle it out on the way to Peking. Also featured are three scenarios from pre-European involvement where the Chinese Army tried to suppress the growing Boxer movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenarios:&lt;br/&gt; 1. Senlou Temple - October 18, 1899 Chinese Army vs. Boxers&lt;br/&gt; 2. Laishui Boxing Grounds - May 16, 1900  Chinese Army vs. Boxers&lt;br/&gt; 3. Boxer Revenge - May 18, 1900 Chinese Army vs. Boxers&lt;br/&gt; 4. Skirmish on the Rails - June 11, 1900&lt;br/&gt; 5. Anting Station - June 13, 1900&lt;br/&gt; 6.

All scenarios are played ona 4x6' table. Give it a try!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other sections include:&lt;br/&gt;- Uniform inforamtion&lt;br/&gt;- History of the period!&lt;br/&gt;- Information on the Chinese and European Forces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
