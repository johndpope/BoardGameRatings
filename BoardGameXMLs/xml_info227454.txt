			<description>Don't let Troll's adorableness fool you; those clawed hands are for more than just clutching his teddy bear. As a thief, pillage the beast's den and steal as much of his gold as possible before he wakes. Troll's hoard holds treasure enough to make even paupers into kings. &lt;br/&gt;But be careful, should he catch you carrying away his hard-stolen riches...Well, Sleepy Trolls also make terrifying Angry Trolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This light, press your luck game pits player against player as they attempt to steal the sleeping troll's gold. The game begins with one player drawing cards from a single, 99 card deck in the center of the table. He or she may grab any number of cards, but if an Angry Troll cards is pulled, he or she loses all of the drawn cards from that turn. Angry Troll Cards may be mitigated by one of the limited Sword and Shield Cards in the deck. Players may also steal from their fellow players using special action cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when players have gone through the entire deck. The player with the most amount of gold claims victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
