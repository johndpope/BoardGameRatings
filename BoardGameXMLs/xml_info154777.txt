			<description>Micro Quest is an adventure micro-game consisting of only 30 high quality cards and 30 custom meeples.  Players will utilize the Market Economy and Quest Cards to gather the kings forces of highly trained Knights, Thieves, Clerics, and Mages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your land is under siege and the king has commanded you and your compatriots to acquire, train, and supply battle ready troops to support the war effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Micro Quest, players compete for the king's favor (aka: victory points) by managing, training, and paying tribute with troops to support the king's army. &lt;br/&gt; The game play consists of 3 phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Market Phase - players vie for control over the available units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Quest Phase - players train their units by completing epic quests, activating powerful skills, and obtaining glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Tribute Phase - players compete in an all-out battle for the 'King's Favor' and must be careful managing units in order to pay proper tribute to the king.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
