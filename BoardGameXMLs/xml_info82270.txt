							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Earthlight (1988)</name>
									
			<description>Earthlight is a computer game published for the ZX Spectrum in 1988 by Firebird Software. It was written by Pete Cooke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes the role of an alien explorer from the star-system of Arcturus, called Slaatn, who has been drawn off-course by a beam of energy from Earth and has had to make a landing on the moon. Slaatn must neutralise the box-like transmitters and thus eliminate the force field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earthlight is a shooter featuring parallax scrolling and shadow effects, a novelty for the Spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Critical response&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CRASH awarded the game 90%, with the reviewers impressed with every aspect of the game, particularly the 3D shaded graphics and the sound effects.  The gameplay was compared to that of Uridium.  Your Sinclair awarded 8/10, describing it as a polished game but without the depth of Pete Cooke's previous releases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Earthlight (computer game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
