			<description>Similar to standard bingo except each person picks one of the words from their board and has to relate a story or give advice to the mother to be. The bingo game is actually one of several games that come in the box. Other games include &amp;quot;Guess the waistline of the mother to be&amp;quot;, where the mother stands in the middle of the room and everyone guesses her waist in inches. &amp;quot;Last woman standing&amp;quot; where the women receive chips with baby shower related words and every time someone says their own word by accident they lose a chip. Last woman to have a chip wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
