			<description>The annual watch and jewelery fair has opened its doors. On countless stalls outrageously expensive watches, precious gems and valuable jewelery are presented. A lot of money is involved. As you can already come into temptation. But a foray really worth? How good are your own maps? And what have before the others present? Because in addition to sophisticated thieves are also police officers, insurance agents and private spot. Given the many uninvolved visitors who do not think of a theft in a dream. But all want to score! Winning can in this turmoil just who succeeds at each of the six days of the fair to take on a new role and to keep the competition at bay. Billing is at the very end!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
