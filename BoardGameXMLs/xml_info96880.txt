			<description>This game is composed of eighteen wooden chips (pawns) in two colors (nine for each player) and a board with seventy-seven cells, of which eighteen are marked with two different colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player place his pawns in their respective colour cells and the game begins. Players move their pawns alternately one by one. The movement is one square forward or sideways, but never diagonally or backward. It&amp;rsquo;s forbidden not move a pawn in the player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player, after moving a pawn, trap a chip of the other player between two of his own, that chip is removed. Only one chip can be removed in each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when no piece can be moved forward, being all in the last cell. The player who gets the most pawns to the last row of the board, opposite to the area in which he started, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is part of the rare &amp;quot;Club series&amp;quot; from NAC, a company more known for his wargames than for this kind of abstract games. The other known titles from this series are: The Backbone, Manhattan and Daiquiri&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
