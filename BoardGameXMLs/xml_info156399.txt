			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 48 x 30 inch, Black and White Blueprint of a Bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Hex, Square and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey I ain&amp;rsquo;t asking you to break in and rob the place. All I want you to do is switch this note with one like it in the safe deposit boxes. Now how you do that is entirely up to you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bank is a hand-drawn, black and white, blueprint style map. The product includes the floor plan of the ground floor of a large bank. Each individual room in the house is labeled and includes hand-drawn objects signifying all of the furnishings of the room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bank is intended for use in modern games. It could also easily be used in near future science fiction games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Note: A middle-aged man contacts the Player Characters wanting to exchange a note in a safe deposit box in the local bank with the one in his possession. The man seems to know that they are freelancers or petty criminals with skills at deception, stealth, and theft. The note is in a sealed envelope with a wax seal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Player Characters decide to tamper with the note they find a forged will, which leaves all the possessions of his parents to the middle-aged man. Their combined assets are worth about 250K, paltry compared to the 2.5K offered to the group for the task. They could decide to refuse the job or go back and renegotiate with their employer. If they seem to let on that they know the scheme, the middle age man ups the ante to 25K, figuring that they might just be competent enough to pull this off. Of course, if they decline he now has no choice but to off them and look for some new employees. A man who has decided to kill his own parents after all has no moral qualms about killing people he just met.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Player Characters accept the job, it is up to them to figure out how to get into the safe deposit room and make the exchange. They could break in to the bank of night. They could also steal the safe deposit key from the man&amp;rsquo;s parents&amp;rsquo; house, disguise themselves to look like the parents, and just walk into the safe deposit room to make the exchange. They could also attempt to distract the security officer(s) on duty and disable the recording devices in the monitoring room, and then switch documents. If they think to read the document they switched out, the will gives most of the money to the man&amp;rsquo;s younger brother instead with a small amount to their employer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the deed done, the middle-aged man puts the hit on his parents. If he trusts the Player Characters after this job, he might even offer them the contract. The big thing is that it has to look like an accident of course...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
