							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">D4: Basic Quick Start</name>
									
			<description>introductory note:&lt;br/&gt;Below you&amp;rsquo;ll find a set of quick start rules and a small 1 player scenario for your enjoyment. We hope that you find as much amusement in trying to conquer this adventure as we enjoyed trying to find ways to slay your precious hero. Mwahaha!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although you&amp;rsquo;ll find everything you need to enjoy D4: Basic below there&amp;rsquo;s still a lot more to come and a lot more we plan to offer. The finished core rules will include a hefty list of monsters and their stats. We&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot of work to ensure that all D4: Basic monsters is a new and exciting experience. The core rules will also include 3 new full scenarios that supports up to 4 players (and the 4 new heroes needed). New fun and exciting treasure cards, a full accounting of the rules involved with playing the game, and of course all the wonderful and magical art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So sit back, relax, and get ready for a fun and deadly ride.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
