			<description>A family card game where players race to build certain layouts of cards. Each round, players draw a new Widget card which gives them a specific layout to build. They then take turns playing cards to their machine, trying to match the layout on their Widget card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game employs mechanics of both luck and tactical thinking, as players must play a card on their turn, meaning that poor planning can mean they are forced to make the game harder for themselves by adding a card in the wrong place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
