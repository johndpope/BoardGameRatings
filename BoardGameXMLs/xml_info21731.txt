							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Card Football</name>
									
			<description>This is a game that uses a regular deck of cards to simulate offensive play-calling in (American) football. Combinations of colors, suits and pips determine the amount of yardage gained, or lost, when they are drawn from the deck. (For instance, clubs often indicate a botched offensive play.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must choose whether to call a running, passing or kicking play before drawing the cards and this choice effects how the cards are interpreted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card Football was published in the book Card Games Around the World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
