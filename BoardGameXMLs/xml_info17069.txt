			<description>Can you make it as a BACKPACKER?  That's the challenge of a new adventure-filled board game that tells you if you&amp;rsquo;ve got what it takes to travel the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do the Visa Run, find your accommodation, and then hit the bar but keep an eye on your bag! Discover the must-do traveling experiences and the pitfalls to avoid, see the sights and survive the rickety public transport - all whilst racing across six continents with your mates. The first to travel the world in one piece wins the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just like the real thing, you have to travel on a tight budget - but don&amp;rsquo;t worry, there are plenty of opportunities to work and even phone home to bag some extra cash from Mum and Dad! You'll realize how quickly your money runs out, learn about the scams, the transport, the toilets... It's as close as you can get to the real thing without the food poisoning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by Marcus Lane, an experienced traveler, the game offers a backpacking insight that is difficult to grasp from books alone. Marcus says, &amp;ldquo;When I was knocking back a home-made rocket fuel in a remote Asian village one day I realized what a fascinating yet surreal world I was traveling in. I had read books that touched on some of the real issues of backpacking but nothing came close to telling me the full story. I decided to find another way to teach people what they were in for. It's as close to a trial run as there can be. You'll see how challenging yet fun the experience can be as you travel around the world meeting lots of new people and consuming all sorts of strange foods.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you make it as a BACKPACKER? is quite simply the fun way to learn how to plan a safe trip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great for gap year students, career break gappers or anyone who fancies a trip down memory lane. Contains a gameboard, 6 backpackers, 224 Visa Run cards, 156 Continent cards, a Foreign Embassy, a wedge of doofers (cash), a dice and rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No cockroaches included!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
