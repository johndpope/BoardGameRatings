			<description>An interesting UNO derivative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players start with seven cards. On each card is both a number from 1-26 and a letter from A-Z.&amp;quot; &amp;quot; Which card should you play and do you play it as the number or the letter? Win rounds by being the first player to get rid of all the cards in your hand. Score points by adding up the values of your opponents' remaining cards. Included is a custom card holder that forms two stacks of played cards - one for letters and one for numbers. The card holder's indicator designates the direction of each stack. Play a card from your hand - making sure it matches the direction of play.&amp;quot; If you can't play a card, draw one. There are also Bomb cards, which make the next player play 2 cards (play when you think they can't!) and every card has the possibility of being a wild card, based on the colors of the discard and matching a small 2 colored circle on each card. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interesting family card game with some tactical play possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
