			<description>Odyssey is a new game designed by Adam Kałuża, the creator of K2 and Cave. The game is based on a simple memo like mechanism although can be played in different variations. The board itself does not exist. It is created by the players by putting planets on the table thus creating a fascinating galaxy of pictoresque worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game components: &lt;br/&gt;4 rockets (each of a different colour) &lt;br/&gt;12 counters (four colours corresponding with the players) &lt;br/&gt;25 large planet tokens &lt;br/&gt;25 small planet tokens &lt;br/&gt;5 small black hole tokens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 25 beautiful large planet tokens which form the &amp;quot;elastic&amp;quot; board each time created by the players (it can be different every time they play). There are also at about 30 smaller planet tokens which represent the details from the bigger ones and black holes (25 + 5). Players create a square galaxy by putting the large tokens face up on the table in three variants: 3x3, 4x4 and 5x5. The smaller tokens are then shuffled and put in the same manner next to the galaxy (the number of items and their choice depends on the choice of the large tokens). Players may add a few black holes to provide a bit of player - player and player - game interaction. Players put their rockets (pawns) and a few counters of their colour on the edge planets (large, face up) which become their homes and the game is ready to begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To move the rocket a player has to flip the small tokens in order to find a planet which is adjacent to the one he/she is currently standing on. When this happens the player moves the space ship onto that planet and may take another turn. When a mistake is made another player starts his/her turn. Each small token has to be flipped back so that it stays face down all the time (like in a memo game). The goal is to visit all the edge planets and gather all kinds of counters available on them. The first player to do so is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is fully language independent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
