			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently on Kickstarter! &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://goo.gl/qeWoXd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://goo.gl/qeWoXd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Emergence Dark Dark Ops, players compete in a Battle Royale: free-for-all format against one another. Players are tasked to retrieve data to their home base to either upgrade abilities for future use or immediately score points and win. Each player is given a secret &amp;quot;target player.&amp;quot; Limit your target to the least amount of points, and score massive bonus points, enough to carry you to victory. But be aware that other players will be attempting to sabotage you as well. You won't win Emergence by keeping to yourself. Form soft alliances and timing your betrayal will allow you to gain an advantage, and control the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
