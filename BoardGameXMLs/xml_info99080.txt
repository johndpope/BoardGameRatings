							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">N a Row</name>
									
			<description>N a Row is a cousin to Captain's Mistress, which goes by the name Connect Four or Four in a Row commercially.  It is in the N-in-a-row family like Tic-Tac-Toe, GoMoku or Pente.  In addition to the working like Captain's Mistress in regards to piece placement, pieces are recycled and reused.  The combination of these elements leads to dramatic swings in potential outcome.  This game is an adoption of Pethera-Tethra (by the same author) for the boardgame Stonehenge to an 8x4 board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game part of Games on Half a Checkerboard Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
