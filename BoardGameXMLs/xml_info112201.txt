			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The laws of motion of the universe have been tampered with, and the world is in chaos. The only way to restore order is to find the word of peace and bring it to the Kinemator, who will be able to once again control the forces of the cosmos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kinetik is a side-view arcade-adventure game. The player must explore the 43 screens of the world, collect the letters of the word PAX in the correct order and bring them back to the Kinemator. Control of the player's craft is difficult at first, but items can be picked up that nullify some of the external factors, like gravity, inertia or friction. Other items include a defence shield or a chemical sprayer to defend against the many enemies. As each piece of equipment adds to the power consumption, the player must often recharge the craft's batteries by finding a pool of water and landing on it, or picking up flowers. Scattered across the levels are teleporters, which allow a player to quickly move from a screen to another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
