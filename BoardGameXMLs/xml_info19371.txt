							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crazy Talk</name>
									
			<description>Crazy Talk is a party game based on brief time-limited improvisations. A player randomly picks two cards: one with a character and one with an unrelated situation. The player then tries to act it out so that his/her teammates can guess what each of the two cards say. The character is either a fictional character, a historical character, or a real person depending on which board space the player landed on. The board consists of a single track with different colored spaces for the four type of characters (fictional, historical, occupation, or wild).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in Taboo, the player is not allowed to say any of the words on the cards. The player is allowed to say what the character might say in that situation, use synonyms, body language, descriptive clues, etc. The game requires a fair amount of creativity since the combinations are often quite bizarre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crazy Talk was a Games 100 winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
