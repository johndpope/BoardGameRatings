			<description>Book of Madhawapura tells about the story of Acaraki, a herbalist or an expert of concocting Jamu. Jamu is Javanese word which employs meaning of a mixture of natural herb ingredients that have been existed since centuries ago. In this game, players will act as the apprentice of Ra Tanca, the greatest Acaraki in Majapahit Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the apprentices of Ra Tanca, they had to race to collect the herb ingredients and concocted them into Jamu to cure the diseases suffered by people in five regions of Majapahit. Race to determine who&amp;rsquo;d deserve the coveted position of Ra Tanca as the next best Acaraki in Majapahit!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, the player has four actions to be done. Those actions are looking for ingredients (drawing a card), move from one village to another, cure a patient in the village, or using an Ajian. The goal of the game is to cure as many villagers as possible. And the game ends when one village has no sick villager.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
