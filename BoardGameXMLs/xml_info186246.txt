							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rebellious Archetypes Volume III</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be a Rebel with a Cause!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not every evil lurks in deep, dark dungeons far away from innocent townsfolk, waiting patiently for adventurers to kick down their doors and start fighting. Some monsters don't just prey on society from without, but have burrowed and wormed their way into the very heart of the civilized world, and twist and corrupt the very laws that are supposed to protect the innocent, using them to oppress and exploit them, instead. These evils are no less a threat than the ones that most adventurers face, but many PCs are ill-equipped to deal with them. This is a job for rebels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents five new rebellious archetypes for five different classes. Included are the society&amp;rsquo;s judge, an inquisitor archetype that focuses on clandestine investigation and mob fighting tactics, the mind criminal, a mesmerist archetype that implants rebellious thoughts in those around him and creates dangerous sleeper agents, the political assassin, a slayer archetype who makes political statements with her high-profile kills, the conjurer of riots, a summoner archetype that conjures aggressive&amp;mdash;and often explosive&amp;mdash;creatures, and the subversion specialist, a wizard archetype that specializes in casting spells unnoticed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're about to embark on a politically-themed campaign (such as the official Paizo adventure path focusing on revolution), or you just want a selection of exciting new abilities for passionate and freedom-loving PCs, this book has lots of tantalizing options to offer. Even GMs can get in on the fun, as several of the archetypes here are perfect for rebellious villains as well, and can make for exciting and memorable encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
