			<description>From the Publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A trade route through the great Deadwood Forest is being established; however all of the expedition teams have met with mishaps. Desert Ranger Smith, the great hunter that killed the Yogi, has been recruited to lead the next expedition through the Deadwood. Ranger Smith is recruiting adventurers, do you have the stuff that it takes to survive an expedition through the Deadwood? Nature of the Beast is an Exodus OPS campaign scenario for 4 to 6 characters of 1st to 3rd level and can easily be adapted to other post-apocalyptic settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario has been updated from the original to reflex the new Experience system used in the Exodus OPS campaign. OPS players that have already played this scenario, cannot re-play it, or gain any benefits from the changes within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
