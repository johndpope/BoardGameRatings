			<description>&amp;quot;Area Control game for 2-6 players. Early Earth Primitive Microbial Life Forms Compete for Territory.&amp;quot; Each player represents one of six different Microbial Kingdoms which have special attributes or abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a map composed of 64 Territories. Each space on the board has a set resource value from 0 to 5. The resource value governs the maximum number of Biomass Tokens that may occupy the Territory at the end of each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Game ends when all territories are filled up to their &lt;br/&gt;Max population levels.&amp;quot; Victory Points are then awarded based on factors such as the number of Territories a player controls and the number of Biomass Tokens each player has in play. The player with the most Victory Points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
