							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Goal Chance</name>
									
			<description>Goal Chance is a simple, quick-result soccer replay/simulation game which allows you to complete entire seasons very quickly and accurately with goal scorers and times of goals.  Gameplay consists of rolling the dice and referring to the player/team statistics on the team set cards and the game charts to determine which team won the match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal Chance can be used with the expansion team sets from the following of Terry Goodchild's other soccer games:&lt;br/&gt;Full Time, Soccer Replay or Final Score&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;although it is a much faster and simpler than those games, mostly used to get quick match results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It comes with a rulebook and some charts.  Two 6-sided and 1 10-sided dice are also needed to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be purchased alone or with Full Time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
