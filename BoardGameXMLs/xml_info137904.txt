							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dwimmermount (Labyrinth Lord)</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gates of Dwimmermount have opened. After years of rumors, it is time to discover the secrets of this vast mountain fortress for yourself...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dwimmermount is a classic megadungeon and old-school campaign setting presented for use with Labyrinth Lord and other d20-based fantasy role-playing games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 400-page Dwimmermount hardcover includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     13 mapped, keyed, and stocked dungeon levels containing a total of 715 fully-described and detailed encounter areas for players and their characters to discover - with random tables to generate even more!&lt;br/&gt;     86 monsters and 70 magic items to confound, challenge, and reward your players.&lt;br/&gt;     6 pre-generated adventuring parties to serve as rivals for your player characters.&lt;br/&gt;     A gazetteer of the lands surrounding Dwimmermount, both civilized and wilderness, in order to support sandbox play outside of the megadungeon.&lt;br/&gt;     An overview of Muntburg, a fortified town nestled in the shadows of Dwimmermount, intended to serve as a &amp;quot;home base&amp;quot; for the player characters between expeditions into the dungeon's depths.&lt;br/&gt;     A history of the dungeon from its earliest days to the present, with innovative mechanics that reward the characters for learning the secrets of the past.&lt;br/&gt;     Descriptions of numerous factions operating within and without the dungeon, whose activities add a further layer of complexity to Dwimmermount.&lt;br/&gt;     Discussions of ways to approach Dwimmermount, both as a player and as a referee, including insight into the dungeon's origins and design.&lt;br/&gt;     Over 40 different works by top artists including Jeff Dee, Mark Allen, Eric Quigely, Conor Nolan, John Larrey, Steve Zieser, Russ Nicholson, Kelvin Green, and the grand master of old-school fantasy, Erol Otus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Golden Age of fantasy roleplaying, the dungeon was the linchpin of adventure design and the sandbox was the assumed role of a campaign setting. With Dwimmermount, the Golden Age has returned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction (p. 13):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     All 13 levels of the Dwimmermount megadungeon, each consisting of many keyed locations stocked with monsters and treasure.&lt;br/&gt;     An overview of the lands surrounding Dwimmermount, both civilized and wilderness, in order to support play outside of the megadungeon.&lt;br/&gt;     The fortified town of Muntburg, located only a few miles from Dwimmermount. This is intended to serve as a &amp;quot;home base&amp;quot; for the player characters between expeditions into the dungeon's depths.&lt;br/&gt;     Descriptions of numerous factions operating within and without the dungeon, whose activities add a further layer of complexity to Dwimmermount.&lt;br/&gt;     A history of the dungeon from its earliest days to the present, so as to provide greater context for what goes on within its shadowy halls.&lt;br/&gt;     Dozens of new monsters and magic items for players and their characters to discover.&lt;br/&gt;     Discussions of ways to approach Dwimmermount, both as a player and as a referee, including insight into the dungeon's origins and design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book provides the referee with everything that he needs to begin a new campaign. Because of its size and complexity, Dwimmermount should provide enough material to keep players busy for many months, if not longer, as their characters grow in power sufficient to take on the most difficult challenges that lie in the deepest levels of the dungeon. Furthermore, the connections between Dwimmermount and the wider world, should the referee and players wish it, can expand their adventures to include everything from taming the wilderness and seeking magical secrets to playing politics&amp;mdash;and even to the exploration of other worlds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
