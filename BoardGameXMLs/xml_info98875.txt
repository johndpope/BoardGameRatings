			<description>Naruto: Ninja Council 2 (known as Naruto: Saikyō Ninja Daikesshu 2 in Japan) is an Action Video Game Released for Game Boy Advance and is the second installment in the Ninja Council series. It is based on the popular manga and anime series Naruto by Masashi Kishimoto and is developed by Aspect and published by D3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Naruto: Ninja Council 2 is side-scroller game in which the player has to advance through a 2D level while fighting enemy ninja. The levels vary from the original anime locals like Akagahara and the third exam stadium to some new settings like a cave system. The player is able to double-jump and teleport up and sideways to get to places that are normally out of reach. The game also features special levels in which the character's speed doubles and is asked to run through the whole level while collecting leaf symbols in a specific time. The playable characters are Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura, and it is also possible to unlock Rock Lee. The player is able to swap between characters using the left trigger, and each one has a separate life bar[5],however when a health package is picked up by one character, it affects the whole party. In certain points of the game however, the player is not able to switch between one or two of the characters, which results in a higher difficulty level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Naruto Ninja Council 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
