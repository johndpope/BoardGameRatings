							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Don&#039;t Split the Party</name>
									
			<description>(from the back of the book)&lt;br/&gt;United, they fell. Divided, they really manage to screw things up.&lt;br/&gt;The Order of The Stick: Don't split the Party picks up the story of those wildly popular two-dimensional heroes, the Order of the Stick, as they find themselves separated by war (which, it turns out is good for something after all).Trapped behind enemy lines, Haley and Belkar must escape the new goblin nation to rescue their leader, Roy, from a terrible fate: time spent with his father! Meanwhile, across the sea, Elan, Durkon, and Vaarsuvius have problems of their own as new foes target them with such tools of villany as deadly poison and direct mail marketing. Will our heroes be able to reunite the two halves of their team before the lich Xykon carries out his evil plan to conquer the world? Without their leader, will the Order find themselves unable to function at even their normal substandard level of efficiency? Find out in this, the fourth volume of the getting-sorta-epic The Order of the Stick adventure saga!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
