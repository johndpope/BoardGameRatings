Each of these battles bring the player's closer to the goal of capturing the king.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are available in the conlang Delang (both Delang script and Latin script), English and Norwegian. All game components are language neutral. No game components are supplied from publisher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Each pawn can move to an adjacent square, but only one pawn may move backwards. Use a way to mark such a pawn.&lt;br/&gt;     If a pawn has moved backward, no pawn can move backwards until a pawn has moved forward.&lt;br/&gt;     The pawn that has moved backwards cannot move until a pawn has moved forward.&lt;br/&gt;     If you do not have two swordmen more than your opponent, you may use your move to breed a new swordman.&lt;br/&gt;     Only the king can breed new swordmen.&lt;br/&gt;     The new swordman must be placed in an adjacing square to the king, and there has to be a swordman on the square already.&lt;br/&gt;     You have to move a newly breed swordman.&lt;br/&gt;     You have to kill an opponent's swordman that's in front of your's.&lt;br/&gt;     If an opponent's swordman is in front of a newly breed swordman, you have to kill that swordman with your newly breed swordman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
