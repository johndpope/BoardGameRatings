			<description>A quantum vortex is rearranging reality... history and fantasy are being jumbled together and somebody needs to untangle the mess! You must find the lost people and creatures then get them to follow you back to their homes. Lead enough followers to safety and you might just be able to destroy the vortex and rescue reality!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Follow is a tile/card matching game based on strategy and luck.&lt;br/&gt;Players create a different board each time by joining together the hex-tiles (111mm max. width) as the game progresses. Each hex shows a different location and in each location there is a 'follower' card (45x63mm).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The locations and characters are well known from history or fantasy but are randomly mixed. The objective is to lead these famous faces to their specific places. For example; you could find a bewildered Dracula in the Wild West and lead him through Ancient Egypt and Camelot to reach his Transylvanian home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules provide a choice of actions each turn, such as exploring new locations and stealing followers from other players as well as the opportunity to have several turns in a row, allowing players to plan strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The followers and locations are colour-coded as yellow, green, blue, purple and red. To win the game a player has to return one follower of each colour to the safety of their specific locations. Upon achieving this feat the player must then succeed a dice roll called the 'Gizmotron roll' in order to reset reality and therefore be declared as the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An eight page (A5) 'Instruction Manual' gives rules for 2 to 6 players aged 8 to adult. A standard game comprises 30 'follower' cards, 30 corresponding location hex-tiles, 6 'vortex' hex-tiles and lasts from 20 to 60 mins, depending on the number of players. The game is made quicker and easier by reducing the number of follower cards involved, along with their location hexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
