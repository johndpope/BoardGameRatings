							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The 18:25 to New London</name>
									
			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;The 18:25 to New London is set on a luxury train travelling from Glasgow to New London.  The journey takes 2 nights and 1 day.  All of the PCs and a number of the NPCs and connected though either their shared secrets of their interest in the occult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a scenario written for up to 6 players and one GM and uses the Unisystem as published in the Angel Roleplaying Game rules.  Access to that book is needed for play.  It is designed to be run in one session up to three hours long and is split into three acts, which each end with a body being found which has significance to one or more of the characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from Setting:&lt;br/&gt;The game is set 100 years into the future. After global warming has ravaged the world.  After years of war and abuse the Earth lashed out unleashing a fury of natural forces the likes of which had never been seen.&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the tide receded the world was a different place.  Countries re-built and some, like the former United Kingdom, h[e]arkened back to what was seen as their glory days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
