			<description>This educational milkcap game comes with milkcaps for each of the 50 states, marked on one side with various information about the state. Players take turns trying to flip as many milkcaps as possible. An opponent takes any flipped milkcaps and asks the player a trivia question from the front; if the player gets the question right he gets to keep the milkcap. Players continue taking turns until the milkcaps have been awarded, at which point the player with the most milkcaps wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
