			<description>Fun Places of the U.S.A. is a children's travel game in which players move on a map showing popular tourist attractions in all 50 US states. When a player stops in a state, he or she collects a souvenir marker. At the end of the game, the player with the most souvenir markers wins. There is no date of publication but based on the artwork and the tourist attractions shown on the map, it appears to be sometime in the mid to late 1960s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
