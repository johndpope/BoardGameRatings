			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         Note that all details for this game are preliminary. If you have information about this game, you are invited to edit this section or submit corrections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scorched Earth: Not Just a Bunch of Hot Air is a &amp;quot;board-less board game.&amp;quot;  The game board has been replaced by a color-changing dome, patterned to look like the Northern Hemisphere with a digital display floating in the Pacific Ocean. Players work to change the color of the globe from red to green by correctly answering questions about various environmental topics, learning which technologies are more &amp;ldquo;green&amp;rdquo; in order to invest in them and reacting to natural events. Beyond just teaching facts about the environment and global climate change, the game is set up to encourage thinking about how your actions affect the whole world and how what we do now will affect our future. Game-play also requires players to work together to improve the globe&amp;rsquo;s color, demonstrating how we must all work together to help slow the effects of global climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
