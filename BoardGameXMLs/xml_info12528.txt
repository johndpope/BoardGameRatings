			<description>Simultaneous plotted movement plus instantaneous travel to any system in the galaxy makes this a very wide-open game. Clean, simple rules for two players only. Solitaire suitability is zilch, and there are only counter sets for two players. Unfortunately poor production quality, especially the counters, detracts from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Counters are generic Warships, Transports, Planetary Defense, Infantry, and Bases. Rules for space battles, ground battles, transport, and production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, you must conquer 13 of the 25 systems in the galaxy, including four of the five major systems. Or, since this can be a long game, set a time limit and minimum systems required to win before you start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
