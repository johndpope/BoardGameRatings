							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stickman Base Jumper</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple tap the screen game, themed on Base Jumping. It uses a physics engine in much the same way as Angry Birds does. The game is arranged in a series of short levels each consisting of one jump, and each has its own challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A stickman figures starts standing on a building, you tap to walk away from the edge, tap again to start a run up, and tap again to open your chute.  On each level you aim to land in a particular place.  Some levels introduce wind, and additional buildings as obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
