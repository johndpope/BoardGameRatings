			<description>Each player controls one North American Indian Tribe.  Players use their people to gather food and to raid each other and the white men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Different types of tokens are used to undertake actions and record progress:&lt;br/&gt;-  Population Tokens (PT) are used to conduct actions such as raiding and hunting. Each Population Token represents about 50 People. &lt;br/&gt;-  Land Tokens (LT) are used to give access to food and resources. &lt;br/&gt;-  Food Tokens (FT) are used to feed your people.  They are gained by claiming certain cards. &lt;br/&gt;-  Horse Tokens (HT) give advantages to Raids.  &lt;br/&gt;-  Weapons Tokens(WT) give advantages to Raids. &lt;br/&gt;-  Spirit Tokens (ST) have a variety of uses. &lt;br/&gt;-  Trade Tokens (TT) represent things like furs and skins or crafted items that are used to trade with whites for things like weapons and horses. &lt;br/&gt;-  Craft Tokens (CT) represent an accumulation of skilled labour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common Spirit Card deck.  Cards are of 2 basic types: Resource Cards and Bonus Cards. &lt;br/&gt;-  Resource cards provide tokens and are then Discarded. &lt;br/&gt;-  Bonus Cards are placed face-up in front of the owner and provide either a continuous benefit or are discarded for a one-time benefit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game each player gets 10 PT, 10 LT and 10 ST. A player mater is utilised to track the status of the tribe and indicate how the PT are being utilised throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is conducted over six turns with each turn comprising 9 phases as follows: &lt;br/&gt;1. Season Phase&lt;br/&gt;-  Place 7 x no. of players cards from the top of the spirit deck face up. &lt;br/&gt;2. Braves Phase&lt;br/&gt;-  Players take turns activating Population Tokens one at a time.  An activated PT can hunt (claim a face up spirit card) or go on a raid or go trading. &lt;br/&gt;3. Hunt Phase&lt;br/&gt;-  Resolve Spirit Card purchases and conversions as soon as they are claimed.  Some Spirit Cards have a purchase cost in tokens. This must be paid immediately.  If the purchase cost cannot be paid, the card cannot be claimed.  If the Spirit Card is a resource card, immediately gain the indicated type of tokens and then discard the card. &lt;br/&gt;4. Territory Phase&lt;br/&gt;-  If you have more LT than PT, gain FT equal to the difference. &lt;br/&gt;-  If you have less LT than PT, lose FT equal to the difference.&lt;br/&gt;5. Food Phase&lt;br/&gt;-  Each player discards FT equal to their PT. &lt;br/&gt;-  If they are short then roll once on a Starvation Table for each FT they are short and resolve results. &lt;br/&gt;6. Raid Phase&lt;br/&gt;-  Players take turns conducting Raids. &lt;br/&gt;-  Each PT held in reserve conducts its own raid. &lt;br/&gt;-  When making a Raid, declare the target of the Raid: &lt;br/&gt;Target Opponent, Non-player Tribe, or White Men. &lt;br/&gt;-  Roll for results on the appropriate raid table and resolve accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;7. Trade Phase&lt;br/&gt;-  Players may trade Tokens with each other or with white men (using set conversion rates) &lt;br/&gt;8. Encroachment Phase&lt;br/&gt;-  Each player rolls once on an Encroachment Table and resolves results accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;9. Spirit Phase&lt;br/&gt;-  All unclaimed face-up Spirit Cards are discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over six turns. At the end of the 6th turn scoring is conducted as follows:&lt;br/&gt;Player with most LT gets 10 VP&lt;br/&gt;Player with most PT gets 9 VP&lt;br/&gt;Player with most HT gets 8 VP&lt;br/&gt;Player with most WT gets 7 VP&lt;br/&gt;Player with most ST gets 6 VP&lt;br/&gt;Player with most CT gets 5 VP&lt;br/&gt;Player with most TT gets 3 VP&lt;br/&gt;Player with most FT gets 2 VP&lt;br/&gt;Player with the most Bonus Cards get 4 VP&lt;br/&gt;If tied in a category, all tied players get the points -1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most Victory Points (VP) at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If at any point during the game a player loses all his Population Tokens or Land Tokens he automatically loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
