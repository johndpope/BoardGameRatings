			<description>Remember when you were young and you would look out the window on road trips and name off the out-of-state license plates that passed by? What about the different road signs? Scavenger has turned this travel activity into a travel game, perfect for your next road trip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scavenger travel games are compact travel tins with magnetic game pieces. Each magnet represents the images (either license plates or road signs) you need to find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives a travel tin. While traveling look for the license plates or road signs that you still need. Mark off your finds by moving the matching magnets over to the other side. The person who finds the most is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was designed for multiple players but works equally well as a solo game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
