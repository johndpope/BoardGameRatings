			<description>Another failed attempt by Waddingtons, to get into the electronic board game market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pitch has several holes in it at strategic points. If the ball rolls into one of your holes, you press a button behind the goal and the ball is 'pinged' out of the hole and into another hole. You hope to keep possession and eventually shoot into the opponent's goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It had sound effects and an electronic score board but, as a game, it is almost entirely devoid of skill. You just press buttons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
