			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In our product Hot Chicks 4.1: Ladies of the Night Naked and in Distress, you found 48 women of beauty and skill stripped to their most vulnerable and posed with expressions of terror on their lovely faces.  There, they were on 25mm Paper Miniatures.  Now, you can see the full-sized graphics in all their glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Hot Chicks Art Book 4.1: The Art of Ladies of the Night Naked and In Distress&amp;quot; includes all images used in Hot Chicks 4.1: Ladies of the Night Naked and in Distress, both front and back images.  Ideal for visual aids for the GM and even sketches of PCs having VERY bad days, these images give extra life and depth to the graphics from Hot Chicks 4: Ladies of the Night and the The Hot Chicks Art Book 4: The Art of Ladies of the Night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Hot Chicks Art Book 4.1: The Art of Ladies of the Night Naked and In Distress&amp;quot; is more than a collection of our full-sized graphics, though.  Included in this book are notes on using Prostitutes in your very own Horror Roleplaying experience.
