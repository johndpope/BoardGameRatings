			<description>This educational game consists of 100 cards:  twelve 1, 2, 3, 4, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division cards, two &amp;quot;double&amp;quot; cards, one &amp;quot;no addition&amp;quot; card and one &amp;quot;no multiplication&amp;quot; card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to obtain a total of 15 points by adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing the points on cards played in front of you, while trying to block other players from reaching 15 points.  Each player starts with a hand of 4 cards.  On their first turn, each player plays a single point card onto the table in front of themselves to form their pile, and then draws a card from the draw pile to maintain a hand size of 4 cards.  On subsequent turns, each player may take one of two actions:&lt;br/&gt;- Play 2 cards (an operation card (addition, subtraction, multiplication or division) and a point card) onto their pile or another player's pile, or &lt;br/&gt;- Discard one of the cards from his/her hand to the discard pile and draw a card from the draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A scorekeeper is appointed at the beginning of the game, and keeps track of each player's score as they play cards on each player's piles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach 15 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
