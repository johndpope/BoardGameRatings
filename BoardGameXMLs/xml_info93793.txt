							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Top Cat: The Santa Claws Scam</name>
									
			<description>A Christmas-themed Board Game for children, based on Hanna-Barbera's Top Cat TV series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It's Christmas, and Top Cat and the gang are on the look out for some easy money to buy the last prize hamper in the shop. Top Cat's plan is to dress up as Santa, and stand in front of shop entrances collecting money. After all, everybody would like to help a poor hungry kitty at Christmas time!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls a member of Top Cat's gang. Players start the game with 3 cards representing a Santa costume (Beard, Hat and Cloak), but can lose and gain these items of clothing as a consequence of various game events. To collect cash, a player must be in the possession of a full Santa outfit and end their turn on a money square (shop entrance).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Top Cat's nemesis - Officer Dibble - moves around the board after each player's turn. If Officer Dibble lands on a player, the player loses all of the cash that they're currently carrying. Cash can, however, be safely deposited in the player's home square (a trash can).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several event cards allow the players to attempt to &amp;quot;spoof&amp;quot; another player. &amp;quot;Spoofing&amp;quot; involves a bluffing/guessing game in which players have to guess how many coins the other player is concealing in his hands. The winner takes the loser's cash, and can also steal an item from the loser's Santa Costume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect 10 coins and purchase the prize hamper from the food shop wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
