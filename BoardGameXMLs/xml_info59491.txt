			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the seemingly peaceful city of Geanavue, mysterious conflicts begin to erupt, placing every citizen in great jeopardy. Only a brave and intrepid group of adventurers can hope to solve the problem, for treacherous information brokers, wealthy nobles, scheming clerics and dangerous creatures and minions all stand in the way. The city calls out for aid, but are you strong enough to face such a challenge? Step inside&amp;hellip; if you dare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 5th to 6th-level characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all Kenzer and Company products, this adventure was designed with the Dungeon Master in mind. We prepare all the details so you can spend less time flipping pages and more time gaming. Being a DM has never been so easy, or so much fun! Here&amp;rsquo;s some of what you get:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     48 pages of useful background, maps, artwork and adventure details; no useless fluff!&lt;br/&gt;     Over three dozen NPC profiles and statistics, including all of the major players and most of the minor ones.&lt;br/&gt;     Includes the new watchman variant class, a new magic item, details on the city-state of Geanavue, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All done in the quality you&amp;rsquo;ve come to expect from Kenzer and Company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although easily converted for use in any campaign setting, this book is designed for the Kingdoms of Kalamar Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons campaign setting &amp;ndash; a realistic, dynamic world where complex political alliances mix with marauding bands of humanoids, and medieval technology and culture come faces to face with magic and the fantastic. Whatever type of adventure you seek, you can find it here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To use this campaign supplement in a campaign, you also need a copy of the Player&amp;rsquo;s Handbook, the Dungeon Master&amp;rsquo;s Guide, and the Monster Manual. You can also find further detail on the Kingdoms of Kalamar campaign setting in the Kingdoms of Kalamar Campaign Setting Sourcebook, the Kingdoms of Kalamar Player&amp;rsquo;s Guide and the city supplement for Geanavue: the Stones of Peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
