			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kingmaker: The Reluctant Coronation is a turn-based, tile drafting, anti-set collection game where the goal is NOT to become king, but to instead be responsible for forcing another player to the throne. Being the leader of this cantankerous village is difficult work, best left to someone else. Still, the time has come for a new monarch to be crowned and as the wisest elders still around, one of you will surely become the new person in charge/scapegoat to blame for all the kingdom's problems. To decide who will ascend to this awesome responsibility, you'll present the accoutrements of power to your opponents hoping to ensnare one of them (ANY OF THEM!) with all five: the ring, the robe, the sceptre, the crown and the throne. Be careful! Each item given to another player also gives them a powerful advantage in a future turn. If they survive the round, revenge will come swift and hard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every round, each player presents one gift of power to another and then in turn, each player can assert the powers granted by their previously acquired artifacts. These powers can refuse gifts, trade them, introduce new ones or shuffle them around. When a player is bestowed the fifth item in the set and is unable to avoid accepting it, they become king and the player who gave them that item becomes the kingmaker and wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
