							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Marvel Slingers</name>
									
			<description>Marvel Slingers combines collectibles with toys in this dexterity game. The Marvel Universe provides the setting as heroes and villains (such as Hades, Loki and Athena) battle each other for supremacy at your hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic game consists of several elements. You have a battle map, a set of battle medallions, power boost medallions, and the central element - your Slinger. The Slinger is a ball-shaped yo-yo-like creation with a magnet on the under-belly; each Slinger has its own personality in terms of power and stamina, making different ones suitable for different levels of expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You use the Slinger to attack your opponents' battle medallions on the battle map, wielding the Slinger like a yo-yo. Your aim is to make contact with your chosen target and defeat it. The built-in power meter measures power, and a winner is determined. Each round is played as a 5-on-5 battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collectible aspect comes in the form of different Slingers and different medallions (both battle and power boost) &amp;ndash; all in various levels of rarity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
