			<description>Kippy Koo appears to be the forerunner of &amp;quot;Trouble&amp;quot; as it predates the children's classic by 9 years. The game is subtitled: &amp;quot;Indian Racing Game&amp;quot; and has a pasted on Native American theme in which the marbles represent braves having a race to determine which tribe is superior. The board layout and game play is similar to Trouble with a few exceptions. For example, instead of the Pop-o-matic die, you use 2 dice for movement. Since you need to roll a 6 to start a marble on the track, you can use a 6 on either die or the total of the two. Like backgammon, you can move 2 pieces by using the number on each die, or move 1 piece by using the total on both. If you roll doubles, you get to take an additional turn. Finally, in Kippy Koo, a marble need only cross the finish line to exit the board (no exact rolling is needed).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
