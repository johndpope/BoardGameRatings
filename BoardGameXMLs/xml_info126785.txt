			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scarrport: City of Secrets is a fantasy setting created by the fine folks over at Gun Metal Games (formerly Reality Deviant Publications) for the Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edition game system. A city of intrigue, adventure and mystery, it is a fantastic setting in which to indulge ones fantasy gaming desires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document has been written to convert the material presented in that supplement into the Mini Six system, and in the attempt bring some of the elements seen in 4e to this fast and cinematic system. This conversion is by no means prefect, especially in the light of the very different game mechanics seen in the two systems &amp;ndash; but it does work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It should also be noted that no setting material, nor content of the source book have been replicated here and the author encourages you to purchase your own copy of Scarrport: City of Secrets either in hardcopy or electronically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
