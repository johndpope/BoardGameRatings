							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Wars Gamer (Special Preview Issue - Nov 2000)</name>
									
			<description>This is a special preview issue of the Star Wars Gamer magazine. It was included as a supplement to the Invasion of Theed adventure game, and featured snippets from several forthcoming articles (descriptions taken from the magazine):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the Jedi Code (J.D. Wiker) - Many are taught the Jedi code, but few fully understand it. Fewer still live by it. Those who do are truly Jedi Masters. Full comprehension of the Code, then, is the key to unlocking the Force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duel of the Fates (Andy Collins) - The most dramatic and exciting scene of The Phantom Menace is undoubtedly the lightsaber duel between the Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the Sith Lord, Darth Maul. What follows is a break down of the final portion of that battle--the combat between Kenobi and Maul after Qui-Gon has fallen--into a round-by-round description of how it might have gone, had it been played using the Star Wars Roleplaying Game rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shipbuilding Secrets (Thomas M. Reid) - The Mystic Burn: Your transport to adventure. In a roleplaying campaign set in the Star Wars universe, the heroes are, sooner or later, going to need a ship of their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
