							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gothic Earth Eternal</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gothic Earth Eternal is a netbook project by Rucht Lilavivat and the Fraternity of Shadows. It is a Pathfinder 2012 update of Gothic Earth. What you hold before you represents the culmination of a year-long project. It is a continuation of the setting that was started in 1994 by William W. Connors and TSR. It was written and reviewed to some degree, though it does not bear the strong foundations of a work rigorously tested. That, we leave to you. We hope you enjoy what we have worked on. We hope that you use our material to craft your own games, your own stories, and  your own worlds. And if you do, tell us about them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;May all of your horror games end with a fright in your heart, a chill in your stomach and a prickling on your skin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good scares to all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
