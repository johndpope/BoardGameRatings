			<description>FIRE! FIRE! - Learn to Survive Board Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Children are probably some of the most vulnerable members of society when confronted by fire.  By playing this game they will learn how to prevent, avoid and survive a fire.  It is an ideal family game to help parents teach their children about the dangers of fire.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Devised by a professional firefighter of 37 Years experience with the Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service and with the help of Fire Prevention Officers part of the proceeds from the sale of this game goes to the Fire Service Benevolent Fund.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have two playing pieces each - one for movement on the board, the other to indicate progress up a &amp;quot;ladder&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a simple roll and move game with actions being dependent on where the playing piece lands on the board.  Options are:&lt;br/&gt;- Roll again&lt;br/&gt;- Move the other firefighter one rung up the &amp;quot;ladder&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;- Answer a question(from a pack of 132 cards on fire and fire safety). A correctly answered question will allow the 2nd firefighter to advance up the ladder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to get their first Firefighter to cross the board to his destination and return to the Fire Station (start) AND have their 2nd Firefighter climb the 12 rungs on his ladder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
