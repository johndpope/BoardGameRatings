			<description>Tic Auto is a racing game in which you start by setting the track with various usual objects, as well as a few wooden cubes and cones provided, and then move your car by flicking it on the table. Players also hold a hand of cards that can be played to gain advantages during the race (one more flick, teleportation...). If you don't suffer an accident, you switch up gears, which gives you more flicks on your turn (up to 3). The first player to cross the finish line wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
