			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hear Ye, Hear Ye&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kingdom of Blim, under the Not Too Bad Leadership of King Harold the Adequate, is no longer in need of Adventurers as the Kingdom has more than its fair share and has been satisfactorily protected from monsters of all sorts for quite some time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 80 percent of those listing their primary occupation as &amp;quot;Adventurer&amp;quot; reporting an average annual income of well below the poverty line, the Kingdom strongly recommends would-be Adventurers to instead seek employment in food services, blacksmithing, farming, or crafts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're not going to listen to that, are you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yeah, yeah. You've heard it all. Your parents tried to convince you to take over the family hog farm, your girlfriend begged you to take that job her uncle got you at the tailor's, but you were snagged by the seductive call of the Adventurer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You want the wealth, the fame, the wenches. You want to be the rock star that the elite 10 percent of the Adventurers in Blim are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, even though you've never so much as thrown a rock at a goblin, you've traded in your meager savings for some basic equipment, joined up in a party of like-minded fellows, and have officially opened for business. Now, only if there was someone who needed saving!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taverns &amp;amp; Drakes is a light-hearted riff on tradition fantasy poking fun at adventurer culture, classes, and fantasy races. It uses a simple system utilizing a single d20 for resolution with an emphasis on fast and fun play. Although intended to use for one-shot games, the setting and system are robust enough to handle long-term campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Comment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is available as a free download from 1km1kt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
