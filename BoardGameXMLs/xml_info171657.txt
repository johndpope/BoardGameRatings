							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mage Quest</name>
									
			<description>Long ago in Seven Cities of Gray, two adepts began quests to create libraries of spell books. They sent their allies out across the lands to gather rare elements and the mana needed to aid their growing hunger for power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mage Quest is a microgame for 2 players lasting about 30 to 45 minutes. The game is a prequel to Mage Clash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to create four Spell Books by collecting and trading Elements while moving across lands and seas with ships and caravans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, each player has two actions per turn with players alternate turns. Players may take any action in any order during their turn and may take the same action twice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Actions are:&lt;br/&gt;A. Build a new Ship&lt;br/&gt;B. Convert a Ship into a Caravan or Convert a Caravan into a Ship&lt;br/&gt;C. Move any or all Caravans or Ships&lt;br/&gt;D. Collect Elements&lt;br/&gt;E. Trade (within a City):&lt;br/&gt;1. Trade Elements for Elements &lt;br/&gt;2. Trade Elements for Mana&lt;br/&gt;3. Trade Mana for Allies&lt;br/&gt;4. Invoke Speed&lt;br/&gt;F. Create a Spell Book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
