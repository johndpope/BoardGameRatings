							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paranoid Fantasy</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paranoia is something I really strive to get from the players while DMing. When they&amp;rsquo;re paranoid, you know that their involvement in the game has passed from the purely abstract to a kind of belief in the drama that&amp;rsquo;s unfolding. Players are left a little unnerved or worried in a pleasantly omniscient sort of way. It&amp;rsquo;s similar to the experience of reading an especially effective piece of horror lit. They never approach the level of terror that could induce an actual panic attack. Not that I want to inflict that experience on anyone necessarily, but what if that degree of paranoia befell the character? What sort of bizarre behavior might result? And how would paranoia &amp;mdash; as a game element and system &amp;mdash; affect play overall?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
