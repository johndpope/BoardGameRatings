			<description>Two ways to practice how to translate written and digital time into analogue time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set Up: For inexperienced players, each take an animal piece and a matching player board with empty spaces face up. Each player places their piece on the matching spot on the woodland board. Spread the time tiles with the written and digital time face up. Put the big analogue clock within reach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play: Each player in turn rolls the die, moving the number of spaces clockwise around the track. If you land on a clock with a question mark, everyone calls out 'What's the time Mr. Wolf?', and you pick up a tile. Read the phrase and digital clock, then move the hands on the big analogue clock to represent what was read on the tile. Turn over the tile to the analogue image, if it matches the big clock, place the tile on one of your player board spaces. If the image and analogue clock does not match, return the tile back to the pile. In both cases it is the next players turn, going clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you land on the wolf picture, 'feed' one of your clock tiles on your player board to Mr. Wolf, if you have one. Again it will be the next players turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continue until one player has filled in their player board (if you run out of tiles to draw, return the tiles from behind Mr. Wolf).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second way to play if experienced is to play with only the player boards showing analogue clock faces. Set up is only making a stack with the tiles, again with the written and digital time face up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player in turn draws the top tile to see if it will match any of the analogue times showing on their board. Turn over the tile to see if they match, if so place it on the matching image on your board, if not return it with written and digital time face up. In both cases play passes to the left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continue until one player has filled in their board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
