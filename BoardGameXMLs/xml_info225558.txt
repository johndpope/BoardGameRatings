							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ortus Regni: Winchester</name>
									
			<description>2-4 player, Ortus Regni variantmap&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before London was the center of England, before Canterbury was the seat of the English Church&amp;hellip; Winchester was the capital of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Wessex and its cathedral was the resting place for many of the first English kings. This is not an era of great urban centers, indeed, but Winchester rises above the other Burhs and fortified towns of the shires. It is the center of both political games and literacy, and hosts much of the pageantry of the kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
