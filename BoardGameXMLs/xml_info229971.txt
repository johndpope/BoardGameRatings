							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Journey Begins: Well of Woe (Round 3)</name>
									
			<description>A Three-Round Adventure for 1st - 3rd Level Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final level of the dungeon is the lair of The Flame and his servants. The PCs may be surprised to find that The Flame is not a flame at all. Instead, The Flame is an immortal soul born over and over again in the form of a red dragon. The Flame&amp;rsquo;s current incarnation is a wyrmling red dragon. A kobold tribe, known as the Flamekeepers, carries out the age-old traditions of their ancestors in serving The Flame. While the main part of the tribe maintains their residence a short distance from the Well of Woe, those fortunate enough to be chosen to guard The Flame spend part of their time here. Only the bravest and most cunning are given the honor, and they rotate these duties with their time back at the tribe&amp;rsquo;s residence near the surface of Xen&amp;rsquo;drik.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
