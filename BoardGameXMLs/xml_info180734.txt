			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Have a Lot to Learn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS is one of the rare few RPGs that lets characters improve between adventures as well as from them. The challenge is in making study interesting &amp;ndash; perhaps even an adventure in itself. GURPS Social Engineering: Back to School is the ideal textbook for gamers who want to learn how.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drama geeks will like the advice on making school-based stories exciting. Nerds will appreciate the new rules for learning and teaching. Popular kids will enjoy the discussion of social success at school &amp;ndash; and how that translates to the community at large. Even jocks get a few words &amp;ndash; not many, and mostly small ones &amp;ndash; on body training and steroids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And for the teachers out there, here's a summary in bullet points:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Expanded rules for learning &amp;ndash; both slowly, through study and intensive training, and quickly, by spending earned points.&lt;br/&gt;- New character-improvement options like &amp;quot;converting&amp;quot; points between skills and attributes, and treating learning as a job.&lt;br/&gt;- Game mechanics for instruction quality, covering the effects of Teaching skill rolls, texts, training equipment, and more.&lt;br/&gt;- Details on how advantages, disadvantages, skills, and techniques (including several new ones) influence learning and teaching.&lt;br/&gt;- A look at social considerations such as student-teacher loyalty, finding teachers, and making academic Patrons and Rank useful.&lt;br/&gt;- Thoughts on running campaigns that use all this stuff, whether from the viewpoint of students, teachers, or school administrators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Read up . . . it'll all be on the test!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
