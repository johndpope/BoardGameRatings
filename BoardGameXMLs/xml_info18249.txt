			<description>From the designer's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wizards used to gather regularly to create new magic spells. But there was always a moron in the assembly to wreck the collective work. As a punishment he was given a Hairy Toad. The culprit was then really embarrassed cause this creature eats like 4 cows and has strictly no use for a Wizard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In spite of these light hitches, the gatherings were productive. Were invented there, among other things, this game and the famous spell Abracadabra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abrekodibru is a card game inspired from the traditional Cheat Game. Players are wizards trying to make up some new magic spells. The more players involved, the more the games are fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game for all ages, but remains strictly reserved to the uninitiated to the magic tricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card has a magic syllable from the famous one 'Abrakadabra'. Players use the cards to compose new incantations, following an order that must be respected otherwise the magic power of the spell is broken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time a player makes a mistake the incantation is set aside and the clumsy one is given a 'Hairy Toad' token. The goal is to finish the game with as little Toads as possible in your custody.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
