							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rise of Heroes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fully Compatible with the 5th Edition rules of the world's most popular RPG, Rise of Heroes takes a new spin on things.  This is an adventure designed for level 0 player characters, to take place after you've decided your background but before you choose a class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've all been there.  You've created your class you wanted to play without knowing what anyone else is playing, and a session or two into your game, you wished you went a different route.  Thus is the inspiration behind RISE OF HEROES.  With some house rules of starting and advancing as level 0 PCs, you get to experience the group dynamic before you get locked into a particular class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let there be no mistake, however.  This adventure is a full adventure, designed to be completed after 2-3 sessions, depending on how long you spend on each.  There are also a few options for the players to follow the main plotline, rather than get railroaded down one particular path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So if you want a true &amp;quot;zero to hero&amp;quot; adventure, wait no longer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
