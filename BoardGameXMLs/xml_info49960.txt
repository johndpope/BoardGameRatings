							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Songsmith</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure module for Chivalry &amp;amp; Sorcery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE SONGSMITH is an adventure pack for use with the Chivalry and Sorcery game system. It is intended for a group of four to eight players who control characters of various types and a gamemaster. This package also includes enough background to create an ongoing campaign based in the world of the North Kingdom, in which THE SONGSMITH takes place, as does the previous Chivalry and Sorcery adventure, THE DRAGON LORD. This adventure can be used as an isolated adventure or within an already existing campaign. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The setting is the more recently settled lands, north of the North Kingdom itself. Beginning in Barrisglen, where THE DRAGON LORD left off, the adventure takes the characters by sea to Dwarvendale in search of the long-lost city of the Dwarves, Khalezheer. Powerful help is available in this quest which requires knowledge of the hidden secrets of Khalezheer from the time-shrouded depths of the past. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Can the party reach Dwarvendale? Is the wizard Thuvalee all that he seems, and what dangers will be faced in the Lost City? It is a truly perilous quest, but the overall rewards make it worth all risks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
