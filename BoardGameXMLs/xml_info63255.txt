			<description>From Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OVER!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're a merc - you've been a merc for years. Now you've been offered a job that looks like a milk run. You're a little suspicious because the pay is good. Real good. So good that you take the job because you need the money, knowing all along that you'll regret this decision. But you've been between a rock and a hard place before. The problem is, nobody's been between ComStar and the Word of Blake before. No amount of money is worth that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Null Set is a roleplaying adventure for use with MechWarrior: The Battletech Role Playing Game. Set in the Battletech universe of the year 3054, the adventure sends mercenary player characters on a job that goes sour, and they must undertake a desperate quest for the truth that will save them from execution. The adventure includes information on the Mercenary Review and Bonding Commission and details about Harlech, the Wolf's Draggons' home city of Outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
