							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Farmers&#039; Market Rally</name>
									
			<description>Farmers&amp;rsquo; Market Rally is a set collection game of seasonal local produce and high scores and is for two to four people, aged eight and above. The game is set at your local farmers&amp;rsquo; market, where you&amp;rsquo;ve met up with some friends to search for items on your shopping list and collect anything else in season this week.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the number of players plus two, two rows of card stacks are dealt to create farmer's stands. Players take turns picking from the dealt stands, with new cards replaced after each turn. Two rounds of stands are available with surprises waiting to be found in the back of the second-row stands after players have made their most of their first-row purchases. The game continues until one of the second-row stands has sold-out, with one turn left for the remaining players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are thirteen item card types and 94 total items in the deck, plus ten shopping list cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
