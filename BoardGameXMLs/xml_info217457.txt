			<description>Who is the greatest special forces unit?  Take control of your elite 5 28mm operatives and go head to head against another 5 special forces team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First up is the U.K. SAS against the US Navy Seals. 28mm miniatures play on a 45&amp;quot; by 45&amp;quot; board map which can be made smaller and is included or play of a terrain table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each operative has their special skills and best suited fighting style. Command elite CQB units with their SMG and Shotguns. Head shot the enemy with your sniper. Suppress them with your machine gunner and blast them with your rifleman's grenade launcher. And don't forget, your unique Op. swap out or use your specialist depending on the team which could be a flame thrower or anti material sniper or perhaps at PDW etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More teams will become available like the Royal Marines Commandos, the Spetsnaz, the US Army Green Berets and many more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And don't forget the expansion, Zombies. Put your 5 members against a zombie infested town with various zombie types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feeling historical. Let go WW2 with your British Commandos, Waffen SS, Japanese Para Marines, the US Airborne, Russians and Chinese.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build a deck too and kit out your ops with various skills and equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes 3 cards and places them onto each Commandos dash board but keep them secret from the other players. Example of cards are tactics and equipment e.g. Kill box tactic, which means your unit will open fire on the first enemy unit to cross his line of sight. Kill box is used in the enemies turn meaning the enemy player has the risk of being shot at as he does not know if your unit as the kill box card.  Another example is grenades. Your unit could be carrying a smoke grenade and HE grenade on top of their standard equipment. A standard CQB operator for say comes with a SMG and shotgun plus a flash bang and grenade. So you could kit him up with extra grenades or medi packs etc with the extra equipment cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with a D12 (12 sided dice).  Each unit in the attackers turn has 5 actions each and the player uses them how he wants eg move, shot, reload, use rocket launcher etc. Some actions like rocket launcher cost 2 actions.  The defending player also get to use actions in their turn but only 3 and only if shot at or attacked.  Example if your shotgunner fires and hit or misses, the defender gets options. The defender can shot back, run, run and shot or charge. Each option has various negative and more negatives if your unit happened to be hit. Running for say means he can run to cover if in range as each member can only move 3-4-5 inches per action depending on their equipment load. If running then the attacker can choose to shot again but at -1 accuracy to the roll. The defender can use 1 action up to 3 action per defence turn. If he is attacked a 4th time then he can do nothing about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each unit has 10 wounds unless the have the skill Airborne which gives them 11 wounds. Face shots take off 2 wounds. Being hit in the arm twice will decrease accuracy. Legs 2 twice decreases movement. Having only 1 wound left means your unit can only crawl and lay.  Laying down or kneeing however increases your defence meaning the attacker has -1 or -2 to his accuracy when rolling to hit.  Medi packs increases wounds by 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reloading is required for every 3 shots and cost 1 action. Changing weapons like taking out a pistol cost 1 action unless you have the transition skill meaning it costs nothing to swap weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is highly tactical and there are various distances for weapons. Point blank. Close range. Short range. Medium. Long and extreme. Some weapons can not shot into long and extreme like shot guns etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Standard mission is kill the enemy team.&lt;br/&gt;Embassy siege is an Expansion which gives you 20 bad guys and hostages. Basically rescue the hostages. You can also play this as bank robbery too or town take over. Kill the bad guys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie is another Expansion. 3 missions. Your unit is trapped with minimal weapons and you can open crates found for better, extra weapons and escape. Or mission 2, storm the town and kill the zombies. There are various zombie types with different abilities and strengths. Or play the wave mission also.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
