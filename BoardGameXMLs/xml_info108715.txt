							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Windfall: Galaxy</name>
									
			<description>Windfall: Galaxy is a game of expansion and business on a galaxy wide scale.  Each player represents one of earth's major companies in the governing conglomerate.  They have to work together, using each other as a resource, to build and make better the structures they own to create a better future for everyone. But, when it comes to business, someone has to get ahead, and in the universe of Windfall, being the best means being the one with power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Windfall: Galaxy is a tableau building game where the goal is to get the most VP's from the central pool and build the best structures.  It's fast paced as player turns are just 1 action, and unlike other games, everything on the table can be used, not just by the player that controls it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Windfall: Galaxy takes trading to heart as one of the first things a player gets to do during his turn.  There are many reasons to trade: To get a resource you need, to make a card you own better, or to use something of someone elses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sector board gives players a chance to use other player's turns to their advantage.  By piggy backing of an action, they can use their structures in the same sector, to perform a small action like drawing cards or taking small amounts of VP's, before it even gets to their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
