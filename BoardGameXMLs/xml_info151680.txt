							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County</name>
									
			<description>Join in this crazy dash to hop your frog across the finish line, but don't let your opponent know which frog is yours. Hop. Bluff. Win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County takes place at a frog jumping contest. It relies on bluffing to make your frog finish first, bidding for turn order each round, and planning your next move. At the beginning of the game, each player draws a color card at random to determine which frog to get to the finish line. Cards are used for both bidding for who hops first and the type of action is performed. Actions include hopping one frogs, flipping over frogs, moving to the top of a frogpile and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
