			<description>A SHATTERED STONE&lt;br/&gt;A FRACTURED KINGDOM&lt;br/&gt;ONE LAST CHANCE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Being a chronicle of the darkest days of the land of Ereworn and of the band of heroes who ventured their lives upon three quests to reunite the shattered Crystal of Elvaron the Elf. Here are mysteries: insights to the ways of goblins; descriptions of the corruption of a Nobleman who unwisely pledged his soul to a foul servant of the abyss; knowledge of the fate of two great Wizards; a report of the foul beast at the heart of Skull Island; how to defeat demons; and advice on avoiding peasants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Elven Crystals is a four-part adventure set in the kingdom of Ereworn, a part of the world of Dragon Warriors that is under assault by the powers of darkness. The four quests are a combination of a chase through a haunted forest to free a kidnapped girl, exploring a cursed castle to track down its diabolical ruler, a coastal search for a wrecked ship and an underground cult, and a climactic battle against forces not of this world. The Elven Crystals is designed for characters of levels 1-2. It can be played by novice gamesmasters and players, but it has an engrossing story, memorable characters and exciting encounters that will entertain experienced gamers too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The classic 1980s text of The Elven Crystals has been updated and augmented by Adrian Bott - of Drow War fame - to produce a thrilling up-to-date fantasy mini-campaign. The four adventures can be played straight through, but there are natural break-points where new material can be added if the gamesmaster chooses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
