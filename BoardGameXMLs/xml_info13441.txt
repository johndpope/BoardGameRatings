			<description>This is a kids color-matching game that features Disney Characters. Each player takes a &amp;quot;train&amp;quot; and places it in front of them. The train is a vertical device that is used to drop passenger tokens into similar to dropping checkers in &amp;quot;Connect Four&amp;quot;. There are 3 lower color coded token &amp;quot;seats&amp;quot; and 3 upper seats directly above the lower ones. The passenger tokens, depicting various Disney characters and having various seat colors, are placed in a pile on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, all player take 2 tokens from the pile. The active player then spins the spinner. If Donald Duck is spun all players keep their tokens. If a number is spun then all players pass their tokens to the left the number of times shown on the spinner. Next players drop tokens that match their empty color seats into their trains returning any non-matches. A lower seat must be filled before you can stack a token into the upper seat. The first player to fill all their seats wins. For an advanced game, you must match both colors and the characters depicted on your train.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
