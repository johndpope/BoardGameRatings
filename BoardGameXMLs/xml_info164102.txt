			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sign was faded and the interior looked gloomy, but to Jacob St. Michael's Pub looked like home. He stepped through the door, shook the rain off of his coat and made a bee line for an open seat at the end of the bar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;What'll it be?&amp;quot; The young bartender said in a thick Irish brogue. &amp;quot;Jameson. Neat,&amp;quot; Jacob replied to which the bartender offered a satisfied smirk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Yer sittin' in me seat,&amp;quot; Jacob heard from behind him. He turned and saw a hulking man of about 6' 4&amp;quot; and about 250 pounds of muscle probably hardned from years on the docks or working freight uptown.His breath reaked of too much Guiness and cheap whiskey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob calmly turned back and downed the contents of the shot glass in one gulp as he felt the man's huge paw rest on his left shoulder. &amp;quot;Big mistake,&amp;quot; Jacob muttered with a smile as he spoke a word of power and let the energy begin to course through his muscles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where do you go when the action starts? To the battle map, of course! If you need a map of a modern structure, you need Modern Floorplans. The Modern Floorplans series from Fabled Environments offers gamers high quality maps in a variety of configurations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Want to draw it out yourself? Use the 8.5x11 map as a guide.&lt;br/&gt;     Want to simply drop the map on the table and play? Use either the full-scale map (if you have access to a plotter printer) or print the tiled version on regular paper and assemble a full-size version yourself in a matter of minutes. Both versions are scaled at 1 inch equals 5 feet.&lt;br/&gt;     In addition, each floorplan also comes in versions without room labels and without furniture.&lt;br/&gt;     This flooplan take advantage of both the Layers feature and the Tile Large Page function of Adobe Acrobat X&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: All floorplans are rendered in black and white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All maps are created by an architectural drafter using AutoCAD. This gives all of the maps the realistic feel that your players crave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a classic pub complete with a single pool table and booths along the walls. Whether it is the 1930's or 2030's, this small bar is pefect when you need a meeting place or simply a location for folks to kick back and relax.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
