							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Razor&#039;s Edge</name>
									
			<description>The Razor's Edge is a new fast paced game of man-to-man combat set during WWII in 1944-5. Each player controls a squad of up to 12 soldiers and can play in many different scenarios and combat situations. Each counter represents a single man, each hex 2-3 meters, and each turn 10-30 seconds. Games take from 45 minutes to a couple of hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Razor's Edge is entirely free and open source. Players may use the rules, components, and artwork to create their own scenarios, nationalities, new units, or entirely new games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenarios include patrols, night actions, partisan raids, rescuing downed airmen and many more. In each scenario the actual soldiers used are randomly selected, so whether you end up with outstanding soldiers or the less than first rate soldiers, you will need to marshal your squad and use their abilities to the best you can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nationalities included in The Razor's Edge are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    British, steady under fire, but sometimes hidebound by their training methods&lt;br/&gt;    American GIs, always full of individual initiative, but sometimes not with the best fire discipline. &lt;br/&gt;    The Germans are really a mixed bag by mid-1944, there are some very seasoned soldiers along with many that are very inexperienced.&lt;br/&gt;    The French Resistance, the men and women of the Resistance may not always be the best prepared but they try to always take on the Germans when they have a clear advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
