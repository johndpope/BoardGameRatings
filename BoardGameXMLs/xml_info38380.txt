			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;Can you correctly identify a candy by taste?  An onion by smell?  An egg by feel?  Too easy?  Try identifying the sound of a person walking without shoes by hearing?  Estimate within one inch the height of someone by sight?  Or guess the content of a picture by ESP?  Wait until you try the Wild Cards, which give you a chance to invent your own challenge to stump your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to collect points to advance to the 'Finish' block on the game board. Points are collected by correctly identifying objects using the senses if sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell and the 'sixth' sense, ESP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
