			<description>Iron &amp;amp; Brass: Duel is a 2 player, 9 card &amp;quot;nano-game&amp;quot; originally created for the 2016 9 card nano game contest.  The game is an infantry skirmish card game.  Each round of the game is a 3 vs 3 infantry encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will have 6 soldiers - 1 on each side of the 3 cards. These soldiers are labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F for clarity. Each soldier (card face) is also named alphabetically to give it more of a human touch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each soldier card has 2 actions per side, for a total of 12 actions per player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All battle resolutions are: &lt;br/&gt;1) Determine # of dice to roll: Attacker's dice +/- Defender's modifiers&lt;br/&gt;2)Roll the determined number of dice, 1 or more &amp;quot;6&amp;quot; = opponent card side (not the entire card) is defeated. So, in effect, the game will play as if each player has 6 1-sided soldier cards, but in reality, each will have 3 2-sided soldier cards. Hope that makes sense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game challenges each player to decide which soldier actions to play, where to play them, and when to attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
