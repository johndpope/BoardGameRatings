							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Pieces of Flotsam and Jetsam To Find On A Beach (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Should characters be beside a body of water at some point, especially large ones such as seas and oceans, they may stumble across various bits of debris and other items that could be found on a beach, whether rocky or otherwise. These could be lost or discarded from ships or simply usually found in such locations. This list has 100 different such items, from scene dressing to useful to valuable to potential adventure hooks to potentially dangerous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A footlocker. Inside are two sets of wet sailor&amp;rsquo;s clothes, a ruined book, a tarnished silver ring worth 3 sp, and a broken storm lantern. Carved into the locker is the name Adolphus, and a DC 20 Knowledge (Local) check reveals that was the name of a merchant ship that went down in a storm around these parts ten years ago. The legend says the captain was smuggling something valuable on the ship, and he drowned trying to get it out of its hiding place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the front cover, one the front matter, one the Open Game License and around half a page is the introduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement is also available in a system neutral version. The latter is a bit shorter and doesn't have the Pathfinder stats for some items. You do not need to buy both versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
