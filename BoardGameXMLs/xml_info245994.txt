			<description>The Dead Eye is a solo survival adventure card game set in a cosmic post-apocalyptic world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The single player assumes the role of the Pilgrim, battling across an inhospitable world, salvaging items, to reach ever further to the heart of a toxic planetary storm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play involves drawing cards from a a single deck. &lt;br/&gt;The player must either choose to face the Encounter shown on the card ( if not already facing an Encounter ) or place the card in a Good or Bad icon stack on either side of the Encounter card slot.&lt;br/&gt;When the number of icons in a stack match the Good or Bad trigger shown on the current Encounter, the card is resolved, and either discarded or acquired by the player as an Item or Destination.&lt;br/&gt;When the draw deck is depleted, the discard pile is shuffled to form a new draw deck.&lt;br/&gt;The player begins with 5 Lyf and 5 Def cards. Should a card effect require that either of these cards be added to the discard pile and the player is unable to do so, the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;The player then calculates their furthest distance by adding up all points shown on their Destination cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
