			<description>&amp;quot;You command a task force of galactic troopers against enemy forces on distant planet. Your Planetary Infantry, supported by Space tanks and all-atmosphere personnel carriers, take on the opposition on desolate asteroids, bizarre planets and far-off space stations. Your troops are armed with the latest particle bean cannons, ray guns and zap rifles in their quest to make the Universe safe for Humanity.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A simple, fun game for kids of all ages. Play it on the beach, in the backyard or the living room rug!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three battle scenarios are presented: an open field battle with two forces facing off across No Man's Land, an assault on a defended position, and a battle in which each side is attempting to capture and hold an objective on the opponent's side of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units are rated for movement, attack range, and damage (at close, medium, and long range). Range and damage ratings vary based on whether the battle is located in a vacuum (&amp;quot;Space Atmosphere&amp;quot;) or in a &amp;quot;Half-Earth&amp;quot; setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules also cover missiles, grenades, terrain effects, defensive armor, air supply and robots (divided into seven types). Advanced rules add spacecraft, planetary facilities, communications, and leadership. The advanced rules also prsent more distinctions between vehicles (wheeled, tracked, hovercraft, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the Sandy Hook Battle Games, available for free online at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.thortrains.net/armymen/spacegme.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.thortrains.net/armymen/spacegme.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
