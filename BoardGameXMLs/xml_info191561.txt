			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you: Dedicated to victory no matter the cost?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you: A terran patriot?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have nerves of steel?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have then perhaps you can be a successful Drop Commando and help Earth in it's battle against the enemy Aliens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Sector 90 the player takes the role of a Drop Commando sent to open a chink in the defences of the Toor-Tamin, who have been at war with Earth for 200 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drop Commandos are dropped in to enemy areas using powerful teleporters. These are powerful enough to punch through strong defences, but can only send one Commando at a time, are one way only, and cannot hit their destination with precision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Drop Commando must therefore search for the centre of the Sector 90 &amp;quot;Sector Intelligence Unit&amp;quot;. To do so he must fight his way from where he is teleported in, and make his way through various locked doors where puzzles need to be solved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the centre, he must plant a bomb then escape within a 90 second time limit. If he succeeds, a gap will be opened in the Toor-Tamin defences, allowing the Terran fleet to break through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
