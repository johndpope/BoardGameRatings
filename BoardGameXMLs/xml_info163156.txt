			<description>The game starts (space 1) and ends (space 149) in Greenland. The first player to return there from his journey around the world, winns the game. &lt;br/&gt;Movement is determined by two dice. On odd doublets the player advances to the next city, on even doublets he has to go back to the last city he passed or visited. When a player gets to a city, he has to tell it's name. If he can do that, he may roll again, if not he has to pass a turn. On the blue spaces (sea) only even eyes count.&lt;br/&gt;From space 129 onward, only one die is used. If a player gets on a space which is occupied by another player, the other player has to go back to the last city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
