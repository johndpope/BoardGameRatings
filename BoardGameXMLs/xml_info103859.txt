							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Touch of Madness</name>
									
			<description>Touch of Madness cards are for LARPs (or RPGs) that involve sanity. Instead of the storyteller just informing players that they've lost some sanity, hand them a card with a specific symptom for them to act out instead. Touch of Madness cards come in three levels, Green (Mild), Yellow (Moderate), and Red (Severe) cards. The cards are easily adapted to any LARP that involves sanity, and instructions are included with various ways to implement them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
