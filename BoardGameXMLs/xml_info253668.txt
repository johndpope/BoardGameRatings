			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We Used To Be Friends is a collaborative teenage detective drama game. As a group, you&amp;rsquo;ll create your teenagers, the city they live in, and a season-long mystery that ties them all together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We Used To Be Friends involves a series of interwoven mysteries. You&amp;rsquo;ll have your season mystery, every character has their own personal mystery, and each session has its own episode mystery. Since the game is collaborative, you&amp;rsquo;ll investigate locations to find clues and then apply those clues to the various mysteries, moving them along as you discover what happens together. No one needs to plan it out before you play. You can pick up the game and immediately begin to figure out who did it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the mysteries are going on, the characters still live their lives. They have friends, enemies, acquaintances who are all around them. They open up to each other, they fight over their feelings, and get into trouble while figuring out what happened. Part of the essential conflict and drama of We Used to be Friends is balancing the tension of the mysteries with the reality that these characters all have to live in the same town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
