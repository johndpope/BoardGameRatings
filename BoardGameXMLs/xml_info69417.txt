			<description>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, known in Japan as Zeruda no Densetsu: Kamigami No Toraifōsu (ゼルダの伝説 神々のトライフォース, lit. &amp;quot;The Legend of Zelda: Triforce of the Gods&amp;quot;), is an action-adventure video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game console, and the third installment in The Legend of Zelda series. It was first released in Japan in 1991, and was later released in North America and Europe in 1992. Shigeru Miyamoto and his team were solely responsible for this game's development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Link to the Past's plot focuses on Link as he travels on a journey to save Hyrule, defeat Ganon and rescue the seven descendants of the Sages. A Link to the Past uses a top-down perspective similar to that of the original The Legend of Zelda. It added mechanics and concepts to the series that have become commonplace, including multi-level dungeons and new equipment (such as the hookshot and the Pegasus Boots), as well as establishing the concept of an alternate, parallel (and sometimes far more dangerous) world. It was well-received since its release, and has been listed by GameSpot as one of the best installments of the series, as well as one of the greatest games of all time. To date, A Link to the Past has sold more than four million copies, and has been re-released for the Game Boy Advance and the Wii's Virtual Console. The GBA remake was released together with the other Zelda game The 4 swords.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The_Legend_of_Zelda:_A_Link_to_the_Past,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits:&lt;br/&gt;Koji Kondo: Music&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
