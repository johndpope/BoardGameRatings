							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Devolved Psychics</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before stagnation set in, the Terran government worked for centuries, trying to find technological solutions to the problems its interstellar empire posed. Many wondrous things came out of those Terran labs, and many terrors, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside the labs examining devolution, normal humans were transformed into apes, lizards, fish, and amoebas. They could never translate these results into an offensive weapon, but it was used several times to punish people that offended someone both important and corrupt. Eventually, this was the only reason the program continued to receive funding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But lead scientist Dylan Martinez never gave up. He saw the potential in this project, and how it mirrored his favourite movie, David Lynch&amp;rsquo;s Dune. He wanted to make worm-like navigators out of these test subjects, but the results were something different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These devolved psychics cared little for serving human society in any capacity, let alone as glorified taxi drivers. They wanted humans to serve them &amp;mdash; and those that remain still do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
