							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Drums in the Marsh</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the past several nights, drums have been heard on the wind, coming from the Twilight Marsh. Each morning, more turn up missing from the nearby farms, leaving only muddy, clawed footprints heading toward the marsh. Can you help find the lost and bring justice to the abductors? And adventure for 1st-4th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is designed for three to seven 1st-4th level characters, and is optimized for five 3rd level characters. Characters outside this level range cannot participate in this adventure. Players with ineligble characters can create a new 1st-level character or use a pregenerated character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure occurs along the Trank River and within the Twilight Marsh. Both are located east of the city Phlan on the north shore of the Moonsea in Faer &amp;ucirc;n.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
