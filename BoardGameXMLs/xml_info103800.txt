			<description>Wendy's kid's meal promotional version of boggle. Uses a set of cards with &amp;quot;magic window&amp;quot; protection for the letters and a red plastic screen to reveal the letters when the game is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in regular boggle a player (or team) find as many connected words as possible from the face up letters resting in a 5 x 5 grid. Words can be formed by letters connected left, right, up, down or on diagonals. Each side has 1 minute to find a word of at least 3 letters, and then play passes to the other side. Whomever can't find a word after 1 minute is the loser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
