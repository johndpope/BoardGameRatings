			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guilds are brotherhoods of craftsmen who have banded together to control economic activity in specific or related trades. Throughout H&amp;acirc;rn and western Lythia, virtually all significant commercial and professional activities are within the control of powerful international guilds whose monopolistic rights are protected by law. This article outlines the structure of a typical H&amp;acirc;rnic or Lythian guild and describes each of the individual guilded occupations. Guild badges are also shown. This article was originally published in 1988 as part of issues 7 and 8 of H&amp;acirc;rnlore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
