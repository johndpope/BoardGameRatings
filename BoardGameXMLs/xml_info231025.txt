			<description>A game of story telling for 2 or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck of cards - each giving a location, character, theme, item or event.  Each player draws 5 cards (or 7 for a longer game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player starts to tell a story. Players try to incorporate the idea on one of their cards into the story. If a player does this he may discard that card. After discarding, the player to his right continues the story, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story ends when the last player discards his last card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player manages to say something very witty, or clever, or profound, or poetic, or funny, or memorable, the other players may award him one or more story points.Players may deduct Story points for poor performances.  A player may at any time deduct a story point to discard a card &amp;amp; draw a new one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the story, the player with the most Story points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
