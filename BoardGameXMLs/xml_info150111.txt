			<description>Excerpt from the RPG:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's all but over for humanity. A massive invasion has left the world in ruins with a scant few people desperately fighting back, most likely with no chance of success. You are the leader of a small group of resistance fighters, one of the few survivors who have chosen to not just hide and wait for the inevitable but to strike back against a foe that seems impossible to defeat. This is your story. This is a game of choices, values and introspection. You will play alone by imagining yourself placed in situations where you are forced to make decisions that affect the lives of your fellow fighters, and perhaps the fate of all of humanity. The key to enjoying this game is to do just that: imagine. Put yourself in the situation the game introduces and consider your emotions, your own thoughts, what your options are, and then choose. Commit to the choice, and when the consequences come accept them, contemplate them, and try to decide if what you gained was worth what you lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
