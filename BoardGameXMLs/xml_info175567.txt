							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Triba Nation</name>
									
			<description>Triba Nation is a turn based card game where each player is required to construct a total of five buildings, with the palace as the final building. The first player who builds the palace is recognised as the king and wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start the game with 3 Tribesmen cards. A shared Building Option line of 4 Building cards and a Palace card is setup in the middle of the play area. &lt;br/&gt;Each round then consists 4 phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Phase 1 (Draw) - The player draws 2 Tribesmen cards.&lt;br/&gt;    Phase 2 (Tribesmen) - The player gets to play Tribesmen cards. A max of 5 Tribesmen can be in the player's area. Players can also swap out Tribesmen during this phase (discarding the one they replaced). Tribesmen are required to build buildings and also activate Attack/Magic cards.&lt;br/&gt;    Phase 3 (Construction) - Players can build one Building from the Building Option line if their Tribesmen colors match the Building's requirements. Building special abilities also take place during this phase.&lt;br/&gt;    Phase 4 (Action) - Players can play any Attack or Magic cards in hand if they have more Warrior(Attack) or Shaman(Magic) cards than their target. These allow the player to destroy, steal from  and generally muck with the targeted opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the 4th phase, the player trims his hand down to 5 cards and play continues with the next player. The players try to build 4 building and 1 palace (which must be built last). The first player to build the palace wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
