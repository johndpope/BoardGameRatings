			<description>This Depression-era party game is really a gambling game, but green wooden disks are provided as a game currency. The board has a central pot with a buff corridor from each of the four sides. In between are three concentric octagonal rings (Green outer, Grey middle, Orange inner). On these rings are spaces with 8 Up elevators, 8 Down elevators and 16 black circles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 16 numbered wooden tokens and matching cardboard disks. Each player takes one of the tokens randomly from the cup and keeps it secret. The cardboard disks are distributed randomly onto the black circles on the board. The goal of the game is to land on and &amp;quot;collect&amp;quot; one's own disk number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player antes one chip and moves onto the board via one of four Entrance Elevators. Players roll a red and a white die and may choose which to use (red goes left, white goes right). Elevators, dots and the buff corridors must be reached by exact throw. In a buff corridor, a player immediately tries to reach the pot by exact count (1,2 or 3 depending on ring); if successful, he collects the pot, and everyone antes again. In either case goes back outside the building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player lands on and captures a numbered disk other than his own, the owner (if in play)must say &amp;quot;That's Me&amp;quot; and pay his captor five chips. Landing on another player &amp;quot;bumps&amp;quot; them and requires a fine of one chip to the pot and another to the bumper. The winner is the first to land on and collect his own numbered disk. The winner collects the pot plus 10 chips from each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
