			<description>A One-Round Living Greyhawk Duchy of Urnst Regional Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Duchy of Urnst has always maintained a series of fortresses within the Abbor-Alz Hills as a means to protect and guard against the Empire of the Bright Lands to the south and the treacherous plots of Rary. Now in a matter of one year two of the three primary fortresses have fallen, and rumor holds that the last of the three, Nil Keep, is soon to be destroyed as well. The Ducal Guard, who maintains the fortresses, is worried that these rumors are true, and to that end they are hiring adventurers to investigate these rumors and determine their veracity. The Abbor-Alz are a wild and dangerous place, are you willing to enter them and determine if there is indeed a concerted threat to the Duchy, of if the rumors of the third castle being destroyed are simply rumors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for characters from [levels] 2 through 12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is a Ducal Guard adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
