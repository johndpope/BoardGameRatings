							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Swedish Bikini Assassin Team</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In 2012, several female corporate operatives were convicted of crimes that they may or may not have committed. They eventually escaped from a minimum security facility near Stockholm and hid in the Swedish underground, from where they operate as killers for hire. If you need someone killed, if you like hot Swedish chicks, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the Swedish Bikini Assassin Team.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a supplement for Hot Chicks: The Roleplaying Game - you will need the core rulebook to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here you will find three of the deadlist women Sweden has yet produced, who have joined forces for the sheer joy of killing and making money off of it. With their mysterous benefactor, they can be enemies, or allies, or even very, very complicated love interests. Don't say you haven't been warned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes three fully realized characters suitable for use as NPCs or advanced Player Characters, background story, and bonus illustrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what are you waiting for? Come on in, the water's fine!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
