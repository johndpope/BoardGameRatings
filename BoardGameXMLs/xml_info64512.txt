							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Poker-Reno Game</name>
									
			<description>A poker dice game...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a variation of Yahtzee, using poker dice. Instead of 1-6 at the top of the score sheet, this game has Aces, Jacks, Queens, Kings, Nines and Tens. Scores are recorded the same way as in Yahtzee, following the 1st, 2nd or 3rd roll, in the order shown above, scoring is 1 each, 2, 3, 4, 9 &amp;amp; 10. A bonus of 44 is scored if the total in the section above is at least 87 (an average of 3 dice each category.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the bottom scoring section, Poker-Reno is similar to Yahtzee, but scores 60 points. Fortune works the same way as Chance. 2 Pair of Same Color, and 3 of a Kind score the total of all dice, Full House scores the total of all dice + 45, and Straight (5 consecutive) scores 50.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instructions state that any amount of players may play the game, but the score sheet is designed for no more than 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
