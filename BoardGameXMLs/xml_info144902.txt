			<description>Over a century ago, the lizardfolk tribes of the Great Swamp were united by a warlord with megalomaniacal ambition. His name is lost: he was known only as the Lizard King. He whipped the lizardfolk into a frenzy and drove them to rampage across the region, slaughtering those who fought back and enslaving those who surrendered. The region's leader, the Count d&amp;rsquo;Orlon, fell in battle and all seemed to be lost. Finally, near the sleepy village of Northamlet, the count's teenage daughter, Just&amp;icirc;ne d&amp;rsquo;Orlon, slew the Lizard King in bloody combat. The horde scattered and the horror and slaughter were over forever. Or so everyone thought...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trouble in Northamlet is an adventure front for the Dungeon World RPG. It presents the skeleton of a complete original adventure, inspired by a classic old-school TSR module from the 1980s. With it and a minimal amount of prep work, a GM has enough material for several sessions of play, as well as the set-up for a longer campaign arc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
