							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Disgruntled Decks: Marine Corps Edition</name>
									
			<description>Disgruntled Decks is a card game for military service members and grizzled Veterans who enjoy laughing together about their time in the service. With a unique blend of descriptive language and military themes, Disgruntled Decks gives one more reason for service members and Veterans to talk about their shared experiences while having fun in the process.&lt;br/&gt;Our message is simple: Humor through healing, and some Veterans still have a good amount of healing left to do. We hope to provide some of that humor with Disgruntled Decks. First to 7 cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Cards Against Humanity style game targeted at veterans and members of the military.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
