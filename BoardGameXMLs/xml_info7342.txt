			<description>[from the rules intro...]&lt;br/&gt;This fascinating game, which combines features of a centuries old Chinese game with modern ideas, provides keen entertainment and the exercise of considerable skill.  It is fast, sporty, and not complicated.  Standard equipment: 52 tiles, 2 racks, 1 set of rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a lavishly packaged Gin Rummy. The only difference is that there is a bonus for a hand of entirely one suit (10 points) and for a hand that is one continuous sequence (20 points).  The cards are replaced by tiles with suits of lanterns, junks, bamboo and daggers, and the court cards are called Jong, Quong and Kong!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in Melbourne, Australia in the 1940's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
