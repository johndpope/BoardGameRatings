			<description>&amp;quot;Steel and Crystal is an easy solo game of conquest on a fantasy land. You are the General of your Empire and your mission is simple: defeat the enemies of your Emperor. Every scenario states the initial forces that you have under your command and the objectives you must obtain to win.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Scenario #1: the Aidlon offensive. After 5 years of relative peace the Xytyan empire has newly started a series of offensive maneuver against the neighborhood kingdoms: the Isle of Aidlon is now menaced so you've been assigned to the defensive campaign . . . You win the game if you control the city-fortress of Hishimur (area 24) at the end of any turn.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was part of the Microgame Design Contest 2002.  The file in the link section contains this and several other games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
