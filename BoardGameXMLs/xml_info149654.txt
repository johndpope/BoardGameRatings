							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Godling Tech: Volume 1</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The godlings. Thousands of years ago the universe was their playground. Their technology is a mystery (some would say magical). They are gone, but their toys and their tools and their terrors remain. Waiting to grant riches. Or death. Will you seek for them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Godling Tech is a Stellar Wind supplement that provides 23 pieces of godling technology GMs can introduce into their universe. The book also includes a history of the godlings and guidelines on how GMs can introduce godling artifacts into their game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
