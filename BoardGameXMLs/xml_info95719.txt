			<description>Play the Stock Market and you could earn your fortune!&lt;br/&gt;With each throw of the dice you can buy and sell shares, collect dividends and attend stockholder meetings with stock splits. The winner is the first person to reach the &amp;ldquo;Winning Net Worth&amp;rdquo;. Several game rules are customizable allowing you to adjust the behaviour of the game and extend or shorten the length of a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stock prices go up or down with each move depending on the square you land on. Remember to buy low, sell high and attend as many stockholder meetings as possible and you could earn your fortune playing the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play against three difficulty levels of AI, other (local) humans or any combination of the two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Custom board layouts can be added via iTunes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
