							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Trip to the Moon</name>
									
			<description>Early space exploration to the moon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple spin and move game based very much on the Jules Verne From the Earth to the Moon novel. The instructions describe a group of men who form the Cannon Club with the objective of firing a projectile (air coach) from a cannon to the moon. The players travel inside the air coach to the moon and return safely to earth.&lt;br/&gt;Two versions of this game exist. A large version (and possibly earlier) is titled &amp;quot;The Journey to the Moon&amp;quot;. This differs from the smaller version by name and having cards that determine the number of spaces a player moves during his turn. The smaller version uses a spinner to direct movement. The larger version includes metal playing pieces that are in the form of both men and women. The smaller version most likely used markers&lt;br/&gt;The playing board has the moon central and imaginary graphics of what space travel might be like in early 20th century. Players advance 35 spaces to reach the moon and another 35 to return to earth. The first player to reach the 70th space by direct number is the winner. Along the way, players landing on red numbers follow the rules to incur either a penalty or benefit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unknown German publisher but from the graphics and costumes on the playing pieces early 20th century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
