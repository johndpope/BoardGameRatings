			<description>Meaning - &amp;quot;Hail Caesar, those who are about to die salute you&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ave Caesar, morituri te salutant is a game of Gladiator combat in a Roman Gladiator arena.  It has 1 to 4 combatants &amp;quot;Gladiators&amp;quot;, plus Beasts, and Slaves!&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics are slightly similar to Combat in the Lists with a new hex tile game board for the arena, 7 direction movement, new character sheets with abilities, new weapons and armor, beasts; such as lions and bears, slaves &amp;quot;non-trained&amp;quot; combatants, new tactics, and all new images and graphics for cards and components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Gladiator has nine equipment counter locations on his reference card:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Head&lt;br/&gt;Left shoulder&lt;br/&gt;Right shoulder&lt;br/&gt;Chest&lt;br/&gt;Groin&lt;br/&gt;Right hand&lt;br/&gt;Left hand&lt;br/&gt;Right leg&lt;br/&gt;Left leg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These [9] locations can hold [9] different pieces of equipment which can be picked up before the match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These new counters make up part of the new mechanics of the game where the equipment and weapons are represented by counters and cards!  The counters fit into specific locations on the player&amp;rsquo;s reference cards and are distributed before the match through a process where each Gladiator takes turns picking a certain number of equipment pieces from an rack.  This process can leave the Gladiators with a mix-match of different types of equipment and weapons but also make for a different game each time its played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each equipment counter is also represented by a Equipment Defense point card, which is used to keep track of the amount of damage a piece of equipment takes during a combat session.  This new system makes up the other part of the new mechanics for Ave Caesar...  Each piece of equipment depending on its type will use up to three different D6 die to help record the amount of damage that piece of equipment can take before it becomes useless. Once the piece of equipment take its max damage allotment, it no longer prevents damage from hitting the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once equipped, the Gladiators take turns moving, fighting, repositioning, devising tactics and strategies to maneuver into position for the best attack and defense. If a Gladiator is killed all his equipment &amp;ldquo;counters&amp;rdquo; are placed on top of his player piece and are available to any of the combatants in the arena!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each weapon and piece of equipment has a card explaining the attack and defense characteristics.  Attach and Defense cards are used for combat to help devise a tactical strategy against other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game will consist of the following components:&lt;br/&gt;A combat arena&lt;br/&gt;Gladiator player reference cards&lt;br/&gt;Weapon cards&lt;br/&gt;Equipment Defense point cards&lt;br/&gt;Animal cards&lt;br/&gt;Slave cards&lt;br/&gt;Attack cards&lt;br/&gt;Defense cards&lt;br/&gt;Specialty type cards for combat and defense - Attack and Defense styles&lt;br/&gt;Player game board pieces&lt;br/&gt;Animal game board pieces &lt;br/&gt;Slave game board pieces&lt;br/&gt;Movement cards&lt;br/&gt;etc...&lt;br/&gt;And a new rules book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
