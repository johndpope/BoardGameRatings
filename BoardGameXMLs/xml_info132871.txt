							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hope Prep #1: The Substitute (M&amp;M 3E)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Bailey's acting strangely... even by his usual standards. In Super Science class, he spent the whole time asking us questions. Then, we saw him actually reading sports news. What's going on?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Substitute is a scenario in the HPS Freshman Year story arc. It may be played as a standalone, or it may be used with first-year characters who are already established in the Hope Preparatory School setting. A map of the gym  and a range of NPCs provide everything a gamemaster needs to run the scenario and experience a day in the life of a metahuman student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario also provides background and game information on Pryde Academy. This institute is an analog of Hope Prep from a parallel dimension. Dedicated to preparing its students for global domination, the Academy&amp;rsquo;s faculty has only recently discovered the HPS earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The [Hope Prep School Freshman Handbook] provides additional details about the HPS setting used in this scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
