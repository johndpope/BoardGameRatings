			<description>Strike It Rich Playing The Stock Market appears to be a Monopoly clone share dealing game, but isn't. The board has the usual track of famous British companies (Tarmac, Racal, Tesco, Courts), decks of Fact Cards and Venture Cards, a die showing cash gains, a huge stack of plastic money chips for each player and a genuine Casio HL-811 calculator in its own box!&lt;br/&gt;You need the calculator because the game also has a book of actual weekly share prices for each company. On your turn, you buy into one firm or another by placing chips onto the board. Later you may sell your investment, making a profit or loss as the prices fluctuate. You draw a Fact Card, which gives info about the price of gold, the currency exchange rates, the FTSE index (the UK's Dow Jones) for a certain week. Based on that info, you decide if your shares will be up or down and whether to sell or hold. If you sell, the Banker checks the actual price in the Market booklet and debits or credits you accordingly. Rolling a VC on the die draws a Venture Card, with the usual hazards and gains to your cash.&lt;br/&gt;More of a crude stock market simulation than a game of strategy, the makers proposed selling fresh decks of Fact Cards and Market booklet for successive years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
