			<description>&amp;quot;Getting the necessary signatures to build the elevated train took both cash and guile.&amp;quot; -- Charles Yerkes, Chicago, 1894&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the 1880&amp;rsquo;s, and Chicago rises like a phoenix from the ashes of the Great Fire. Rail is king in this city on the grow. As a power broker, your pockets are lined by train companies competing to build the new elevated rail system, &amp;ldquo;The Loop.&amp;rdquo; In this game, players work together to build the loop while hiding which line they work for, because everyone is scheming for a big piece of this corruption pie.&lt;br/&gt; In the Loop is a 2-4 player game of puzzle building, tactical planning, and secret motives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: Line your pockets by connecting lines and working to make your line the best. You earn money in two ways: during gameplay, you earn money by connecting lines to route cards. After the game has finished, you earn additional money from the syndicate you secretly work for. Don&amp;rsquo;t let other players deduce who you&amp;rsquo;re working for or they will try to block you. The game ends shortly after the Loop has been completed.&lt;br/&gt; Quick gameplay summary: On your turn, you will place two line cards and one route card. You can also spend your money to make bribes to buy cards or remove previously played cards. Keep in mind that the winner is the player with the most money in the end, so spend wisely! Each turn, you will earn money for each line that connects to the route card you played, and at the end of the game, you will earn money for each time your line appears and each time it connects to a station. The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
