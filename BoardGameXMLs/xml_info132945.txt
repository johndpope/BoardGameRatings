							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale</name>
									
			<description>The gameplay is conceptually similar to the Super Smash Bros. series, in which up to four players can battle each other using characters from various Sony franchises such as God of War, PaRappa the Rapper and Sly Cooper, as well as third-party franchises like BioShock. There are, however, differences in how opponents are defeated. During the game, players damage other players to receive orbs that build up a power meter at the bottom of the screen (These orbs can also be found on the stage over the course of the match). Earning enough power allows players to use one of three levels of super moves which can be used to defeat opponents and earn points. Arenas are also inspired by various PlayStation titles, with some areas mashing up two titles into one (for example, a LittleBigPlanet-themed stage which is mixed with Buzz!). The game will feature cross-platform play between the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
