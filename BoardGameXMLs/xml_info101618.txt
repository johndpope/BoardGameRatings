			<description>From the Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The realm of Allansia has existed for many thousands of years, and hundreds of wars and battles have scarred its inhabitants. Much of once was known has long ago been lost in the mists of the past, and many warnings from history have been ignored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YOU are a veteran of one of the latest wars to trouble the people of this wounded land. King Edwin has been betrayed by his closest advisor, the Archmage Cranmer, and a bloody civil war has split the realm in two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The war is now over. The King is captured, believed dead, and Allansia now belongs to Cranmer. The war was terrible. Many brave warriors have been lost, but you survived the battles, and now you are heading for your home, the small village of Oldmeet, in the hope of gaining some peace after the horrors of the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be no peace for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
