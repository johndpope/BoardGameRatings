			<description>All throughout history, cats have theorized the idea of gravity. Now, cats from all over the world are testing the principles of gravity by knocking objects off of tables and recording the outcome. It is up to you to successfully conduct enough experiments to formulate enough evidence to prove the Law of Gravity. The cat who can successfully complete this task first will forever go down in history as the cat who discovered gravity!&lt;br/&gt;The idea of the game is to collect 6 or more science points to be deemed the &amp;quot;Greatest Science Cat of All Time!&amp;quot; In order to conduct an experiment, you must knock a card off of the table using your Scientific Method. You then apply the rule on the card to the game and MUST follow it to the best of your ability. If you fail to follow a rule in play and another player calls you out on it, you must return a card back into the pile. See who can follow the most laws of science by stacking up more and more rules!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
