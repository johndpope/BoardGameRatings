			<description>Players begin with 4,000 dollars and have the chance to make a fortune or go broke by investing in farms and farm related businesses. A property can be purchased only by landing on it and each time a player must decide whether to invest his limited funds or to hope for something better among the 28 farms and 9 businesses available along the track. Cheaper properties are easier to develop but have a smaller payoff when landed on by an opponent. (just like Monopoly). Another decision must be made regarding the 3 different kinds of crops that may be planted on each farm. Again cheaper pays off sooner but in smaller amounts. Once the crop is in a player can add farm equipment in the form of plastic &amp;quot;silo sections&amp;quot; which are piled in strict color sequence. Limited quantities of the best crops and the highest silo section adds to the decision making process. A player may mortgage a property to pay debt or to make other investments and can still collect 10% of his normal fee from a visiting opponent. Other features include taxes, becoming incorporated, luck cards which can be disastrous, selling properties to an opponent or the treasury.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
