			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ecryme is a French role-playing game by Mathieu Gaborit and William Vincent. The universe is set in a &amp;quot;steampunk&amp;quot; world (science fiction in a society similar to Europe of the nineteenth century).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is composed of island cities, connected by huge bridges. Apart from these connections and the air (airships and some prototype aircraft for the more adventurous), it is impossible to travel from one city to another, because the rest of the world is covered by an ocean made of a corrosive substance that eats everything except stone and metal, Ecryme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The society resembles that of Europe at the beginning of the industrial revolution: the means of production are owned by large corporations, companies, and governments (each city is independent) are a mixture of monarchies and democracies. The proletariat has revolutionary restless impulses, and political aspects occupy a significant place in the game. Technology, strictly controlled by the Lodges, is more or less that of the 19th Century, is similar to the novels of Jules Verne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the Ecryme is not just a simple corrosive substance, but seems to have more or less magical properties. And then some people in this world (C&amp;eacute;phales) have strange powers...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game system is relatively simple. The players distribute points in his six attributes (perception, creation, spirit, liveliness, education, skill) which derived their powers. According to this profile, the player then chooses to increase certain skill sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actions are resolved by introducing a number of D6 (if the action is more difficult, you throw more dice) under the competence score used. The rules are relatively brief, promoting the game at the expense of simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The universe Ecryme is also part of two novels that Mathieu Gaborit published: The Banks of Antipolie (1997, 214 p., ISBN 2-911618-20-3) and Revolutsyia (1997, p 212 . ISBN 2-911618-26-2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
