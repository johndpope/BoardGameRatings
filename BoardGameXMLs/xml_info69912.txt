							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tecmo Bowl</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Tecmo Bowl is an arcade game developed and released in 1987 by Tecmo. While moderately successful in the arcades, the game became and remained widely popular and remembered when it was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988. The NES version was considered by many to be the first American football game to feature real NFL teams and players. Although LJN's NFL Football was the first, it didn't turn out as successful as Tecmo Bowl did. Due to this factor and while the arcade version was rarely found, the NES version eclipsed its arcade counterpart in popularity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original arcade version was distinguished by a large two-monitor cabinet, support for up to four players, and the ability to break tackles. Only two fictional teams can be chosen: the Wildcats and the Bulldogs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NES version allowed two players rather than four from the arcade version. The player could choose between 3 modes: 1 player, 2 players, and coach.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tecmo_Bowl,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
