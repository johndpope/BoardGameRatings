							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">A Las Barricadas</name>
									
			<description>Descriptions from Kickstarter:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Las Barricadas is a boardgame about conflict between two opposing social forces, namely that of the state and of anti-authoritarian demonstrators. It is a two-player game with each player representing one of these social forces, the theatre of this conflict being that of the street demonstration. It is being developed and designed by the Black Flag Games collective, committed to the idea that games and interactive media can have an impact in the struggle for a free and cooperative world. We are also committed to the ideals of free culture and aim to deliver professional play experiences that enrich a participatory entertainment culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'A Las Barricadas' is a two-player, asymmetric boardgame. This means it is a contest between two players whose ability to affect the game is different. Play takes place on a board which represents a real city or historic location, and small chips are placed on building squares (buildings can be occupied, blockaded or vandalized). The Radical player chooses randomly from a small deck of objective cards and both players choose their tactics for the game. Victory is achieved by the Radical player if they complete their objectives in an allotted number of rounds. The Police player only gets a small piece of flavor text as a hint to the objectives of the radical player, and their objective is to keep the radical player from gaining victory points and completing their goals. Many of the objectives relate to acquiring Strike chips (by causing economic loss through blockades, pickets, occupations etc.) or by gaining Media chips (representing media coverage).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
