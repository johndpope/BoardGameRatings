			<description>From the instructions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Bocaro....it's fun, fast and easy to play! Trying to get 12 strikes in a row for a perfect 300 game makes Bocaro exciting.....every time you play.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bocaro is played and scored just like the sport of bowling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player may turn over (roll) two cards in each frame, trying for a count of 10. If the first card is a strike you don't need to roll another card. If the second card is needed and gives you a combined count of more than 10, you only count 10 for a spare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
