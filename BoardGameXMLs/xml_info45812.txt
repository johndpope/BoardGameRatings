			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alma Mater is a role-playing game in which players may choose to be either a Jock, Cheerleader, Tough, Brain, Criminal, Average, or Loser.  Their challenge is to successfully live as a teenager through four years of modern day American high school.  However, play is not restricted to school.  The game rules cover nearly every aspect of teenage life, including sports, social situations, fights, and hot rods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Alma Mater, you can act out your wildest fantasies and do anything that you would normally consider exceptionally foolish, suicidal, or down-right crazy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 48-page rule booklet, illustrated by Erol Otus and Owen Oulton, contains a description of the high school, &amp;quot;Central High&amp;quot; including NPC teacher and student descriptions; and a sample scenario, &amp;quot;Starr's Party&amp;quot;.  Maps for the school and Starr's home are provided along with a 17x22&amp;quot; color poster of the cover painted by Erol Otus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six-sided and twenty-sided dice are required for play, and must be bought separately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WARNING:&lt;br/&gt;This game deals with mature subject matter and is not suitable for children under 14 years of age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
