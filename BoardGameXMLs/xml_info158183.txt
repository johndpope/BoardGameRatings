							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Catacombs: Zombie Horde</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;The Zombie Horde add-on introduces a new zombie monster family distinct from the undead (gray) monsters.  The original Zombie was one of the weakest in the game; his new colleagues are definitely not.  The zombie family features the following zombie monsters:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     5&amp;times; Zombie Prisoner &amp;ndash; disc size medium, 2 health points, monster ability (???).  Everyone's favourite Zombie from the original game with limited edition artwork with a new set of six discs in the new colour (purple).  The set of undead (gray) zombies from the base Catacombs game are removed when playing with the Zombie Horde Add-on.&lt;br/&gt;     2&amp;times; Claw Zombie - disc size medium, 2 health points, monster ability (???)&lt;br/&gt;     2&amp;times; Tomb Zombie - disc size medium, 1 health point, monster ability (???)&lt;br/&gt;     2&amp;times; Zombie Faerie - disc size extra small, 2 health point, monster ability (???)&lt;br/&gt;     4&amp;times; Zombie Ratman - disc size extra small, 1 health point, monster ability (???)&lt;br/&gt;     2&amp;times; Zombie Knight - disc size large, 2 health points, monster ability (???)&lt;br/&gt;     1&amp;times; Zombie Necromancer - disc size large, 4 health points, monster ability: summon Zombie Prisoner, or summon Zombie Ratman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Kickstarter exclusive add-on features 7 monster reference cards describing the members of the new zombie monster family, many of which will have unique special abilities. This is the same number of monsters in the original Vermin expansion.  There are 18 wooden discs in total, which again compares well with the Vermin expansion which had 22 wooden discs (almost all of them being extra small).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hope you enjoy building and flicking your own zombie hordes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
