			<description>The game board consists of a map of the United States showing each state with a hole for where the capitol city is located.  The board itself is an insert in the game box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turn drawing a card from a deck which has the name of a state capitol on it. If the player can correctly name the state, they place a peg of their color into the board and count that states electoral votes as theirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all states have been pegged, candidates add up the points to see who won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Submitter's note: I just picked this up at a flea market for $2.  At first I thought I was missing 2 cards since there were only 48 until I saw the copyright date and realized there were only 48 states back in 1931!  Whoops...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
