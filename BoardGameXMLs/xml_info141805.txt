							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Marple</name>
									
			<description>Getting tired of Sudoku? Why not try Marple?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marple is a game of logic and deduction. The playing field consists of 20 tiles arranged in 4 rows of 5 columns each and a set of clues. The goal of the game is to figure out the correct order of those 20 tiles using the given clues by process of elimination. There are 1,000,000 puzzles to play so don't expect to run out of them any time soon! At 3 minutes / puzzle, 1 hour / day = ca. 137 years of puzzles!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marple was inspired by the PalmOS game Hercule, created by Hippa-Potta Software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
