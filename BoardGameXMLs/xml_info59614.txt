							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Road to Victory: A War Game</name>
									
			<description>A game for 2 to 4 players.  The players roll the die and move around the map following the instructions on the points. There are different routes and a roll of 6 causes the player to go backwards.  The first player to get to Berlin and &amp;quot;Sentence the Nazi Leaders&amp;quot; is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Looks to have been produced just after the invasion of Poland since Denmark, Holland and Belgium have not fallen.  In fact the game talks about Romania joining the Allies and features the Polish Submarine Orzel which escaped to England in 1939.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
