							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kobold Commander</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Often used as battle fodder by dragons and other creatures of evil inclination, Kobold warriors are often not prone to long life. Kobolds are like any other creature however, and if they can survive long enough to grow in prowess, they can rise in the ranks to become a Kobold Commander.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wiser and more deadly than the average Kobold, the Kobold Commander can turn a motley crew of Kobolds into a deadly fighting force that will shock and terrify other races expecting an easy fight.  So effective is the Commander that a few more famous ones have even managed to lead other, non-Kobold humanoids. While these bands and companies are often initially met with ridicule, the Kobold Commander takes a grim joy from proving to its opponents just how wrong they are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
