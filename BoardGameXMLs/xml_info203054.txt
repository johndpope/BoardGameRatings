			<description>IronheadE is a two player card game based around structured play, strategy and timing. Using the cards at their disposal, players build a deck in any way they choose consisting of exactly twenty unique cards. Having built their twenty card decks, players shuffle their cards and draw the top ten cards and now, using those cards, the goal is to have the most points when both players have chosen to not play any further cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you play a card it must be in the correct placement on your grid and all cards after your first must be touching the edge of a card in play, diagonals don't count.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing a card scores you the points written on it, both in the top left and anything you would gain through the ability text. Players keep track of this either on paper or with dice, or whatever you have available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have two options on their turn, play and resolve one card from their hand or pass, but if you pass you can no longer play cards for the rest of the round. When the round ends the player with the higher points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is then repeated until one player wins twice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
