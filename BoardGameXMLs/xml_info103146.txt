			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An action-packed simulation of elite rapid-deployment combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At times of high political tension, secret armies such as the SAS, Spetsnaz and Delta Force form the cutting edge in today's international conflicts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are the special forces that have won - and lost - the most spectacular military operations, in times of peace and war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Special Forces, the sequel to the award winning Airborne Ranger, you take charge of a specially trained team, equipped and organized to operate secretly behind enemy lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter zones of hostility in four different climatic regions, to sabotage, assassinate or rescue, and develop the close-quarter combat skills and personal survival techniques needed to complete your mission before the enemy even knows you're there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under cover, outnumbered and alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Gather intelligence about the enemy and plan lines of attack for a wide range of terrain, climate and environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Control your men individually or co-ordinate the activities of the team. Create diversions, use covering fire and employ the tactics used by elite rapid-deployment forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Select your team by studying the specialist skills required for each of the sixteen missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Special Forces is an exciting combination of action, strategy, danger and suspense which will push your decision-making skills and reflexes to the limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
