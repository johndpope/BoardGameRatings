			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second in a series known at the time for its full range of 3D motion, allowing you to move in any direction, Descent II picks up where Descent left off, with more weapons, more robots, and more deep, dangerous mines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Material Defender for the PTMC, you have saved the company from a dangerous virus that infected several of their mining and labor robots.  However, as a contracted mercenary, you should have read the fine print.  As it turns out, you can be held on retainer in their service for another three days, and refusal to comply means you don't get paid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It should be a simple job; all you need is a little reconnaissance, right?  Of course it's never that easy.  It seems the virus that has been infecting the PTMC's mining robots and driving them to attack their creators is still at large and taking over more of their very profitable mines.  Your job, whether or not you choose to accept it, is to wipe out these dysfunctional bots, save as many of their scientists and mine-workers from certain death, and collapse the tunnels in each mineshaft to prevent the further proliferation of this dangerous virus.  PTMC is counting on you, Material Defender!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
