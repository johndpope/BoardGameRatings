							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Axis of Evil II: War on the Southern Axis</name>
									
			<description>Axis of Evil II covers potential conflicts in the Greater Middle East in the near future. The game map includes Iran, the Caucasus, Syria, Iraq, the Persian Gulf States and points adjoining. Scenario include the US-Coalition invading Iran to take out the country's nuclear power, a massive Islamic insurgency, a Russian drive to the Gulf, and more. Units are operational commands, SOF and airpower with an element of cyberwar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game system is based on Putin Moves South which in turn drew heavily from Ty Bomba's Putin's War. Command control is vital for coordinating forces across the region -- this is represented by an action point system. Netrocentric capable units have an advantage in C2 and often small hi-tek elite forces can get more accomplished than mass armies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can use your pool of SOF to give conventional units shifts in combat, but this expends them for a random number of turns. So you have to plan out your SOF allocation. Also, seizing bases is vital, as their occupation can provide additional action points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
