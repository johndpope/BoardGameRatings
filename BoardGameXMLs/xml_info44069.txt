			<description>Nightsider&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a logical explanation for everything&amp;hellip; but it isn&amp;rsquo;t always the truth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fang Island has long been a popular vacation resort for those wealthy enough to enjoy such things. The top-secret military base at its northern end has made the island even more attractive, adding a sense of security in a dark and sometimes deadly world. But now all contact with the island has been suddenly and mysteriously cut off, and it is under military quarantine. No one is allowed to cross the cordon; they&amp;rsquo;re turned back for &amp;ldquo;security reasons&amp;rdquo; to protect &amp;ldquo;a wonderful scientific breakthrough.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, on the coast, people are disappearing in the woods. But locals insist that there is no reason to be alarmed. People do get lost in the wilderness, and rural regions have been known to attract wandering axe murderers on occasion. No need to propose some great &amp;ldquo;conspiracy&amp;rdquo; theory to explain a few missing persons, or even several grisly deaths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a little harder to explain whole cars disappearing &amp;ndash; with everyone inside &amp;ndash; as they travel down a busy highway. But it isn&amp;rsquo;t impossible. Perhaps these people don&amp;rsquo;t want to be found.&lt;br/&gt;Or maybe there really is something dark and sinister going on. Some otherworldly evil that ties these events together. If there is, you better discover what it is and defeat it&amp;hellip; before you join the ranks of its prey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nightsider consists of a 32-page book with three ready-to-play, interlinked adventures (enough for at least three to six play sessions) inside a beautiful full-color, four-panel map screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
