			<description>[Wikipedia: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Space&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Space&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer Space is a video arcade game released in November 1971 by Nutting Associates. Created by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, who would both later found Atari, it is generally accepted that it was the world's first commercially sold coin-operated video game, and indeed, the first commercially sold video game of any kind, predating the Magnavox Odyssey by six months, and Atari's Pong by one year. Though not commercially sold, the coin operated minicomputer driven Galaxy Game preceded it by two months, located solely at Stanford University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
