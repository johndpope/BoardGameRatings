			<description>Maryland, My Maryland is an upcoming game in LPD Games' Battles of the American Civil War series.  From LPD's website: &amp;quot;Antietam represented the best opportunity for the Army of the Potomac to win the war at one blow. Major General George B. McClellan's command style was an important part of why this did not occur. Once again, BACW's command and initiative system has to pick up the slack, allowing the Federal player some control of the battle while showing just how the Little Mac's dysfunctional command style prevented complete victory. The Confederate player faces Lee's greatest challenge - winning against 2:1 odds. Includes South Mountain, the precursor to Antietam, and Harper's Ferry, a classic race against time for divergent objectives.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
