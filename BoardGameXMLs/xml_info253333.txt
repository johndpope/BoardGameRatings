			<description>Daggers is a two player micro game. The game is about the size of a deck of playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players attempt to accrue the most points by playing a numbered card on each of their turns. Their hand is finite and cards are drawn rarely. They must use the resources they are given in clever ways to win two out of three rounds of play. Special Arcana cards can drastically effect the game, each offering a unique power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daggers feels like it belongs in a rich fantasy world. Both the look and play of the game make it seem like a living and immersive piece of a fantasy setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The art and feel of Daggers draws on the iconic images of the tarot. Both in name and depiction the cards have an esoteric flavor that add an air of romanticized mystery to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you've ever experienced the trope of the seedy fantasy tavern, be it in a movie, a book, or perhaps a role-playing game, then you know the scene is not complete without a few shady characters gambling in the greasy lantern light. The game they are playing is Daggers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
