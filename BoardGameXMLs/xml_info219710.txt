							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Orthanc: The Dark Seed Quest</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario describes the entry level and two of the dungeon levels of Saruman's tower of Orthanc, based on an alternate history of Tolkien's Middle-earth.  In the scenario, Orthanc has been abandoned and largely is in ruins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is an unpublished manuscript - Tracy and Laura Hickman papers for Orthanc role-playing game; MSS 8180; Tracy and Laura Hickman papers; L. Tom Perry Special Collections; Literary Manuscripts; 1130 Harold B. Lee Library; Brigham Young University; Provo, Utah 84602.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario has a manila card cover with (apparently) professionally printed graphics.  The text is typewritten, single-sided pages, with numbering.  Several maps are included, many of them laminated.  Not all maps are labeled, however.  The scenario is three-hole punched.  The scenario includes about twenty pages of maps and notes from an unrelated science-fiction scenario (almost certainly a filing error).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is divided into three &amp;quot;chapters&amp;quot;.  Each chapter begins with a 2-3 page fictional introduction and then proceeds to a keyed room-by-room description of a single level of the tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapter 1 describes &amp;quot;The Hall of the March of Kings&amp;quot;, which is the main entrance level of the tower.  Based on illustrations included in the manuscript, this entrance level is well above ground level, accessed through a long and steep set of stairs.  The original function of the level was the &amp;quot;reception of guests&amp;quot;.  The level consists of seventeen keyed areas, and opponents include bandits, a gelatinous cube, and an evil cleric.  It is unclear whether levels above the entrance level were contemplated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapter 2 describes &amp;quot;Oracles &amp;amp; The Tower Guard&amp;quot;, which is the level beneath the entrance level.  The original function of the level was the &amp;quot;housing and care of tower guards&amp;quot; and also for &amp;quot;mining rich ore&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;slave quarters&amp;quot;.  The ore referred to appears to have been external to the tower.  The level consists of thirty keyed areas, and opponents include a gelatinous cube, zombies, orcs, a sixth-level magic user, and a trapper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapter 3 describes &amp;quot;Lockholes&amp;quot;, which is the next level down.  The original function of the level was &amp;quot;prisoner security&amp;quot; and the provision of &amp;quot;support areas&amp;quot; for the guard.  The level appears as a maze of corridors with numerous small rooms (&amp;quot;lockholes&amp;quot;) used as prison cells.  The level consists of thirty-five keyed areas (many containing multiple cells), and opponents include giant centipedes, orcs, and two seventh-level evil clerics.  This level is unique in providing a partially complete table of random encounters (&amp;quot;wandering monsters&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerous maps are included in the scenario:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Unlabeled partial lower level&lt;br/&gt;        Laminated unlabeled level (probably level 1)&lt;br/&gt;        Two illustrations that appear to be simple maps&lt;br/&gt;        Laminated &amp;quot;Level G&amp;quot;, subtitled &amp;quot;Seeds of Saruman Quest&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;        Three minor variants of a map labeled &amp;quot;Level III Orthank&amp;quot; (note &amp;quot;k&amp;quot;); two are laminated, one appears to be a play-generated map&lt;br/&gt;        Two unlabeled maps - based on the keyed areas and the rooms these almost certainly are the third level &amp;quot;lockholes&amp;quot;; one appears to be a design balance tally - they are significantly different from the three &amp;quot;Level III Orthank&amp;quot; maps noted above&lt;br/&gt;        Two minor variants of a map labeled &amp;quot;Level 5 Treasure Hold&amp;quot;; one is laminated; one appears to be a design balance tally; they both note the level as 165 rooms&lt;br/&gt;        Unlabeled map&lt;br/&gt;        Unlabeled map and on reverse several unlabeled map fragments&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These two maps appear related to each other but likely are not part of the scenario (though included with it) - they are on different graph paper and have a different visual appearance:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Unlabeled map with fragment of second map&lt;br/&gt;        Unlabeled map&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four pages of illustrations of the tower are provided; it has a unique outline - and appears to be in good repair (as illustrated).  One illustration appears to show the tower floating in air (may simply be an incomplete rendering).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General comments.  The manuscript is available for public access in a controlled reading room environment (photography, copies, etc., are not permitted).  The loose pages in the manuscript are stored in a folder and the pages are mingled with approximately 20 pages from an obviously unrelated science-fiction locale.  The page count indicated here is a &amp;quot;best estimate&amp;quot; because it's unclear whether all maps belong to the scenario and because many maps have duplicate copies.  The design suggests at least a few more deep levels were contemplated.  The scenario is more developed than most &amp;quot;homebrew&amp;quot; dungeons, but not as developed as a commercial module.  The fusion of proprietary game system with unrelated proprietary setting indicates the scenario probably was not contemplated for commercial release.  The scenario appears to date from about 1980.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
