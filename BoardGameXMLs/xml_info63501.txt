			<description>This Persian  uses a special deck of 25 cards in 5 suits. Two cards are dealt to each of the five players.&lt;br/&gt;They bet or fold. Each player remaining in the game is dealt two more cards. They make an additional bet or fold. Each remaining player gets a fifth and final card, then they bet a final time or fold. Those who are still in the game show their hands and the highest ranking hand wins. The rank of hands is quite similar to that of Poker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many experts say this game was played in the 16th or 17th century in Persia, hence it is a predecessor of Poker. Others claim there is no description of this game till 1890, and since As is not a Persian word but French for Ace, it may only be the Persian interpretation of Poker, using the prviously existing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
