			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep the space highway open by clearing (and keeping clear) eight action packed screens ALL AT ONCE! A startling original arcade game from the author of Trailblazer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally written by Shaun Southern for the Commodore 64, then converted by Steve Parys to the ZX Spectrum, Laserwheel is a shoot-em-up with a difference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a ship in the centre of a circular play area. The player can rotate clockwise or anticlockwise and fire. Enemies and bombs rotate around the edge of the screen and need to be shot. The difference is that there are eight of these screens (representing eight sectors of space) which can be switched between at will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to keep at least one of these screens from being destroyed for as long as possible. Bombs are the main reason that a sector can be damaged. The eight sectors are shown on your scanner, with an indication of whether a bomb is on the screen, how close it is to exploding, and the damage currently sustained by that sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shooting certain enemies protects the sector from bombs for a certain time, or can repair some of the damage to the sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over when the sector the player is currently in is destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is called &amp;quot;Laserwheel&amp;quot; in-game, but the inlay calls it &amp;quot;Lazerwheel&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Lazer Wheel&amp;quot;. Reviews in magazines of the time are similarly confused!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
