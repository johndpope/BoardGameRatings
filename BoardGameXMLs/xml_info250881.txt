			<description>Dominations: Road to Civilization is a 2 &amp;ndash; 4 player game by Olivier Melison and Eric Dubus. In this domino-based Civilisation building game, players take on the role of a primitive tribe, which they will seek to grow into a Nation whose influence will echo through the ages&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place your triangular Dominos carefully to expand your population and obtain the Knowledge that will determine how your society is shaped over time. You can use this Knowledge to build Cities and master Skills; thus creating the legacy for which your Civilisation will be remembered. Each time you master a Skill, it becomes one of the pillars of your society, opening doors to new possibilities and increasing your power. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
