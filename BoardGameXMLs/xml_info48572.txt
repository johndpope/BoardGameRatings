							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pokéthulhu Adventure Game (1st Edition)</name>
									
			<description>This was the initial edition of the game, 100 copies of which were sold at Gen Con 2000.  The later edition was substantially expanded and saw much wider release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is not evil which can eternal lie,&lt;br/&gt;and with strange aeons even death may die!&lt;br/&gt;To bring down our masters on an icy night,&lt;br/&gt;And to claim the power when the stars are right&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;Derleth!&lt;br/&gt;Bloch!&lt;br/&gt;Team Eibon! Stand fast to resist our rage&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;Or flee to the safety of a new dark age!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTAGHN! THAT'S RIGHT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amid the sagging gables of old New England, evil lurks&amp;hellip;and squirms and scuttles, and purrs. Grownups are fleeing in terror, hiding behind the Elder Sign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're 10 years old. Your our last hope. Armed with a Shining Dodecahedron and the elder incantations to make it work, you capture the monsters and train them to use their power&amp;hellip; But not for evil. For sport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've thrilled to the popular TV show. Now, you can play the game! Is your shoplifting score good enough to sneak a page from your opponent's Pok&amp;eacute;nomicon? Is your trained Jigglypolyp powerful enough to defeat a devolved Fungal Cluster? This is the world of Pok&amp;eacute;thulhu, and now it's yours to save&amp;mdash;or conquer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;squishy_brain_games@hotmail.com (We know, we suck. There will be a website and real e-mail address soon, we swear!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
