			<description>Afterworld: Earth Reborn captures the earth's apocalyptic fall into darkness slightly after a decade-long golden period in which people lived longer, explored their minds both intellectually and spiritually more than ever, created grandiose machines and robots, and lived in relative peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The actual game takes place in an opportunity-deprived environment (making nods to the steampunk genre) that is dominated by several characters--both good and evil in nature.  There's grown and spliced creatures; sinister, calculated robots; demented magical incantations; and fervent warriors/scholars from assorted historical and fantasy sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to acquire victory points, which are gained through several different types of actions.  Gameplay involves several cards that create a gameboard; are drawn and played by players; and dictate what players do (through an avatar).  Players take turns gaining resources, playing cards, and fighting creatures as they interact with the board and opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
