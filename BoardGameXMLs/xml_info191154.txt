							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tr011</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He knows how to get under your skin&amp;hellip; Tr011!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level 11 Rogue, Tr011 (aka Troll) is a brute who loves to hurt people. He is an iconic character in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tr011's file is designated &amp;quot;Violet&amp;quot; to indicate his powers are the result of a powerful arcane spell. Cursed with a body that reflects the ugliness of his personality, Tr011 is a powerhouse and a psychic vampire rolled into one! At home lurking online or throwing down in the street, he&amp;rsquo;s the kind of villain who can easily become a long-term problem for any hero who wants to maintain some kind of normal life. He can be played as a dangerous stalker, or simply as an annoying jerk who knows how to push a player character&amp;rsquo;s buttons. He&amp;rsquo;s also a great lieutenant for a villainous mastermind who needs some tough muscle to occupy the heroes while other plans unfold. Tr011 comes with stats and standees for four super-beasts she can transform into, all illustrated in full color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
