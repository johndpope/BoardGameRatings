			<description>A gorgeous game in resin, coming in a huge wooden box. Two players or teams must dig for the Pharao's treasure, finding hints that will help them in the search. The valley of the Sphinx is made of little 3D spaces in resin that can be lifted to see what's under. A guide with the reproduction of real ancient Egyptian documents is featired to translate the hieroglyphics and identify Pharaos' names. The cost was impressive (150.000 liras - equivalent of 77.50 euros that was a really huge sum in mid '90s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
