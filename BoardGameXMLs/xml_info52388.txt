							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trident RMBK</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Grav Vehicle from Trident/RMBK has been shot down in the wilderness. On board are the secrets of RMBK's advanced science, including the answer to the mysteries of the DRGN Combat Suit. Your team has been assigned to the search... but the Imperium is also hunting for the downed vehicle, with all the forces at its disposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your search will take you deep into the wilderness, through the ruins of a bombed-out Subcon, and into deadly combat with the most powerful Imperial unit you have ever faced: the top-secret Imperial Robotics Section, a covert unit which uses illegal technology to do the bidding of the Imperium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trident/RMBK will test the skills of your entire Operation Team, from the Swords in their Living Steel to the members of the Alpha Teams. Those who pass the test will wield the full power of the DRGN Combat Suit, and will be ready to take the next step in the quest for RMBK's lost technology.&lt;br/&gt;Trident/RMBK is a scenario for the Living Steel High-Tech Adventure Game, and begins to reveal the story of Trident's renegade RMBK division and its technological breakthroughs. Background on Trident/RMBK is included, as well as Skirmish and Search rules, and complete information on the Imperial Robotics Section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
