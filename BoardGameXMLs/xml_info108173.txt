							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rampage of the Ebon Fur</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BEWARE THE EBON FUR!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once, Nrak was a simple Furry - a spiritual warrior in the battle for the soul of mankind. When he was captured and tortured by his racial enemies, the Slimeys, he thought he would surely die in their grasp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What happened was so much worse than he could have imagined - in defeating the Slimeys in a battle of wills, he became something no longer Furry and not quite Slimey - he became the Ebon Fur, a being of nearly unlimited potential and an equally unlimited craving for the fear, pain, and death of any sentient creature he could get his paws (and/or tentacles) on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This refers heavily to material in our supplements Inner Darkness and Yiffy, Yaoi, and Yahooey!, which will also come in very useful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included is information about the Ebon Fur, his plans, and his depraved plan for Furries, Slimeys, and anyone he can get his manipulative appendages on.  This book plumbs the depths to which a sentient mind can sink when it becomes addicted to inflicting pain, fear, and death - readers should be warned that it contains highly explicit and objectionable materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
