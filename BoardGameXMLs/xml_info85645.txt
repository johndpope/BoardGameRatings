			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B-1 NUCLEAR BOMBER&lt;br/&gt;Computer Simulation GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7 July 1991: You are the commander of a B-1 supersonic bomber flying a routine strategic deterrence mission over Thule Air Force Base, Greenland. The radio man reports receiving a top-priority coded message from the Airborne Command Post:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War Plan Alpha-5. This is not a drill.&lt;br/&gt;Repeat&lt;br/&gt;War Plan Alpha-5. This is not a drill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You swallow hard, trying not to think of your wife and children, sleeping at this moment unaware in their comfortable suburban Maryland home near Washington, D.C. There are no safe rear areas in nuclear war. Slowly and deliberately, you dial the combination of the safe you hoped you would never have to open, throw the bolt, and remove the sealed envelope marked ALPHA-5. Opening it, you read&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Target: Lat. 56N, Long. 38E (Moscow)&lt;br/&gt;Failsafe Arming Code: XREED&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You get a course to Moscow from the navigator, turn the nose of your B-1 toward the U.S.S.R., and prepare to carry out your mission. Perhaps if your family is lucky they will die quickly in their sleep. Meanwhile, your job is to make sure that aggression is punished. The politicians will have to try to pick up the pieces later, if any . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game gives you the opportunity to be the captain of a B-1 bomber on a mission over the Soviet Union. You must fly the plane through the stiff Russian defenses to the target city, bomb it, and return home. Your computer controls the Soviet air defense bases with their almost unlimited numbers of MIG's (fighters) and SAM's (surface-to-air missiles). Your only chance to get through is to rely on the superior technology of your sophisticated ECM (electronic counter measures) and self-defense missiles. When all else fails, you can try violent evasive maneuvers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
