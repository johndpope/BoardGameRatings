							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Killer Crosshairs</name>
									
			<description>A generic location damage system which includes a number of target silhouettes as well as two transparent overlays to check roll against hit placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subtitle: ...What Gun Control was Meant to be!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Cover and Back:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An interactive hit location and damage system for all roleplaying games. For use with Firearm, Melee Weapon and Hand-to-Hand Combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Killer Crosshairs in a unique visual targeting system that takes the guesswork out of roleplaying combat. It includes simple conversions for most RPG dice systems, and requires only a single additional die roll. It tells you exactly where you hit or by how much you missed, and it works with firearms, melee weapons, and hand-to-hand combat. Its simple design makes Killer Crosshairs compatible with almost any game system. It works with the rules to increase realism and excitement of any combat encounter. In addition, should your game system not cover damage by location, Killer Crosshairs provides universal injury tables to describe the results of your targeted hits; fractures, concussions, organ damage, etc. The tables lend just enough detail to give players a real feeling for the effects of injury while being simple enough to keep the action fast and furious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
