			<description>Toplshteyner (Yiddish for dice) Is a new dice game from the mind of Christopher Bush. Fun and fast paced, Toplshteyner can be played for money or just for fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game: To be the last man standing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Each player starts the game with three lives. Each life is represented by an amount of money agreed upon before the start of the game (50p or 50c a life for example). If playing for fun, just exchange the money for three of anything you can get your hands on. Poker chips, matchsticks etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Determine who is going to roll first by each rolling a die. The highest number rolls first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The first player rolls the dice. They will have either rolled a &amp;ldquo;point&amp;rdquo; or a &amp;ldquo;consequence&amp;rdquo;. All double rolls (1-1, 2-2, 3-3 etc.) are consequence rolls. Every other combination, except those that equal seven, acts as a point roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Consequence rolls have different effects on the game. See the &amp;ldquo;List of Consequences&amp;rdquo; section for full details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    If a player rolls a point, they must attempt to re-roll that point before they roll a seven. If they manage to re-roll their point, their life is safe and the dice go to the next player. If they roll a seven, they lose a life and the dice goes to the next player. Note: Seven NEVER acts as the point. If a seven is the first number rolled, the player must continue to roll the dice until a valid point or consequence has been rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;List of Consequences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    1-1 &amp;ldquo;Snake Eyes&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Player loses a life. Valid only once per turn. If rolled first the player will lose a life then their point will be two. Rolling double one for the second time will save you a life, not cost you one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    2-2 &amp;ldquo;Saving Grace&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Players life is safe and their turn is over. Play moves on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    3-3 &amp;ldquo;Threes&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Even if a point has already been set, if 3-3 is rolled, the point is changed to six. The player must then attempt to re-roll a six before they roll a seven, but if they do so by re-rolling 3-3, ALL lives are lost and they lose the game entirely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    4-4 &amp;ldquo;Crazy Eight&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Point is set or reverted to two. The player will not lose a life by rolling 1-1. But their odds of re-rolling their point before rolling a seven have vastly decreased.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    5-5 &amp;ldquo;High Fives&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Elect a player to lose a life. If rolled first it acts as both the point AND the consequence. Valid only once per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    6-6 &amp;ldquo;Trick Sixes&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Extra Life to a maximum of four lives. Extra lives earned can be reclaimed from the pot if the player has less than three lives. The fourth life is optional because it must come out of the players own pocket. Note: If playing for fun, the fourth life can be taken from the pot also.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
