			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cthulhu Dark is a tabletop roleplaying game of cosmic horror, set in the worlds of H.P. Lovecraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's about the things we fear, amplified until they are unbearable. It's about stories that genuinely creep you out, not well-worn tropes and creatures you've seen hundreds of times before. And it's about bleak horror, in which humans are powerless when confronted by hyperintelligent alien horrors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can't beat them. You can't fight them. You can only watch, run, hide and fear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this book, you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;- Cthulhu Dark's streamlined, flexible rules.&lt;br/&gt;- How to write and play mysteries, taking you through step-by-step from your initial ideas to describing horror to your players.&lt;br/&gt;- A guide to the threats of the Mythos, from the Colour Out Of Space to Erich Zann, showing you how to use aliens, artifacts and sorcery to enhance the horror.&lt;br/&gt;- Four settings, taking your games through time and space, each with a mystery to play through:&lt;br/&gt;    - Arkham 1692, Lovecraft's legendary ancient city in the time of witches.&lt;br/&gt;    - London 1851, where horror hides in the dark and the stink of Victorian England.&lt;br/&gt;    - Jaiwo 2017, in which evil emerges from the ruins of Empire in Africa.&lt;br/&gt;    - Mumbai 2037, tales of twisted cyberpunk horror in near-future India.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
