			<description>From the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For less than the price of 1/2 hour of tutoring, your child can master all their basic math skills...and enjoy it way more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathino is the ultimate math card game. Using math operations, capture the cards on the table with the cards from your hand. Players can change the values of the cards on the table on their turn, but watch out, someone else can change it to something that will let them capture that stack by the end of the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathino lets anyone sharpen their mental process by looking ahead a few moves to capture cards. It's a perfect math tutor and can be played by nearly anyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operations used in the game can be determined based on player age and skill level and include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Matching shapes and colors, counting for the very young&lt;br/&gt;-Addition&lt;br/&gt;-Subtraction&lt;br/&gt;-Multiplication&lt;br/&gt;-Division&lt;br/&gt;-Squaring and Cubing&lt;br/&gt;-Square and Cube Rooting&lt;br/&gt;-Sum of the Digits&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
