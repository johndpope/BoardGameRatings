			<description>This game was published in spielbox 1992 #5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ascot is board game about a horse racing for 2 to 18 players. Game components: the game board (six racing lines &amp;ndash; one for each horse, numbered columns, representing forwards or backwards movements), 6 horses in 6 different colors, 108 betting slips (each 18 in the colors of the horses), 72 movement cards in neutral color. For each horse, there are 12 cards (3x &amp;quot;+&amp;quot;, 2x &amp;quot;++&amp;quot;, 1x &amp;quot;+++&amp;quot;, 3x &amp;quot;-&amp;quot;, 2x &amp;quot;- -&amp;quot;, and 1x &amp;quot;- - -&amp;quot;). The start position of each horse is the field of its respective line in the central column. Each player gets six betting slips (one of each color) and an amount of the 72 movement cards, previously shuffled and distributed among them. The objective of the players is to give adequate movement cards to the player nominated as game Master, trying to influence the position of the horses during the racing. Simultaneously, the players may change betting slips with each other, trying to achieve the best winnings. For that, the players are free to communicate among them and change both betting slips and movement cards. During the racing, the players can give to the game Master movement cards, face down. After each five cards are so played, the Master moves the corresponding horses according to these movement cards. The game ends after a predetermined number of rounds played and the players receive points according to their bets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
