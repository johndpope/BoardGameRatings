			<description>Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dynamite Cop&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamite Cop (Dynamite Deka 2 in Japan) (1998) is a video game published by Sega and initially released in arcades on Sega Model 2 hardware. The game was then ported to the Sega Dreamcast console and released in Japan, North America and Europe. Dynamite Cop is a 1 or 2 player, 3D beat 'em up in which players fight through levels to save the president's daughter from a band of modern day pirates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's predecessor, Dynamite Deka, was released in Europe and North America for arcades and the Sega Saturn with a Die Hard licence, titled Die Hard Arcade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its main character, Delinger (who would have been John McClane if this game had been given the Die Hard license), makes a cameo appearance in The House of the Dead 2 as a playable character via a special item obtainable in the original mode (present in home versions of The House of the Dead 2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The classic Sega arcade game Tranquilizer Gun (1980) is included as a bonus game. Clearing all missions will enable you to play Tranquilizer Gun an unlimited number of times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with the original's striking resemblance to the movie Die Hard, Dynamite Cop bore many similarities to the action movie Speed 2: Cruise Control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
