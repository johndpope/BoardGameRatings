							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chequero</name>
									
			<description>The object is to capture all of your opponent's Chequeros.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin, all sliders are placed to the far right. At this point, the board looks like a regular Checkers board. A player's Chequeros are placed on the eight spots in the back row of their side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player's turn begins by sliding one of the rows, and then moving a piece. The direction of movement is dependent on the color of the square - diagonally if on white, straight if on blue. The piece follows the line as far as the color is uninterrupted. Only Kings may move backwards. No pieces may move sideways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player captures their opponents Chequeros when they are on a space in the path of the player's move. The captured Chequero is removed, and the capturing Chequero stops in that spot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
