			<description>One More Hour&lt;br/&gt;A Main Course RPG of Temporary Reprieves&lt;br/&gt;an Iron Game Chef Entry for 2006&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One More Hour is the fourth RPG in the Full Course of Love and Death, coming between the second main course of The Marriage of Persephone and the last, That Oh So Little Death. You play the same team as you did in The Marriage of Persephone, except due to the favor you received in that game, you have been given a chance to come back and right the wrongs of your untimely death. Unfortunately, your strand has already been cut, so you have only an hour to make that difference. After One More Hour, That Oh So Little Death acts as a ending for the entire full course, but will likely involve at least one hero from the team. Like all games in this Full Course, One More Hour is intended for five players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a game designed for Iron Game Chef 2006, it is necessary to discuss the allotments made for that contest. Indeed, for the theme of time, One More Hour fulfills 8 hours requirement, spread among any number of sessions. And it uses the following contest terms: Glass, Law, Steel, and Team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
