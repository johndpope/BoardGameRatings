							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Color Gin</name>
									
			<description>Color Gin was published in A Gamut of Games. It is a game derived from Gin Rummy, but you must score points separately for all four suits. So effectively you are playing four games at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You score points in the same way as Gin Rummy, but the following condition prevents you from scoring in a suit:&lt;br/&gt;An unmatched card&lt;br/&gt;A sequence stop&lt;br/&gt;Missing suit in a three of a kind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can only go if you can score in at least one game, and as any player scores 100 points total in a suit, that suit stops counting points, so you must pay attention have points only in suits that are now worthless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
