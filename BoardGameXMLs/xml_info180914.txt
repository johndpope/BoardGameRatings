			<description>Troquons! is a game of bartering. What the name doesn't tell you is that it allows you create mean, stupid, brilliant or dumb maxims and proverbs. Thanks to Troquons! you'll get morally subtle gifts, capable of summarizing life in several strong images. But watch yourself, you risk every moment looking like an absolute idiot. Deeply cerebral or a medical mystery, such is the unpredictable journey to the land of clowning around!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives 3 cards: subject + verb + moral. From the beginning, you have a proverb in hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The barter phase begins: you can swap one or more cards as many times as you want between players and/or only once with the pile! Thus, your proverb may become &amp;quot;the artist in you + is a slobbering Mmnster + speaks him gently in his ear&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player reads their proverb and must reveal their viewpoint  if another player asks &amp;quot;but what you meant by that?&amp;quot;. Luck and your barter strategy, combined with your imagination, will make you defend or justify the indefensible &amp;quot;maxims&amp;quot; to make them... brilliant!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The voting phase closes the round: every player submits  a secret ballot of 1 card of &amp;quot;you're awesome&amp;quot; to the author of the best proverb and 1 card of &amp;quot;let's barter!&amp;quot; to the one who deserves it! If you receive the Awesome card, it's worth 1 point (i.e. 1 blue cube), while a &amp;quot;let's barter&amp;quot; card is just a friendly message that expresses condolences and to try again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Troquons! is a very simple and addictive game that will make you appear sometimes as a great and gifted philosopher gifted of profound reflexion and decisive for the future of mankind, and sometimes as a schemer trying desperately to justify a proverb that is worth not a cent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
