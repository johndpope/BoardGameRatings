			<description>The Saber-Toothed Cats are on a scavenger hunt across the tar pit.  Watch out!  The tar is sticky, and sometimes the cats get stuck.  The Saber Toothed Cat that can remember which tiles to avoid will be the fastest tar tracker and wind the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, tiles (some of them secretly magneztic, some not) are laid out on a board. Each player's task is to move their animal to the 6 numbered tiles on the sides of the board, in a given order (blue saber-toothed cat has to visit blue 1 first, then blue 2 etc., until they reach blue 6). Player pieces start from the middle. An animal can moved to adjacent tiles as long as they are not &amp;quot;stuck in the mud&amp;quot; which means they don't step on magnetized tiles. When they do, the player's turn ends and it's the next player's turn. Whoever reaches their 6 first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
