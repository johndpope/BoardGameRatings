			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over a century ago, the kingdom of Unaya was embroiled in a bitter war with a neighboring nation, Caldar. Though the squabble that started the war soon became forgotten, the war raged on for many years. One of Unaya&amp;rsquo;s prized weapons in this conflict was its dogs of war &amp;ndash; tenacious beasts with a fear-inducing howl and jaws like bear traps. The dogs were trained in a great compound, but little remains of that compound now. That is until you descend the stairs into the labyrinth underground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dogs of War is a fantasy adventure for the Entropic Gaming System, suitable for dark fantasy, fantasy horror, and epic fantasy settings. It&amp;rsquo;s presented as a single location and can be used at various character ranks to better fit into your adventures and campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dogs of War is a complete standalone adventure. It only requires the Entropic Gaming System core rulebook. Additionally, it features 5 new Adversaries and a magical weapon that can be used in any setting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
