							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Animal Crackers Game</name>
									
			<description>[NOTE: There are two other animal cracker games, so don't get confused!]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one is a simple children's game.  The board contains spaces with numbers, as well as spaces without numbers.  Players place their pawns on a non-numbered spot to begin the game.  A card is drawn showing a number that corresponds to one of the numbered spots on the board.  Players take turns attempting to land on that spot. How many spots a player moves on his/her turn is determined by a spinner.  Whichever player lands on the spot first collects the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another card is drawn, and the same routine continues until all cards are distributed and the winner is the player with the most cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
