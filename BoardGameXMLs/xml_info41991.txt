			<description>Sun &amp;amp; Moon is a building game designed for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game and its Nocturne Expansion.  It is for two teams of 1, 2, or 3 players (in other words, it's a game specifically for 2, 4, or 6 players).  One team represents the sun cult (orange); the other, the moon cult (black).  The players sit around the table such that the turns will alternate between teams.  With the board set up using bars to divide the outer ring into quarters, and one druid in each of 5 colors on the outer ring, players take turns moving druids and taking actions based upon the movement.  All the druids start out in the building quarter, where the various enormous stones of the trilithons are available for construction, but must make laps of the outer ring in order to collect the energy to build the magnificent Stonehenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may move a druid from a quadrant to the building quarter, spending one card of its color for each quadrant it moves, and one card of its color for each existing stone in his color's trilithon (black cards are wild).  This builds a piece of that trilithon, and scores your team a point.  You may overpay in order to get extra points.&lt;br/&gt;Alternatively, if you move a druid from one quadrant to the next, you draw two cards, keeping one in your hand, and putting the other face-up in front of you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you build on a trilithon, you automatically use any appropriate cards your team has face-up on the table.  This also discards any cards of the trilithon's color the opposing team has on the table.  Additionally, each team has a secret trilithon bonus card:  Once that trilithon is complete, that team gets an extra two points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sun &amp;amp; Moon is an official game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game and the Nocturne Expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
