			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fairly common for randomly generated treasure to include a few mundane or low-value items. While these may be appreciated and hoarded for the few coins they can raise at low-levels, fairly early in most campaigns players stop caring much about items taken from the standard equipment tables (players only appreciate so many sunrods). However, sometimes a GM wants to spark some interest and mystery without handing out a major magic item, or at least make a world seem more in-depth by providing some colorful items that suggest they have a backstory behind them. To assist in such efforts, this product provides 110 odd little items, none of which will be of great use to players, but all of which might pique their interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To be on the list, an item had to be small enough to fit in a pocket, belt pouch, or backpack. Its weight had to be negligible, and its value low. None of these items give bonuses to rolls or checks. Rather, the items were designed to encourage players to ask questions and to act as starting points for GMs who wanted to introduce some new story hooks. These are creative motes and ideas rather than specific story elements, and they are best used by GMs who like creating stories and rumors on the fly. Even if one of these items didn&amp;rsquo;t encourage further investigation when found, it may provide another great opportunity for a GM to create a colorful background when characters attempt to sell it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unless an item gives a specific value, these items are worthless (or if the GM prefers worth 1 cp) or valued at 10 gp. While in most cases it should be obvious whether an item is a minor valuable or essentially junk, ultimately it&amp;rsquo;s left as an exercise for the GM to decide which is which &amp;ndash; while mithral shards may be valuable in one campaign and a rat jawbone worthless, it would not be difficult to conceive of an economy that reverses those valuations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
