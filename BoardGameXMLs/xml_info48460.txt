							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Orlando Furioso: Il gioco di ruolo dei Paladini di Re Carlo</name>
									
			<description>In this very steamlined fantasy RPG, all player are Paladins, Moorish warriors and other characters of the Renaissance poems about King Charlemagne. The system is the same &amp;quot;Qui comincia l'avventura&amp;quot; that already appeared in Mediterraneo. Some special rules have been added to suit the specific setting as the one for combat on horse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The literary setting has been choosed since the first publisher has been the Biblioteca Centrale dei Ragazzi, the Kids' Library of the Rome City Council: So the setting can appeal librarians, teachers and parents. But players too, since the game contains all the ingredients of the most classic epic fantasy: Heroic knights, wizards, monsters, magic items and so on. The tone is fantastic and lightly humorous, as in Ariosto's poem: paradoxes are even present in the adventures, as sometime where in the literary world of the Italian poet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the second edition, aimed to players - both experts and beginners. It include all the previously released rules and a few new sections, as rules about magic and magic items, and a humorous sourcebook &amp;quot;Il mondo dell'Orlando Furioso spiegato ai cavalieri che intendano avventurarvisi&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;The world of Orlando Furioso explained to the kingts that plan to venture there&amp;quot;) details all the fantastic places described in the poem. It features an enlarged bestiary and the same adventure &amp;quot;La pazienza di Re Carlo&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;The patience of King Charles&amp;quot;) that was already in the first edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
