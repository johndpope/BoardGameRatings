			<description>Conquest Tactics: Inferno includes forty new cards, encompassing all of the different card types in the Conquest Tactics base game, with five copies of every Troop, three of every Spell and Skill, two of every Base, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These cards give certain factions access to spell and skill types that they've never been able to use before, gives other factions new mechanisms that reinforce their existing strategies, and expands on each factions' existing upgrade trees for troops, in addition to including victory conditions and bases that allow for new strategies and new cross-faction deck combinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kickstarter for this expansion ended unsuccessfully on September 1, 2012, and it was not released. The developers stated a continued interest in releasing this expansion in June 2013, but there has been no further news.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
