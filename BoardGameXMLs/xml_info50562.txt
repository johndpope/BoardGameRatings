							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Phantastical Phantasmagorical Montie Haul Dungeon</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the flakiest dungeon in the world, the Pyramid of Pallapot the Peripatetic. Here the intrepid party of adventurers will find incredibly confusing conundrums, intensely silly situations, indubitably terpsichorean treasures, inappreciably morose monsters, and inadvertently funny fantasy. Any party which manages to emerge from this dungeon with more than a bare fragment of their collective sanity remaining didn't take up the challenge of the adventure in the first place. This is truly one of the worst pieces of nonsense ever propounded as a dungeon adventure, but it is also one of the most amusing tricks that a GM can pull upon his players. Comic relief for all... but don't say we didn't warn you!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
