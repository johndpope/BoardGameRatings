							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arabia</name>
									
			<description>A simple boardgame of high adventure in the mysterious lands of Arabia. The game is played on a square track with 10 spaces per side (for a total of 36 spaces) with the corners designated as Baghdad, Mecca, Medina, and the Silk Road. All other spaces are empty and large enough to hold one of the Adventure Cards. The Adventure Deck and discard pile sit in the center of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players travel around the board acquiring treasures (and trying to steal them from other players). The players also face challenges. If a player fails a challenge, the Challenge Card is placed on the space the player occupies and any player landing on the card must confront the challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player is required to draw a card but there are no cards left in the Adventure Deck. Victory is determined based on the acquisition of Fortune, Fame, and Faith points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
