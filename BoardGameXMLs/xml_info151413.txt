							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Becoming: A Game of Heroism and Sacrifice</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Becoming is a game about heroism and sacrifice. It&amp;rsquo;s about what it takes to be a hero, what you have to give up in order to save the people important to you, and the home you have to leave behind. It&amp;rsquo;s about making hard choices in the face of relentless adversity, and it&amp;rsquo;s about giving up pieces of yourself in order to make sure you succeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Becoming, one player takes on the role of the Hero: an individual marked by destiny or the will of the people or some other form of greatness, sent out into the world to do dangerous things in order to save people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other players take on the roles of the Fates: intangible, conceptual forces of malice and adversity, bent on taking everything from the Hero, maybe even making her become a villain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hero goes on a Quest, and the Fates provide obstacles and conflict, as well hard bargains that the Hero must sometimes accept in order to push on. Sometimes those bargains cost her a lot, but what they cost her is usually more palatable than what she&amp;rsquo;ll lose if she falters.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
