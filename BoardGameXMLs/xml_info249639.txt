			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your boots scrape off the bloodstained flagstones as you step into hall. Fluted columns rise to support a arched ceiling lost in the shadows. A scrape of leather on stone and a jangle of mail echoes off the walls as a mail-clad skeleton steps out from behind a column.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go in search of the Eye of the Griffon in this new Adventure Module series. Based on the Old School Adventure, A1 The Oracle of Basylthor, to save the village of Wardstone the characters go in search of the Eye of the Griffon, but the location of the Eye is unknown and only the Oracle of Basylthor may know the location. The shrine of the oracle is no longer a safe place and the characters must face the dangers that lurk there if the village of Warstone is going to be saved. This Adventure Module includes introductory material, an Adventure Record and 9 Adventure cards, 9 Encounter cards, 9 Event cards, 9 Search cards and 18 Treasure cards. The adventure continues in The Tomb of Azar Mor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
