			<description>From the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge Illuminates uses the Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry rule set and is the first in the One-Shot Adventure Series. These adventures are designed to be completed in a single session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure will be challenging for first and second level characters. Total levels of the party should not exceed eight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I originally wrote this as an introduction adventure to provide my players with a starting point for the campaign. I wanted a short adventure that allowed players to test their characters and flex their dungeon delving skills. It had been a long time since we&amp;rsquo;d gone through an old fashion dungeon crawl. Another purpose of this adventure was to provide the players with a few more coins to upgrade their equipment, but much of the treasure, as the GM will discover, is not the loose coins the players will find. Lastly, the players could chose to clear out and repair the workshop to use as a base of operations. We know how players like to have their own clubhouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are skill challenges included. If you are a GM who loathes skill checks, ignore them. Black them out if they offend. The skill rolls are denoted by difficulty level (DL) with a target number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lastly, the obligatory statement, the GM should alter any part of the adventure to suit his needs. Enjoy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
