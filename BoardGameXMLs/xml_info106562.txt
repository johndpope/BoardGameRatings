							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">10 Fantasy Coins</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gold piece. Copper piece. Gold piece. Gold piece. Yawn. Silver piece. So how much did we get?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gold and silver coins in the common currency of the realm have their place. But isn't it nice to spice things up every once in a while? Presenting ten unique (and very pretty) coins to throw into your treasure hoards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trade your common gold for Ariac Leonins or a handful of bronze 5-Tov pieces. Find Copper Dragons in ancient treasure hoards, or haggle over how much your Kefish Greenshells are worth. Receive a Golden Frog from the hand of the emperor himself, or sigh in relief at the familiar denominations of Teric. Each coin has a description, value conversions, and a printable page full of front and back images of the coin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of these coins were randomly generated with the Treasure Hoard Generator Pack. The only change was a little bit of resizing here and there. The Treasure Hoard puts a nigh-infinite number of coins within your reach, plus some cool text-based generators to describe the other loot you get.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
