							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lootin&#039; Wizards: Quick Change</name>
									
			<description>After the death of the beloved Royal Mage of the kingdom, the king of the land set out a challenge to find his replacement. Wizards from far and wide came to vie for the position. Not all of them were kind and happy wizards, but the old royal mage made sure to leave some nasty tricks behind just for them. Traps and curses of all kinds were left strewn about his hiding places, now being plundered by the wizards seeking to replace him. Will they survive to claim the prize?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lootin' Wizards: Quick Change is the second, and much anticipated, expansion for the group card/board game where you race around trying to get more loot than your opponents. Now, you can you make spells to actually alter the reality of the world your wizard is racing through. This crazy expansion introduces new Markers to place on the board (changing the very face of the map), the ability to play with up to two more players in a game (up to 8 when used with the basic game), and a great mix of new Spell and Loot cards to add to the mix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
