			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nighttime, in the woods, on an earth much like yours. Crickets chirp and frogs let out a swarm of mating calls; not far off, dogs bark and the sound of garbage cans clattering against each other ripples through the night, then fades. A Nearby trailer park holds humans, sleeping or staying up into the night; not far off, the city's downtown is surprisingly still; and just over yonder, on the far side of a rusting chain-link fence, an empty warehouse rots on the shoreline, hulking in silhouetted profile. And then, a flash of light, a screech of sound, and then the immense sounds of girders bending and sheet metal shrieking to the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And again, Silence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The light that briefly appeared has faded. From the nearby streetlamp, a gaping hole and skeleton of twisted I-beams is all that remains of the warehouse's port side. Dogs bark loudly in the distance, as if challenged, until finding something else to frighten; a single cat hisses and skitters away. The City moves on, uninterested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And then, there they are. Figures, crawling out of the hole in the warehouse, Six in all. They are small and slight, moving slowly as if to avoid attention, sometimes on all fours, spreading slowly through the dockyard. The sounds of jittery voices echoes away from them, accompanied by the occasional yelp, snort, or peal of chortling laughter. They shove each other, grab at and swipe, and cajole as they group up and move about. They move further and further away, rifling through scrap piles and pulling apart old machinery, only occaisionally hurting themselves in the process. The City looms before them, only half asleep, with it's own mysteries lurking within it's borders. The figures are undaunted, or at least motivated to enter. It's out there, somewhere - the tools they need, the resources they require. They reach the chainlink fence and begin to climb; from the light of the streetlamp on the other side, pink noses at the ends of thin grey snouts peek out from under hoods and helmets; fuzzy, claw-tipped paws deftly slip around metal as they sneak into the city, unnoticed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They're here, searching through garages, sneaking through parks, evading the police. They're in the streets, the alleyways, the buildings... and maybe even Your Own Backyard! They're...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Possum Crew&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
