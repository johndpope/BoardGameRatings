			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cash In on the Mysterious Magic of Currency!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coins have a special sort of magic all their own. They are the scales by which the value of all things are measured, and yet they, themselves, have value only because society accepts that they do. The images and words stamped on coins can tell us a great deal about where and when they came from, and they capture and preserve the images of kings, sages, and other great figures, who might otherwise have been lost to the mists of time. They are a convenient window into the realms of the fates, as all can hinge on the flip of a coin. Perhaps most important of all, they are everywhere, and they are something that common man and adventurer alike often take for granted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book mints 15 brand new spells that explore these magical aspects of coins, and others. From simple and common cantrips to powerful 9th-level spells, no magic is too small or too great for the magnificent coin. Inside this book you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Powerful traps that can be laid on a coin, which can do great harm to anyone that has the coin in her possession.&lt;br/&gt;    A spell that allows you to preserve your spirit within a coin, providing a potential reprieve from death.&lt;br/&gt;    A spell that allows you to gamble great amounts of magical power on a single coin flip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...and much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
