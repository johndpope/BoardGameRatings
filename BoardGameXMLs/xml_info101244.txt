			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first game in the Lolo Series, named after the evil land the monsters are from.  The game plays the same as the rest of the series, although some of the recurring monsters do not appear.  The goal of each level is to gather all of the Diamond Framers and exit the room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been regarded as the easiest game in the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although a Japanese release, the lack of text in the puzzles makes it playable even if you cannot read.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
