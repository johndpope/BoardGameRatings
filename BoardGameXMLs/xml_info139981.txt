			<description>Website blurb:&lt;br/&gt; Legs is a modern-day Scenario for 4 to 6 Investigators which can usually be run in a single gaming session. The Investigators should already know one-another. Feel free to use the pre-generated Characters included, or have Players create their own characters. Given the nature of this Scenario, experienced Players may find it enjoyable to create themselves as Characters but this is in no way required. Keepers should feel free to adapt the location or other details of the Scenario as desired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Investigators have come to Chicago, Illinois to attend a three-day convention in celebration of their favorite weird-fiction author, Harrison Paul Likenstuff. The convention is being held in the Winding Hotel, a large somewhat upscale business hotel located near O&amp;rsquo;Hare International Airport in Chicago. The weekend consists of sessions discussing Likenstuff&amp;rsquo;s work, games based on the characters and monsters created by Likenstuff in his stories, and the highlight of the convention is a film festival of fan-created shorts inspired by Likestuff&amp;rsquo;s work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After two full days of a fun and exciting convention, the Investigators will attend the screening of a highly-anticipated fan film called Legs. But what has been a harmless and enjoyable weekend getaway quickly turns into a terrifying race to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An updated version for 7E is available: Legs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
