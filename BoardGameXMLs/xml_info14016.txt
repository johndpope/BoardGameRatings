							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Curse of Tutankhamun</name>
									
			<description>This small-press game was sold in conjunction with the exhibition of King Tut's treasures that toured the United States in the 1970's. Packaged in a cardboard tube, the game consisted of a laminated mapsheet, six colored pawns, a set of cards, and a die. The object is to be the first player to explore the tomb of Tutankhamun. As described by the publisher, &amp;quot;the game is one of twists of fate, some skillful play, and amusing excitement.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Prince and The Pirate Co. is listed as a &amp;quot;P.J. Bennett Enterprise&amp;quot; - possibly the designer?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
