			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue is packed with many great features for the 4C System, including several spy-type gadgets, and cybernetic and espionage NPCs, We introduce COMBAT, an organization that wages an invisible war against terrorism, and organized crime. You get the first half of &amp;ldquo;Opening Night at the Palace,&amp;rdquo; a short piece of fiction which follows a group of battle-hardened mercenaries on their latest tour of duty. Follow that up with the gear used in the story statted up for D6 Space, as well as new character templates based on the characters in the story! Next we traipse into the wastes of a Mutant Future, and encounter three new mutants, each with a nasty surprise for the unwary adventurer. You might also pick up a new mental mutation while exploring those old ruins of the ancients! You&amp;rsquo;ll also discover new rules variants for the 4C System by Curt Meyer, and this issue&amp;rsquo;s In Review column gives you information on not one, but two products from Vigilance Press; The World Metahuman Factbook: Germany, by Charles Rice, and The World Metahuman Factbook: Australia, by Bill Browne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
