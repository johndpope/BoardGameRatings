							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dino-Pirates of Ninja Island Basic Game (Revised Old School Hack version)</name>
									
			<description>from the designer's announcement:&lt;br/&gt;An all-NEW version of the DINO-PIRATES OF NINJA ISLAND roleplaying game! And it's free!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is based on (well, actually, just kind of copied almost wholesale from) the tremendous Old School Hack game by Kirin Robinson. It's super-simple, and designed for running off the top of your head, with very little prep required. The full rules are posted on the DINO-PIRATES website, and are available for you to copy and reproduce any way you like, under a Creative Commons license. We've created a great downloadable PDF that turns into a bunch of handy-at-the-table miniature rulebooks, as well as the class and character sheets needed for Old School Hack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment:&lt;br/&gt;This version of the DPoNI OSH rules features some notes about the setting and some guides in pocketmod format: A GM's Guide, Beasties &amp;amp; Bad Guys, Inspiration!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
