			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;20 Road encounters featuring Couriers and Messengers is an encounter with a Courier/Messenger spun 20 ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Option 21. The party comes upon a courier; he is worn out and bloodied. He tells the characters that he set out from town the other day and was set upon by demons. The creatures have dogged his steps and not let him sleep, constantly attacking him. He asks, no, begs the characters for help in the name of the king as loyal subjects. If the characters are not subjects then he will try to appeal to their kind natures to help him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The courier is being plagues by a Night Hag that wishes to kill him, the creature can only appear at night and has been toying with him, and tonight it intends to finish him off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
