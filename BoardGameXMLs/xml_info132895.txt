							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prawn 3</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uses the same rules and mechanics as PRAWN, but is in an entirely different setting with its own timeline. Includes 20 all new characters loosely based on characters from the Brassy's Men Campaign. PRAWN 3 is a complete standalone game, and you don't need to be familiar with &amp;quot;Brassy's Men&amp;quot; to run or play it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a random collection of notes for PRAWN 3. It does not explain how to run a PRAWN game or the combat mechanics. Those are in PRAWN 1 and readily available there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Many pieces of flotsam. They are listed as parts in the packet stuffing list below. There are 142 points worth of parts stuffed into character packets. You should have about 20-30 more points worth of flotsam available to throw into the pool as needed (and as stashes).&lt;br/&gt;     Hit Points. We use gummy bracelets now instead of keychains. There are 148 hit points in the game.&lt;br/&gt;     Bottles of alcohol. We suggest those plastic &amp;ldquo;airline&amp;rdquo; bottles filled with potable water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
