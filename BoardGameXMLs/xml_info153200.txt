							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lucien&#039;s Guide to the Grand Stair</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement will be a toolbox to help GMs and Players use the Warden of the Grand Stair power in their game. This product will address questions about the power, give expanded tips on GMing the power, and suggest cool things to do with the power. We also want to include OPTIONAL 'advanced' or 'exalted' versions of the power. With any expansion of powers, we will list which of the LoG&amp;amp;S NPCs would have it, so GMs choosing to be 'canonical' can do so. We would also include adventure seeds that spring from this focus and a new threat created by this Option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When possible this will be written in a first person narrative as if it was from Lucien's Point of View as if he were actually writing a guide to the use of the powers, game mechanics of course would not be written in first person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
