			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a text adventure written by Nick Montfort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your pager tickles you awake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upstairs in the house of your childhood, in your room, and it must be time for school because -- no, it's the weekend, you remember, but your alarm is going off anyway. You should have been awake already. You're going to miss the bus. Your mother climbs in the window. You're dreaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're a grown-up: It opens to you again, a sluggish window summoned by a mouse click. Waking up now in your own apartment, your new apartment. Your pager is buzzing and vibrating both, serious. It is in fact the weekend, but you're not in elementary school. No one is crawling in through the window. You're a system administrator for nWare. Waking up urgently, here in nTopia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
