			<description>A Game of Improbable Occurrences...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter a Realm where Anime and Reality Unite...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction...&lt;br/&gt;You are the president of a grossly huge anime producing MegaCorp, and as the president of a grossly huge anime producing MegaCorp, you feel it is your duty to decimate the other grossly huge anime producing MegaCorps.  To do this, you are employing the best animators (as well as the cheapest) you can find.  These animators churn out image after image, but with one problem.  They don't have a script!  Luckily the inventors working (slaving) for you have developed the first and only Anime Plotting Device(TM).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the characters of your various anime are added to your highly advanced, computerized environment, they appear in a fully constructed three-dimensional holographic matrix, awaiting your every whim!  Unfortunately, this same system was also sold to your competitors (Your poor scientists were immediately executed, of course), and you are now forced (by contract, naturally) to share the warehouse-sized holographic matrix with your sworn enemies...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being the sleazy MegaCorp president that you are, you decide to sabotage your competitor by slipping strange plots into their episodes, as well as trying to advertise your own shows by adding your characters in to kick some anime butt.  Your competitors waste no time in retaliating.  Soon, a malfunction in the Anime Plotting Device(TM) leads to a startling discovery:  the anime has become tangible, physical.  The anime is real!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Desperately, both you and your competitors hire insanely overpriced engineers to fix the problem.  The characters themselves, luckily, do not realize that they are real, and continue to do your bidding.  They still appear in the matrix as normal - through the scanning of the animators drawings.  They just do real property damage now.  Your competitors, never to be out done, do the same.  In a fit of desperation, you find yourself forced to bring occasional live humans into the unstable matrix to help, fight, and eventually to die.  They die only because, once something has entered the matrix, it's in there until it's dead.  Your best director found this out a little late for your liking.  After tangling with a 20mm anti-tank cannon wielding BU-11 Model Combat Boomer with a troubled past, he became but a memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game...&lt;br/&gt;Anime Madness(TM) is a game for two or more players, with plenty of room for house variants.  The object of Anime Madness(TM) is to become the reigning MegaCorp by doing one of two things.  You may either drive your opponent from 20 Ratings Points down to 0, becoming the only thing on television, or you may raise your Ratings Points up to 40, becoming the coolest thing on television.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
