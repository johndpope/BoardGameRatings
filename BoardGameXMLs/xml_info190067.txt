							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scavenge: Guide to the Galaxy</name>
									
			<description>The future is an unforgiving place, but you've got a ship, there's plenty of debris to salvage, and that's worth something.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scavenge is a resource-gathering, space-exploring, alien-fighting, randomly-generated board game. Take on the role of a simple scavenger, scrapping derelict ships and taking any job, just trying to get by in a less than ideal future where humanity has spread throughout the stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Scavenge, players cooperatively explore wrecked ships and abandoned or overrun planet-side facilities. Each character has a specific number of Action Points per turn that all them to Attack, Explore, Scavenge, Trade or Heal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a group, the Scavengers visit the 'Job Board' and select a mission type:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Scavenge - search a ship or facility for scrap&lt;br/&gt;     Recovery - find a piece of equipment from an abandoned ship or facility&lt;br/&gt;     Rescue - locate a captive and safely return them to your ship&lt;br/&gt;     Eradicate - clear a ship or facility of all enemies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each mission type will have a number of varied quests that will have unique mission set-up's as well as mission successes and mission fail's that will impact your Scavenger through the Campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
