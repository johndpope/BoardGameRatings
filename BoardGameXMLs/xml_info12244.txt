			<description>Word Trek: An Adventure from Start to Finish!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by Lewis Carroll&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the creators of Tangoes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains two decks of cards in a plastic case (VHS-like, but smaller). Provides 216 word puzzles and solutions. Can be played solo as a puzzle, or with groups (parties, travel -- &amp;quot;Word Trek makes a family trip fun!&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Word Trek Puzzle is a pair of words with the same number of letters (For Example: dog / cat). The objective is to transform one word into another word, through step-by-step transformations. Using paper and pencil, players either change or rearrange (anagramming) one letter from the first word to make another valid word. (For Example: dog, dot, cot, cat.) WORD TREK develops logical thinking while building vocabulary and improving spelling skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
