			<description>From the first paragraph of the instructions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Chesstique is a fun strategy game for 2-6 players of almost any age. It has its roots in the classic game of Chess, but don't let that fool you. This game feels and plays differently than other chess-based games you may have played. The rules are easy to learn, [and] you can be playing in a matter of minutes. Mastering Chesstique's new and complex strategies will be a challenge.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pieces are nicely finished, hand-stamped wooden cubes with traditional chess symbols on five of the six faces. 'Chesstique comes with a nice cloth board in a matching cloth drawstring bag and one double-sided page of instructions. Winning is based upon victory points earned by taking opposing pieces, and several interesting variants are provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
