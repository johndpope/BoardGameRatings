							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Historical: War of 3039</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;On 20 August 3028, Hanse Davion of the Federated Suns launched the most successful Succession War in history. His goal was to simultaneously capture half of the Capellan Confederation, which would sideline the power of House Liao for decades, and launch a union that would lead to the formation of the largest, strongest interstellar power since the original Star League: the Federated Commonwealth. But the Fox was not content with his success, and a scant decade later moved to crush his age-old enemy, House Kurita. In April 3039, forces of Houses Davion and Steiner moved to slay an apparently weakened Dragon - only to face a fury of teeth and claws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first in a new series, the Historical: War of 3039 campaign sourcebook details the action involving every line unit in this pivotal war. Wave maps and full regiment listings convey additional details, while amply campaign rules provide a framework allowing players to replay every laser shot and autocannon blast.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
