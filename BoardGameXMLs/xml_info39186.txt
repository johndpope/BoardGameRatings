							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tortise &amp; Hare</name>
									
			<description>Torrise &amp;amp; Hare is a racing game that uses two decks of standard cards. The goal is to reach 100 pts. There is an interesting mechanic in this game that involves rewarding the attempt to race for shorter stretches and shorter leading margins instead of attempting to obtain large margins over opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This card game is featured in the December, 2008 issue of GAMES magazine on page 88 and is part of the series &amp;quot;new card games according to Doyle.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
