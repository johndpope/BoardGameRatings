							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Interesting Inns</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The party enters an inn. Now the players will probably be expecting one of two things: finding clues to advance the plot, or a chance to rest and renew resources. It&amp;rsquo;s all good and well, but sometimes these things are done with one or two dice rolls, just so we can get out of the inn and back into the &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; adventure. The inn is usually thought of as a place that provide a few needed services for the rest of the story, not as a part of the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In case you&amp;rsquo;d like to do a bit more with your inns &amp;ndash; or if you need to fill in a few minutes at the start or the end of the session, while the party is in an inn &amp;ndash; here are a few suggestions for interesting inns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
