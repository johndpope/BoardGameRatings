			<description>There are four animals; a lion, an elephant, a hippo and a giraffe; and in between the four there is a round field. The animals are trying to defend their own goals as the balls are swinging around the field. If you're able to defend your goal for a round you get a banana. The first player to collect four bananas is the winner. You can add a monkey referee to the game to make it more complex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
