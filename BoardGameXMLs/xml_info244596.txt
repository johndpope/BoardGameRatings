							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cloud Mine</name>
									
			<description>I still remember the afternoons spent on a hill, looking at the sky while daydreaming: we stretched our hands, imagining ourself able to grab those clouds of cotton that were flying fast up in the sky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you wanna play a game? I choose my cloud and I show it to Anna as the others keep their eyes closed. Do not peek, huh? Anna, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to tell the others what the cloud looks like, but you have to be careful about what you say: if the description is too easy, they&amp;rsquo;ll guess it immediately; however, if no one guesses, I win! The best thing for you is to make the others guess my cloud with more attempts as possible. So let&amp;rsquo;s try! I have already picked my cloud&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cloud Mine&amp;trade; is an amazing game for 3-8 cloud catchers aged 8+. The box contains 80 Cloud cards, which are made to inspire your most wacky interpretations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
