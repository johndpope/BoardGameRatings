			<description>Journey of Existence is a three to five player card game in which players journey through a world filled with dreamy art. Each choice a player makes affects them as the game proceeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Features of the Game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Friendly Player Interaction: Journey of Existence is a bit friendlier than most games of its type as there are no discarding or stealing mechanics. It isn't free from all chaos however as its main mechanics of sharing and passing valuable cards around can be just as scary. Strategic players will usually win the game by planning out what cards to pass and which to keep once the inevitable passing happens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Replay-ability: Journey of Existence is a game that has so many combinations of card plays that every game experience is unique. The core game mechanics, victory point combination possibilities, and card passing theme ensure that every game is different from the last.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Journey Goals: The game revolves around the theme of Journeying through your Existence by picking up Life Traits important to your style of play. Depending on the type of Journey you decide to have and how it relates to the other players will decide the outcome of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life Actions: In Journey of Existence your time is limited. Each turn provides 4 Life Actions which can be used to do a variety of things. To do well you will need to balance your plays and keep a close eye on what other players have done in their Journeys so that you can win the Journey Goal Cards at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
