			<description>An modern horror rpg-- this edition makes changes to streamline play and better allow new players entry into the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;On the Dark Street's of the 1990's: Evil waits for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are an agent of the most secret agency ever created by the US government. Bureau 13 is an elite group of &amp;quot;Free Agents&amp;quot; who hunt the highly destructive forms of the Supernatural. You are equipped with modern and special equipment, the best in weapons and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stalking the Night Fantastic- it is the 1990's. You are the hunter of Evil. You are also the hunted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;In the early 1860's, the government of the United States established a secret supernatural investigative agency under the cover of the Civil War. Only a few top officials knew of its existence and it became known simply as &amp;quot;Bureau 13.&amp;quot; For the next century, the few employees of the Bureau went quietly about their &amp;quot;business&amp;quot; of secretly ferreting out and eliminating the destructive aspects of the supernatural.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So successful were their efforts that the memories of the public dimmed and the fear of the unknown was replaced by awe (and suppressed fear) of the new technologies. Foreign branches of the organization were established in Europe, Africa, and Asia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The years have passed and worldwide memories have failed. The public has come to believe that magic and the supernatural are the stuff of children's dreams and nightmares. They are wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bureau 13, now an ultramodern force, more secret than before, fights to stem the growth of ancient magic and the supernatural that threatens the innocent. Wherever the supernatural waits, good and evil, the agents of Bureau 13 will be there but...Evil is growing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
