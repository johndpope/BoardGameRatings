			<description>Back cover text (translated):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Swop it&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;to trade&amp;quot;, and that's exactly what this game is about -- trading clothes with each other! First, let the clothes-spinner determine who you will challenge, and which item of clothing you two will exchange with each other, then the countdown begins. Let the clothes fly! The person who first succeeds at removing their piece of clothing and putting on the exchanged piece gets to go forward on the gameboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played to 23 points (with more points given out in a round if the winner finishes trading clothes before the timer runs out).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
