							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Airlock 4</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Airlock 4 is a full-color, 40 x 30 inch, floor plan of an Airlock, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;We need to scavenge some parts to fix the ship then rendez-vous back here and get off this station. Move out!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product includes an intersection and a conjunctive airlock using our Sci-Fi Floor Tiles as the floor style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product is intended for use in near and far future science fiction games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product can be used as an expansion for the Sci-Fi Floor Tiles and Deadly Missions: Sector 15. Using it with the Sci-Fi Floor Tiles, it can be used as a starting piece for the Sci-Fi Floor Tiles to build the dungeon. The three corridors in Airlock 4 can be expanded upon to make a three-pathway dungeon very easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using it with Deadly Missions Sector 15, you can use it as the starting tile of the dungeon for a different scenario. In this scenario, the group is forced to dock with a mysterious space ship as their ship has had critical malfunctions in several systems and needs parts to be repaired. Remove the Escape Pod tile. The three parts that are used to activate the Escape Pod are used to fix the character&amp;rsquo;s ship in the airlock instead, meaning they must return to the starting tile to exit after getting the three parts needed to win the scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
