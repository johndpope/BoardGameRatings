			<description>A simple game, played with 5 dice and similar in mechanics to Yahtzee, in which players get 3 chances to roll the lowest score possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each player's turn, they roll all 5 dice.  Then, they may set aside any number of those dice and roll the remaining dice a second time.  They may again set aside any number of dice and re-roll the remaining dice for a third time.  Dice you set aside previously may be re-rolled if you wish, and you may end your turn at any time if you are happy with your current roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the rolling is done, your score is the total of all dice, with a few special rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Fours are free, so you do not add those to the total.&lt;br/&gt;2. If you have four dice showing the same number (except four), you subtract that many from the total.  Five dice of that number does not count.&lt;br/&gt;3. If you roll a straight (all five dice in order sequentially), you subtract 4 from your total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played with any number of people, and plays over five rounds, or however many you wish.  At the end of the five rounds, the person with the lowest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
