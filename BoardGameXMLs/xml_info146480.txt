							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Red Tower</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This systemless horror scenario originally appeared in the No Security kickstarter. In The Red Tower, Capone&amp;rsquo;s reign has ended, and it remains to be seen how much of Chicago&amp;rsquo;s corrupt infrastructure will be dragged down with him. As two-bit criminals scramble to establish themselves in the power vacuum, the exposed corruption presents an opportunity for muckraking socialists to provoke the downtrodden into revolution. Meanwhile, the government must intervene to stop the Commies and audit the more legitimate business holdings listed in Capone&amp;rsquo;s infamous ledger. Despite their cross purposes, each faction finds itself stymied by an unknown forces. The mobsters are missing a Capo who was never swept up in the raids. A socialist reporter has never returned from his undercover assignment. And the government has to contend with a huge factory which, according to records, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t exist. Can a group of characters seperated by politics, ideology, and class cooperate long enough to surivive a terror antithetical to life itself?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
