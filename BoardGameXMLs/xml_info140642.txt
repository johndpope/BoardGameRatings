			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern criminology continues to use various methods to analyze evidence gathered from crime scenes, but a more subtle means of obtaining information is now frequently used: psychological profiling. Also called offender profiling or behavioral profiling, this investigative method is an important scientific tool that helps investigators pin point the more probable personality traits and thought patterns of an unknown subject. Based on a number of variables - such as the criminal's actions before, during, and after the crime - this tool allows those who know how to use it to sketch a rough but often surprisingly accurate psychological profile of the suspect. Such a profile can reveal possible background or past history, personality traits, mannerisms, and even the specific goals and ambitions of a subject. This five page PDF is an easy-to-integrate PC class and just the sort of thing needed for GMs to add depth to any great d20 Modern campaign world and gaming session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
