			<description>The King has called on the Adventurers of the realm to rid the land of evil.  Defeat a great Dungeon Guardian and you could gain riches beyond imagination.  Will you answer the call?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure IN! invites you and up to 4 more Adventurers to explore dungeons in the quest to find treasures and brag about your exploits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you journey you will stumble upon Encounters, cards featuring some sort of creature or hazard.  You typically must defeat at least two in order to face the Guardian of the Treasure Horde, the ultimate Encounter!  Each time an Encounter is defeated* you level up, gaining the ability to use more powerful Treasures, such as items which heal and grant special abilities, and equipment and weapons that boost your abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure IN is two games in one!  The base game is a quick, competitive Tournament through a randomly selected Dungeon.  The first Adventurer, or Adventurers, to reach and defeat the Dungeon Guardian will be victorious.  You may choose to cooperate at strategic points in the game, especially at the final Encounter where you may have to choose between winning with a friend or losing to your opponents.  To add variety, Adventure IN also includes a fully cooperative Campaign.  In the Campaign, you and the other players work together to try and beat a series of Dungeons.  Each Dungeon has a unique layout, usually requiring that you defeat several Encounters before facing the Dungeon Guardian.  This mode offers more strategy and depth, but also takes longer to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game features multiple Dungeons, various character combinations and a large variety of Treasures and other rewards that augment character abilities.  All of this giving the game excellent replay ability!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you ready to Adventure IN?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
