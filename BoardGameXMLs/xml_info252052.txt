			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a problem in Cumberton, Tennessee, a small Apalachian coal-mining town. Children are disappearing at an alarming rate. Local law enforcement is either stymied or disinterested. And then there are the strange sightings within the mines and in the surrounding hills. It's up to a group of investigators hired by the local mining company to unravel the mystery before an ancient horror is unleashed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Scales of Time is a 1920s-era Call of Cthulhu (7th Edition) adventure for three to five intrepid investigators that can be played over several sessions. Although it can be played alone r as a part of a campaign. It also serves as a prologue to a larger adventure, The Tales of the Monolith, and a collection of eldritch adventures written by Mike Nagel and collected across three volumes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
