			<description>Sverige-loppet is a bicycle racing game played in segments (or heats) from Haparanda in northern Sweden to Ystad in the south, via Stockholm and Huskvarna and a few other places. There is also penalty rounds in the form of diversions. During the race things will happen, and they are delivered in rhymes. Winner is calculated on somewhat complicated mathematical grounds. It must be considered modern for its age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game actually has a real life original race as inspiration, from which it also borrowed its name, Sverigeloppet. (Note that Aristospel calls the game Sverige-loppet (with an hyphen) while in real life (see Community Wiki section) the name was Sverigeloppet (in one word). Both means &amp;quot;The Sweden Race&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
