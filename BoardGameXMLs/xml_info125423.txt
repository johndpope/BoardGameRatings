			<description>&amp;quot;C.H.A.O.S (Combat helicopter assault operational simulator) is a multiplayer helicopter simulation game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game offers a wide range of combat helicopters for piloting and combat employment in various combat conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Helicopter is a unique aircraft able to take off and land vertically on unprepared ground, on decks of moving ships and even on roofs of buildings, hover at an altitude of 6000 meters and rapidly turn around in a horizontal plane, fly sideways and tail first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Powerful modern weapon systems, high maneuverability, sturdy armor and effective means of attack make combat helicopters an effective and intelligent weapon, indispensable in any modern military conflict. Military helicopters are designed to perform different combat missions: fire support, assault, reconnaissance, transportation, rescue and many others. The availability and composition of helicopter fleet largely determines the level of equipment of the armed forces of any country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides player's helicopter, the game includes a great number of other helicopters, sea and land military equipment controlled by a computer program (CP) or artificial intelligence (AI). They help to create a variety of combat situations. If the character created and controlled by the player successfully fulfills combat tasks, the rating of the player rises and he is promoted to the next rank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played as a standalone (offline) as well as in a multiplayer-network mode (online).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
