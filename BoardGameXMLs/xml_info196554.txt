							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zodiac 111</name>
									
			<description>Zodiac 111 is a Canasta variant using a special 111-card deck; the cards display the Sun, the Moon, the planets excluding Earth, and the signs of the zodiac, with the Aquarius cards (which come in two colors) being the most significant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is much as in Canasta but players are dealt more cards than usual (15), there are wild cards, and there are some other changes in scoring and in requirements for going out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most notable feature of the game is its large and unusual packaging; the cards, rules, and score pad were strapped into slots in a large plastic disc molded to look like the surface of the Moon, the disk was covered by a transparent plastic dome imprinted with the game's name and zodiac symbols, with this whole arrangement packaged in a lightweight cardboard box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not clear if this game was actually published or only exists in final prototype or sales sample form; one is tempted to conclude that the packaging ended up not being cost-effective. Stancraft appears to have licensed the game, but from whom is not stated; it may have appeared in other countries as Zodiac International but that is also not clear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
