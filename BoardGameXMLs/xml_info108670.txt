							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Golden Age Adventurer&#039;s Guidebook</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;Golden Age is the free, official RPG for the Golden Age online fantasy radio drama.  It takes place in an apocalyptic, fantasy future where magic is prevalant and monsters have appeared.  The game is very reminiscent of the Final Fantasy video games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the core rulebook for the RPG and describes how to play and run a Golden Age RPG game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been over four hundred years since the end of the Mana Wars, and much that was once common knowledge is now lost. Whole libraries filled with books of history have been burnt and the CORE in all but the most backwater villages has deemed magic of any kind illegal. I myself am perhaps the last remaining expert in the era before the war, and my resources have been severely reduced in light of the revelation of the Furies. Perhaps it is simply the paranoia of an old woman, but I feel the need to record what I have learnt here in this book in the light of maybe preserving what was lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
