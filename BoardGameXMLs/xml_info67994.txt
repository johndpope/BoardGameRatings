							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Belts Challenge</name>
									
			<description>Belts Challenge is a game of strategy and knowledge. In order to win, the players must combine their strategic skills with a good measure of Six Sigma knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, each player starts by receiving a card with aims and resources to be applied. The aims are linked to the improvement of the company processes. During the game, the players answer the questions correctly, the resources bet in each round are incorporated into the process and the improvement is therefore made. The players thus get more resources to be applied. If, on the other hand, they answer the questions incorrectly, the resources are wasted, which means that they do not remain in the processes and the players are not entitled to new resources. The winner is the one who first completes the three proposed objectives..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game&amp;rsquo;s players are Green Belts and Black Belts and they will have an excellent opportunity to challenge their knowledge and company management resource skills while going after a stipulated objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
