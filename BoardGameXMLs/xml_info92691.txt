			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To maintain their monopoly on the flow of information and technology across the vast reaches of space, the powerful organization known as ComStar waged a hidden war of assassination, sabotage and terrorism for more than two hundred years. Now, the Star League has been resurrected and ComStar will play a pivotal role in its continued survival... or its ultimate downfall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BattleTech Field Manual: ComStar describes the military doctrine, traditions, tactics and battle histories of ComStar's military division, the Com Guards, and the Word of Blake splinter group. This book also provides complete information on the Free Rasalhague Republic and units of the new Star League, including the Eridani Light Horse and Clan Nova Cat, plus new equipment and 'Mechs unique to ComStar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In common with the rest of the BattleTech Field Manual series, this sourcebook provides an military-focussed overview of the entity on the cover - ComStar, in this case - as well as some new rules, equipment and 'Mechs associated with that fasion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What makes the ComStar Field Manual unusual in comparison to the House and Clan Field Manuals is that it includes a lot of details on both the second Star League, and a number of entities associated with it, in addition to the Word of Blake schismatics. This allowed FASA to fold in the general updates for the Free Rasalhague Republic along with a couple of famous units associated with the old and new Star League as well as Clan Novacat, which had joined the new Star League. That makes this Field Manual more wide-ranging than the others that had published at the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sourcebook is out of print, and unlike the older BattleTech: ComStar sourcebook, it hasn't been released in an electronic form by the current license holder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
