							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cabbage Patch Kids Hide-And-Seek Game</name>
									
			<description>from the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's fun to play the Cabbage Patch Match! Just draw the top card from the deck and place it face-up in front of you. Then, slide the lever on the game unit and watch the kids rise out of the cabbage patch. Quickly--you don't have much time--find the kid who matches the kid shown on the card, and you're on your way to a win! Keep matching kids to cards until the kids go back into hiding and it's someone else's turn. The game is over when no more kids remain in the cabbage patch. Sounds easy, but you'll have to be fast to win this game! A good memory helps, too--try to remember, if you can, who's hiding where!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
