							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Armed Legion Portable</name>
									
			<description>A small, &amp;quot;postcard&amp;quot; version of Armed Legion. A game can be as small as a 4.5&amp;quot; x 4&amp;quot; area, or combine up to 3-4 of the tiny boards for something a bit bigger. Each &amp;quot;board&amp;quot; is 7x7 hexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game mechanics are broken down the the most basic of concepts, keeping faction advantages and research involved with the game. Each faction is fully functional with all units (except the Recon Plane), including the special unit for each faction. &lt;br/&gt;In order to provide the units however, each Faction is on it's own &amp;quot;card&amp;quot; along with a &amp;quot;board&amp;quot; on which to play on. So to have all factions available, all 5 cards must be printed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;cards&amp;quot; are 4x6&amp;quot;, in order to use the same Photo Center printing ability that is provided by System Vector. This insures great printing quality on good solid paper, without using any ink. At 25 cents a print, it'll only cost $1.25 to print all 5 Factions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
