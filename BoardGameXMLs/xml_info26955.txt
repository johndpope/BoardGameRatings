							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Snoopy Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The Snoopy Card Game board consists of eight popular Peanuts characters--Charlie Brown, Sally, Lucy, Schroeder, Peppermint Patty, Woodstock, Franklin and Linus. Players try to march along the paw-print path to the finish by matching cards from their hands with the characters on the board.  By collecting &amp;quot;scoring bowls&amp;quot; players move one, two, three or four spaces at a time.  Each round ends with players drawing a card from the player to their right.  Amongst the various character cards are eight &amp;quot;Snoopy Ha-Ha&amp;quot; cards which serve as dead spots in your hand since none of them can match the characters on the board.  First player to reach the finish is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
