			<description>Designer Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treehouse Dreams is a card game about imagining a giant, impossible treehouse built together by the people playing the game. Each card represents a room or feature in this treehouse, and they all contain elements of who you are and the connections between you and the other players. The game is designed to ask simple questions that can reveal the deeper (or sometimes funnier) elements of who we are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play with people you already know, but want to know better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary of play&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the length of game desired, 10-20 cards are dealt among the players and everyone arranges them into a central 'tree' shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking turns, players flip cards - revealing new rooms in the treehouse and questions for the current player or all to answer. This is a storytelling game without objective win conditions.; play continues until all the players agree that the treehouse is done or all cards on the table have been revealed and answered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
