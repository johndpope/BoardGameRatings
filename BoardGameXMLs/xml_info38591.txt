			<description>Tactical miniatures rules designed for use with plastic army men figures. The game may also be played with 15-25mm figures, or free print-and-play paper miniatures that are provided with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional equipment required for play includes a standard card deck for each player, a twelve-sided die, a yardstick, terrain features, and accessories (vehicles, cannons, pillboxes, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten historical scenarios are included, covering actions from 1939 (Poland) to 1944 (D-Day). Specific engagements covered include a British SAS jeep assault on an airfield in North Africa, a German assault on the Red October factory in Stalingrad, and the British glider assault on the Orne River bridge (Pegasus Bridge). The scenarios require a play area ranging from 3x5 to 5x9 feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Designer's Notes: This game is not so silly as it looks and sound tactics are rewarded. It lends itself surprisingly well to re-creations of small scale (or reduced scale) historical battles.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
