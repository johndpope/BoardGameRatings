			<description>Sail Ho! Boating Adventure Game MB#4915-6&lt;br/&gt;Ages 6 to 12.  Object: Sail around the Lake. Be the first home. Basically a 112 space track  from start to finish navigated by a 1 to 6 spinner. Within certain sections of the track, only a subset of spinner results lets you advance...&amp;quot;Power Boat Wake 2's and 5's to move&amp;quot; The regions are not always well defined, so I can imagine sibling arguments over whether space 15 is inside or outside the &amp;quot;Brisk Breeze 2's and 4's Double&amp;quot; zone. &lt;br/&gt;Box contains gameboard, box liner with rules and integrated spinner and four 1&amp;quot; die cut cardboard sailboats on four different colored plastic bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't expect your kids to learn anything about sailing from this game. The children in the boat on the cover art are not wearing any life vests and I seriously doubt if the little girl is really holding the jib sheet.  Looks to me as if they have it cleated and if the wake is any indication, that boat is going to capsize or broach real soon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
