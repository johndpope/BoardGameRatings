			<description>Author's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A super hero is a lot like a Squid. In its natural environment, its sleek, sleek, strong, cunning, and graceful. But when you really stop to look at them, they&amp;rsquo;re really kind of disturbing and otherworldly &amp;ndash; the implications of their abilities are like tentacles splaying out in unknown directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; who watches these powerful unlicensed vigilantes and cleans up after their rampages?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You, of course, as an agent of the Headquarters for Enforcement &amp;amp; Registration of Observed Supernatural.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of G-men and Supermen is a 24 hour game I wrote for the 1km11kt.net contest, on the topic &amp;ldquo;Power Squid&amp;rdquo;. It casts the players as government agents keeping tabs on the rising population of super-powered individuals in 1958 America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As one of the contest judges, I can&amp;rsquo;t win, but as an activity done for fun &amp;ndash; I think it came out well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on a standard deck of 54 (including jokers) playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
