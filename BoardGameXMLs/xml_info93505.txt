			<description>&amp;quot;Diese G&amp;auml;rten, diese Alleen&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;These Gardens, these Avenues&amp;quot;) has a board with 13 &amp;quot;gardens&amp;quot; groups of eight holes) and four &amp;quot;avenues&amp;quot; consisting of 24 holes (which are also part of gardens. Two avenues belong to each player). Also contained are wooden pearls and a curious large wooden block. Through each of its sides, two holes have been drilled to the other side.&lt;br/&gt;Players take turn executing seven actions. An action can mean&lt;br/&gt;- turning the block sideways (only possible on certain positions)&lt;br/&gt;- rolling the block over one edge&lt;br/&gt;- dropping a seed (pearl) into one of the holes in the block, which will then fall through into the hole below it.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to get more points than the other player. Points are awarded for having the majority in a garden (one point) or having more pearls of either color in one's own avenues (two for first place, one for second and third place, none for the last). &lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has planted his/her last seed. Now the player with most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
