			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a standard RPGA Network tournament for a team of four to six 4th-level agents (though the serial&amp;rsquo;s challenges and XP rewards are tiered so that the serial can be played by up to six agents of levels 9, 14, or 19 as well).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Living Spycraft serial is a crossover with the Stargate SG-1 universe and several events and characters derived from the series. The main &amp;ldquo;villains&amp;rdquo; presented here are the replicators, which first appear in the third season Stargate SG-1 episode, &amp;ldquo;Nemesis.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previously, in episode 3.22: &amp;ldquo;Nemesis&amp;rdquo; and 4.1: &amp;ldquo;Small Victories,&amp;rdquo; the Asgard vessel Biliskner crashed into the Pacific Ocean 400 miles off the coast of California, with both the replicators and the Stargate Command (SGC)&amp;rsquo;s Giza Stargate aboard. Several replicators survived the crash and took over the Russian submarine Blackbird. While SG-1 members dealt with the alien threat, the Russian Navy swept the ocean and secretly recovered the Stargate (believed by the Americans to be destroyed). The Russians also recovered three damaged replicators and slipped them into stasis before they could revive. Although the SGC later learned the Russians held the Giza Stargate (in episode 4.7: &amp;ldquo;Watergate&amp;rdquo;), they as yet remain unaware the Russians possess replicators as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
