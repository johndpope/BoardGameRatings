			<description>Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Major Havoc&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major Havoc (or The Adventures of Major Havoc) is an upright cabinet vector-based arcade game made by Atari in 1983.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was initially released as a dedicated cabinet in 1983 and then one year later as a conversion kit for older vector arcade games like Tempest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dedicated versions of the game used a roller control for left-right movement, while conversion kits used their native controller hardware, such as the Tempest rotary spinner knob.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also featured a &amp;quot;warp system&amp;quot; that allowed the player to skip levels and gain bonus points. The warps were activated by a Breakout clone at the bottom-right of the screen, where there would be two- or three-digit numbers. The player would have to move the joystick until the number matched the number required to warp. For example, the red warp required the number 23, so the player would move the joystick to the right or left until the first digit matched 2, then the player would click the fire button, the Breakout ball would start moving, so the player would have to play the breakout while moving the joystick to the 3 at the same time. When the player finally entered the warp code, the player would be transported to a higher level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extra lives were earned not only by achieving a certain number of points, but also by completing the Breakout mini game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
