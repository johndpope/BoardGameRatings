							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Money Madness!</name>
									
			<description>Money Madness! is a game designed to teach children the value of US coins and currency as well as arithmetic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Have fun moving around the board buying, selling and learning the value of money.  Scan your purchase through the scanner to find how much each item costs.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two ways to play the game.  Level 1 is called Shopping Cart Match.  In this game, each player has a card with a shopping card marked with circles corresponding to various coins.  Each player in turn draws a card, passes it through the &amp;quot;secret scanner&amp;quot; to determine the value and then takes that amount in play money from the &amp;quot;cash register.&amp;quot;  The coins taken are placed on the circles on the card if they can fit.  The first player to fill all his circles wins.  Players figure out which combination of coins to take in order to fill the most circles on their card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Level 2 is called Secret Shopper.  In this version of the game, players start with a set amount of money.  They then roll a die and move a pawn along a track.  Each space will instruct them to buy one or more items, buy for a friend, return a previously bought item and collect money, or lose a turn.  If an item must be bought, the player draws a card, passes it through the &amp;quot;secret scanner&amp;quot; and then pays the indicated amount back into the cash register.  Coupon spaces reduce the price of items.  Once one player reaches the end the track, the game ends and the player with the most money remaining wins.  Unlike Shopping Cart Match, there is no strategy to this version of the game, although players must be able to make change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
