			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever wondered what a weapon actually does when you strike an opponent? What part of the body was hit and what were the physical effects of the blow? These questions are ignored by most combat systems and are at best handled by &amp;quot;fixes&amp;quot; such as critical hit rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wouldn't it be nice to have a fast, simple system which accurately determines where the weapon hits and how deep it penetrates? This supplement is just that. The first and only damage system which gives the real results of a weapon blow. Not only do you know the target area hit (head, neck, body, arm, etc.) but the depth to which the weapon penetrates. Suddenly all the inaccuracies of a hit point system disappear. Critical hits, disabling injuries, broken bones, and cut arteries are all accurately, vividly portrayed. A hit no longer takes the form of vague &amp;quot;hit points&amp;quot; but is transformed into rent armor, cut flesh, and broken bones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are curious . . .&lt;br/&gt;If you are dissatisfied with your current rules . . .&lt;br/&gt;If you demand the best . . .&lt;br/&gt;Join the Revolution in Game Design and move up to the Leading Edge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
