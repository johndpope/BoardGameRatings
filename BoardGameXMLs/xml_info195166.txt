			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Torchbearer, besides being a specific game with a setting, is a simple, flexible System that can be used for many different kinds of games. The next two Chapters describe the System in its entirety. Where I have described several different rule-options, the one that the default Torchbearer game uses will be listed&lt;br/&gt;first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules set presented in this product is exceptionally difficult and recommended only for quite experience players.  Nearly every rule is optional, and most rules have a few variants.  Action resolution uses a complex mechanic based on levels of difficulty (a very simple Action Table, similar in concept to Fudge difficulty levels) compared to dice pool rolls using specialized dice (standard d6 can be used instead, however).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
