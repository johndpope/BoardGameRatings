			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Urban Decay is a collection of source material for the Metropolis Rho campaign setting as described in the adventure [Humanity In A Bottle], which depicts a degenerating society in the far future, more than two hundred years after the nuclear holocaust known as &amp;ldquo;the Fall&amp;rdquo;. Isolated from the desolate world outside by its own ancient city dome, Metropolis Rho presents an ideal Degenerate community for GMs to base new campaigns in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The material herein is intended to serve as background information for both GM and players alike, giving a history of the city, an overview of its culture and inhabitants, class divisions, and a glimpse of the elements that make it an iconic Degenerate community. In addition to &amp;ldquo;setting the stage&amp;rdquo;, Urban Decay presents guidelines for making characters from the city, including suggestions on how standard Darwin&amp;rsquo;s World occupations and even variant backgrounds can be incorporated into the setting. A number of new weapons and items are also introduced here, as well as three new advanced classes that make an appearance in the Humanity In A Bottle adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
