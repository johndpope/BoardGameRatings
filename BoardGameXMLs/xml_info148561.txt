							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crimson Reunion</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs are all members of the same graduating class, all returned for their 10th year reunion. The scenario begins with the arrival of the PCs who are all staying at the same hotel while visiting town. The organizers thought it would be more fun if everyone stayed in the same place rather than bunking down with family if they have any in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Classmates have two days to arrive for the reunion, giving the early birds something to do on Thursday and the late arrivals time to show up on Saturday, the day the reunion will be held at the high school building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something horribly wrong has occurred however, and this will be a reunion drenched in blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crimson Reunion is an adventure for use with Eternal Shadows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
