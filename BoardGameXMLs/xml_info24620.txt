			<description>From Box &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A classic game played on a checker board and combining some of the choice aspects of chess, droughts, poker and bridge. yet so easy to learn everyone achieves competence sufficient for enjoyment during the first game. Accommodates 2,3 or 4 players&lt;br/&gt;at once.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to accumulate the highest score, which is not necessarily the same as capturing all of one's opponent's pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moves: Any counter or piece may be moved exactly like a chess queen however limited to the number of squares moved at a single turn by the number on its bottom. that is a counter may be moved perpendicular to the sides of the squares or along the diagonals provided there is no obstruction but limited by the number on the bottom. &lt;br/&gt;General Rule: Any piece moved more than one square on a single turn of a player must be turned and played bottom up for the remainder of the game .... capture is the same as in chess .... a players score is the sum of the numbers on the bottoms of the opposing pieces he/she has captured plus the sum of the numbers on his/her own counters remaining on the board at end.&lt;br/&gt;etc etc&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
