			<description>This game is a film quiz published by Fantoom Projecten in collaboration with the International Film Festival Rotterdam (IFFR). The game contains a game board, 792 questions in 6 categories and hosts 2 to 5 players.&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to answer questions right from each of the 6 categories, after which one final 'super' question has to be correctly answered.&lt;br/&gt;The 6 categories are: Movie History, Directors, Movie Stars, General, Tiger Questions (related to the film festival) and Brain Teasers.&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns, rolling dice and walking across a Trivial Pursuit-like game board on which the categories are represented. In addition, the board contains other icons that help you move across the board faster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
