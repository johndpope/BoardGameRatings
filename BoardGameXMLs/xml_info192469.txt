			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wizard Cops is a free RPG originally written as a demo for the ConnectiCon game design panel Cancel your Fantasy Heartbreaker: How to Actually Write that RPG. It's only a paragraph long, but it is used as an example how a very small number of rules can create very specific conflicts with controlled resolutions. People at the panel wanted to know where they could get it, so I'm putting it up for the big bad internet!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wizard Cops is a game that creates standoffs, and asks players how much they'll put on the line. And it does so with rules shorter than this description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
