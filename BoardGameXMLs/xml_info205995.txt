			<description>Spinner 10 is a card game played with 2 Special Dice (numbered 1-5 + Spinner) and 100 cards (10 cards each, 1 through 10). A game of luck won by the roll of the spinner dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A family card and dice game by the originators of Spinner Dominos.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are each dealt ten face-up cards to start. In turn, each player rolls the dice and then discards a card with the corresponding die total from their hand. A spinner counts as zero, while double spinners allows you to discard all of the cards of one value from your hand (your choice). If you roll and have no matches, you must draw a new card. When it is your turn, instead of rolling you can use the die roll of the person before you, but must roll if the previous player did not roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues (roll dice, discard if you can, draw if you can't) until one player has successfully discarded all of their cards. Everyone totals the remaining value of the cards in front of them, adds that to their own score, and a new round begins. After ten rounds, the player with the lowest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
