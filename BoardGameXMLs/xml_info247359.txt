							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paragon&#039;s Aerial Campaign Rules 1916-18</name>
									
			<description>Thin-card covered booklet of rules for a campaign game based on the Aerial Dogfight Rules 1916-18 - to be used to follow a campaign for just a single squadron v squadron or involving multiple squadrons or 'airforces'.  It uses map movement for aircraft until combat occurs or an objective is reached where individual aircraft (presumes scale models but could use counters) then are placed on a table for tactical play. Most of the rules are concerned with expanding the dogfight game to a multi-day campaign using maps but some are for expanding the play on a table with aircraft to include bombing, AA fire, ground attack and balloon-busting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;11 pages of rules cover squadron types and sizes, pilot experience, wounds, campaign points, heavy bomber campaigns, navigation (optional), map movement, visibility, AA, bombs, ground attack, balloon-busting, replacements and repairs, weather (optional).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rest of the booklet consists of 24 pages of aircraft charts (one aircraft per page), several sheets for orders, templates for a movement protractor, a wind indicator and counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two map sheets are loose in the centre - one small map with a simplified (made-up) version of the Western Front and a larger one with SE England and Western Germany on opposing sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
