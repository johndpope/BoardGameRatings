							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Era Report: 3062</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conflict is inevitable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For three hundred years, the nations of the Inner Sphere waged war in the name of the fallen Star League, sending armies of MechWarriors into battle for glory and power. The arrival of the Clans, martial descendants of the lost Star League Defense Force, in 3049 upset all the previous balances of power and set the stage for cataclysmic warfare to rival the worst of the Succession Wars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end of the initial Clan invasion and the new renaissance of military technologies leads the leaders of the Successor States to seek advantage against each other. The ever-present specter of the Clans urges desperation to end old feuds to make space for new ones. And the Truce of Tukayyid holds the Clans in check, but does nothing to ease the cultural pressures on both sides of the border.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Era Report: 3062 describes the state of the Inner Sphere and the Clans at a divisive period in BattleTech history: the latter years of the Clan Invasion. Presented as a general overview of the period, rather than a focused report on a single conflict, this book includes descriptions of many major Inner Sphere, Periphery, and Clan factions. Notable personalities, military forces, and an overview of the technological capabilities of the Inner Sphere and Clan powers of this critical period in history are also provided, along with special advanced-level rules for campaigns set in this era, whether played using the Total Warfare core rules or those found in A Time of War: The BattleTech RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
