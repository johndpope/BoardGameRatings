			<description>&amp;ldquo;War and politics in ancient Greece. Six and Ten sided dice are required. The Board: Use a map of the Aegean circa 430 B.C. Divide the map into spaces, either hexagonal or irregular shaped. Make sure to include cities that existed at the time. Victory: Control the most city states at the end of 36 turns.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with a home city, three leaders, ten gold, and six city traits. A city also receives two armies, two rowers, and two fleets, unless the city is landlocked in which case it just receives four armies. Each player also starts with five cards. The cards can be used as an aid in areas such as battle, diplomacy, and movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
