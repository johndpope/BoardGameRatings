							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chaos Domain</name>
									
			<description>Chaos Domain is a game about shooting bad people in the face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart from that, it is also a run and gun platformer, powered by Unreal Engine. The game is highly influenced by games from 8-bit and 16-bit era, including Contra/Probotector series, as well as titles like Abuse and Doom Troopers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set on a huge spaceship occupied by chaos cultists, where the main character (who clearly looks like a hi-tech version of the god Anubis) must kill everyone in sight. The game is obviously not story-driven, it&amp;rsquo;s all about action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can upgrade and purchase weapons and special items that can boost their performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
