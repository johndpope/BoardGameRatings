			<description>&amp;quot;Windjammers (also known as Flying Power Disc in Japan) is an arcade game released by Data East on the Neo Geo arcade system in 1994 and later on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on June 22, 2010. The game is based on an actual real world sport, called 10-S, using a flying disc. The game mechanics are essentially the same as Pong or Air Hockey; with either three or five points scored depending on where the disc hits the wall behind the opponent, or two points scored if the disc hits the ground before reaching the wall. Each sets lasts thirty seconds or ends when one player reaches 12 points. The winner of the match is the first player to win two sets. A tie gives each player credit for one win. If players are tied two matches in a row, players go to a sudden death round where the first player to score wins the match.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Windjammers (Neo Geo) , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
