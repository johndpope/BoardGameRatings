			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Evil - A Short Horror RPG attempts to create a cinematic roleplaying experience where characters represent the archetypes found in horror movies, doing the stupid (and often fatal) things that horror movie characters do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character creation is relatively simple.  Players select an Archetype (preferably from a horror movie) to model their character upon.  Characters then receive Traits which are narrative tags describing anything notable about the character--usually 5-10 Traits are selected.  Traits are given a numeric score of 1-20, optionally as high as 30 or even 40 with GM consent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action resolution is based upon traits and difficulty.  Really Easy tasks are rated at +10, Hard at -10, and Impossible at -20.  These modifiers are added to the relevant Trait and then 1d20 must score under the result for success.  Attempting an action without a relevant trait uses a separate table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
