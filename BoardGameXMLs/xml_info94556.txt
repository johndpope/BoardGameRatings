							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">2000 Miles to Paradise</name>
									
			<description>2000 Miles to Paradise is a fast paced game of auto combat. Players take on the role of scavengers trying to survive in a savage wasteland, filled only with road, sand and danger. Each has heard rumors that there is a paradise, and it&amp;rsquo;s about 2000 miles away. To get there, the player will have to face many battles, and manage their resources well enough to reach their goal. 2000 Miles to Paradise is not meant to simulate real-world physics, rather it mimics the fast paced and frantic combat found in movies like Mad Max.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vehicle customization and combat have been streamlined for fast play, yet allow players to be creative. Players start by selecting a vehicle type, then spend salvage points on various modifications. The players then assign bonus dice to sections of the vehicle to tune the attributes of their vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is then played in a series of duels, with each player fighting to drive 2000 miles to reach the rumored paradise. Each duel won gets the driver 200 miles closer, as well as gas, ammo and salvage to upgrade their car. If the scavenger loses a duel though, it's all over. Do you have what it takes to reach paradise?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
