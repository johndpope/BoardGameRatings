							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cluster Luck</name>
									
			<description>This is a press your luck game playable on a Byzantine Chessboard.  In the game, players try to cluster their pieces into groups to score more points (players score bonus points for their largest group).  players roll two dice and move around a lane, leaving a piece behind. If they land on a space they landed on prior, they end up losing all points in the round. Bonus points are awarded for forming larger groups.  Players have to decide when to quit, as is typical of a press your luck game, and failure to do so and landing on a space occupied prior results in no points earned for the round.  Players have to decide when to either quit or push forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
