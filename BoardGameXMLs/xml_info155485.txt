			<description>Reel Fishing II (known as Fish Eyes II in Japan) is the final Reel Fishing game on the PlayStation. It was published by Natsume. It features 19 levels and tons of different types of fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main menu gives an options menu, Free mode, and Season mode. The game menu is the Aqua Lodge, in which the player may view records, tackle, and a fishing magazine which gives monthly tips and news. In the tank room, the player can care for and watch caught fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay consists of a full motion video background and a point of view from the boat. The player may cast anywhere into the play area, but may not move. Some areas may have different spots with different assortments of &amp;quot;hotspots&amp;quot; and a different current.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a fish has &amp;quot;bitten,&amp;quot; the screen shifts to an 3d underwater view and the player must either entice the fish using a lure, or wait for fish to arrive using bait. The hook must be set at the right time, and the fish must be fought to the surface. At the time it reaches the surface, it is automatically brought onto the shore and size is calculated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Reel Fishing II&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
