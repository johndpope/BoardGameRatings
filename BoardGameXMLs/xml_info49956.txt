							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">RuneQuest Cities</name>
									
			<description>The Fourth Edition of the Cities supplement from Midkemia Press was brought into the Avalon Hill/Chaosium Runequest series as a generic sourcebook. This served as one of a number of AH Runequest supplements in their &amp;quot;Gateway&amp;quot; series, intended to broaden the RQ system beyond the Glorantha setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;RUNEQUEST CITIES: the natural arenas for fantasy roleplaying adventures, city events are the most interesting, city dungeons the deepest, city biways the darkest, city dangers the most invidious, city activities the most tempting, and city rewards the most fabulous.&lt;br/&gt;A unique guide to urban possibility, RQ CITIES includes clear instructions, more than 60 tables, additional dozens of sub-tables, and many illustrations and silhouettes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RUNEQUEST CITIES: Entertaining, systematic, indispensible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Challenging Encounters&lt;br/&gt;     City Populating Procedures&lt;br/&gt;     Character Catch-Up System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RUNEQUEST CITIES is a book of support tables and utilities for the RuneQuest roleplaying game, it contains hundreds of random encounters, from tipsy fools to dangerous sorcerers, as adventurers wander through town or city: turn random meetings into the seeds of new, exciting adventures. A city-populating procedure establishes logical and interesting functions for every building in your town or city. A character-catchup system accounts for what player-characters do when they are not in play for longish periods; learn what they're up to when you're not around! Adapt it to your campaign situation. RQ CITIES is tuned to a general urban fantasy background; it can be applied to any-game world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
