			<description>There's no place like home, there's no place like home... if you have Magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this spin-and-move children's game based on The Wizard of Oz movie by MGM, players race for Home. The key to winning, however, is to arrive Home with a Magic Card in hand. The board depicts colorful characters and places in Oz &amp;quot;from the MGM movie, an annual television favorite&amp;quot; to recreate Dorothy's magical trip through Oz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup: give each player a pawn and set the 4 Magic Cards on Home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is simple. Youngest player goes first. On her turn, the player spins the spinner. If the spinner points to a number, she moves her pawn that many spaces along the track:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     If the space her pawn lands on is unoccupied and has instructions for continuing the move such as to go ahead or move back a certain number of spaces, follow those instructions immediately.&lt;br/&gt;     If the space her pawn lands on is unoccupied and has an M on it, the player receives a Magic card if she doesn't already have one, or returns her magic to the pile at Home if she does.&lt;br/&gt;     If the space she lands on is already occupied (except Home - only Home may be occupied by more than one pawn), she must move her pawn back until she reaches an unoccupied space. When a player has to move back like this, any instructions on the space she moves back to are ignored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the spinner arrow points to Magic Card instead of a number, the player takes a Magic Card if she doesn't have one, or returns her Magic Card if she already has one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until someone reaches Home with a Magic Card. If a player reaches Home, but does not have a Magic Card, she can stay there, taking her turn as usual until she spins a Magic Card or another player reaches Home with a Magic Card (or without and spins one first).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There no place like Home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
