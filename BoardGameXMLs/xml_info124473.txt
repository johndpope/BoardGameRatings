			<description>Marbles? merges the exciting aspects of a party game with one-on-one challenges both observed and judged by all other players, the Peanut Gallery. Many of the challenges are reminiscent of familiar games. Others are very unique and designed specifically for the roles of Challenger, Opponent and Peanut Gallery. Marble-like gems are the currency. Players must use their intellectual marbles to win challenges and also strategically pose challenges that are to their greatest advantage. Highly dimensional, there are multiple perspectives of strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns being the Challenger and can select any player not previously an Opponent in the same round. &amp;quot;Teaser&amp;quot; cards indicate Opponent availability. Opponent cards change the dynamics of the challenge. Peanut Gallery cards permit side wagers, further expanding the dimensions of how the game is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All challenges are performed in (2) minutes or less. Challenger cards detail a wide variety of tasks across (7) categories:&lt;br/&gt;1) Consensus - The Peanut Gallery is polled to derive a count that the opponent must accurately predict. Some are factual events like visiting an ATM within the last 24 hours while others are preferences such as: Cat or Dog, Chocolate or Vanilla, Paper or Plastic&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;2) Dice - Challenger cards in this category require a specified outcome from the roll of dice. Luck over skill, the tasks vary as defined for each challenge.&lt;br/&gt;3) Domino &amp;ndash; To win, the Opponent must also hold a Challenger card in this category having a Domino number that matches one of the two numbers presented by the Challenger.&lt;br/&gt;4) Performance &amp;ndash; Opponent must skillfully complete the challenge. Examples include telling a joke that invokes laughter and an impersonation in which the Peanut Gallery must correctly guess.&lt;br/&gt;5) Physical &amp;ndash; Another skill category, the Opponent must successfully complete a task involving an activity like Origami (paper folding) or Roshambo (Rock-Paper-Scissors).  When the results are subjective, the Peanut Gallery judges the task.&lt;br/&gt;6) Playing Cards &amp;ndash; A single hand of a common card game is played, such as Blackjack or Draw Poker. Every Challenger card in this category fully defines the task and specifies the requirements necessary to win.&lt;br/&gt;7) Starter &amp;ndash; Cards in this category quickly establish the winner, simply with who holds the highest number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is simple. Take turns matching a Challenger card in hand with an opponent anticipated least likely to successfully complete the task. Opponents set the wager, either (1) or (2) marbles, upon the Challenger announcing the category. Should the Opponent fail the task, the Challenger wins the wager. Otherwise, the Opponent collects the wager.  Number of players determines the number of rounds. At game end after the final showdown (in case of a tie, if necessary), the player with the most marbles reigns supreme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not at all the game of marbles everyone played as a child, this version is all grown up but still retains the youthful retro spirit.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Wanna play Marbles?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;180 Marbles? Cards, 4 Color-Coded Types, 7 Challenger Categories&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
