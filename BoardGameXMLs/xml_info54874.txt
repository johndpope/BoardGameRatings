			<description>A chess-style game with 20 pieces per side, secret / variable set-up. 2 players, ages 8 and up. Print-n-play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Standard chessboard&lt;br/&gt;40 pieces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on E. R. Burroughs' Chessmen of Mars' (Jetan). I made a set of the original game Burroughs used as a plot device for the book and quickly discovered the design was flawed - 99% of all games ended in a draw. Not much fun. As I changed and clarified the rules to make the game competitive and fun, I soon hit upon the idea of dropping the specialized board and introducing secret set-up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No longer using the 10x10 square board, EAGLES &amp;amp; KINGS uses a standard chessboard. With 20 pieces per side, this leaves 4 pieces in the third rank. Set-up for each player is done in secret. This makes each game potentially unique, as each player can place any of his pieces anywhere within the first 3 ranks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything needed to play EAGLES &amp;amp; KINGS can be found in the files section, and permission is given by the designer for print-n-play. The piece designs and rules are my own and copyrighted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
