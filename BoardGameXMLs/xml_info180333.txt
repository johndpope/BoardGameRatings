			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Want to play a super hero RPG, but have no one around to game with, well Avalon is here to save you from your boredom.  Yep its here at lasts, a solo system for playing a comic book super hero RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything you need is supplied, the rules for running the game, battle tiles to fight the super brawls on, exciting adventures and encounters, hard choices to make which can effect the future of your hero.  Its all here, the arch-foes, the helpless old lady caught in a bank robbery, aliens and monsters, super villains and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comic Book Adventures uses Avalon&amp;rsquo;s popular Heroes Wear Masks RPG as the base for the system, which in turn is based on Pathfinder, so if you are familiar with that great RPG game engine then you are already to go.  If you have yet to play Pathfinder or Heroes Wear Masks, then here is your opportunity to jump in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So get ready, sew your costume, grab your cape and power up your energy beams, the city is in need of a hero and you must answer the call.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comic Book Adventures comes with all you need to get started, the core book offers all the rules needed to play, the charts need to discover your adventures and a Mini-Mission book full of premade adventures and encounters.  The system also comes with a record sheet, over 40 full color battle tiles and much, much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find a full set of rules for playing the game, over 40 full color battle tiles and a mini-mission book to get you started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the system is geared toward using Avalon&amp;rsquo;s Heroes Wear Masks, you can, with a bit of tinkering, use just about any RPG system, so if you want you can play using your favorite super hero RPG and have just as much fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t use the system as a solo game, there is all sort of great stuff you can use in your standard group based super hero game.  So invest in your gaming future and pick up a copy of Comic Book Adventures and soar high into the sky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
