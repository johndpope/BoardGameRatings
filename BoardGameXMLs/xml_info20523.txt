							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Animals Animal Rummy</name>
									
			<description>This game is played with a deck of 32 cards.  Each features information on a different prehistoric animal.  This information has nothing to do with gameplay, however -- all that really matters is that each card has a number from 1 through 8 in the upper left corner.  Players are trying to collect sets of four cards with the same number.  Each turn, the current player asks opponents for cards of a given number, Go Fish style.  Players are required to hand over requested cards if they have them, but as soon as a request cannot be fulfilled, a new player's turn begins.  When all cards have been played in quartets, the player with the most completed sets wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
