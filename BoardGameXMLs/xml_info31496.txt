			<description>This is an abstract game played with a chess board and Icehouse Pieces where the object is to get your pieces to the opposite corner of the board as quickly as possible.  It has some of the feel of Chinese Checkers, but with the added complications of the possibility of your opponent being able to immobilize your pieces, and you being able to carry your immobilized pieces, and movement rates and jumping restrictions based on the size of the pieces involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
