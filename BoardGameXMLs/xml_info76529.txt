			<description>Demise: Rise of the Ku'tan is a medieval fantasy role-playing video game released in 1999 for the personal computer (PC), developed by Artifact Entertainment and published by IPC Software. The game features the same setting as Mordor: The Depths of Dejenol, which was also developed by designer David Allen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Demise: Rise of the Ku'tan, Lord Gherrick's realm is attacked by demons emerging from the mines of Dejanol. After the assault is quelled, the player is dispatched into the mines in an attempt to locate and destroy the primordial evil at its centre. The game world is split between a series of towns and dungeons; the former features guilds and merchants, while the latter houses monsters, which must be destroyed during the course of the players' explorations. At the outset, users are required to create an avatar with particular racial traits, classes and starting statistics, and develop the character as they progress within the game. This development is achieved by gaining experience, measured as a statistic, and equipping improved weaponry, purchased from the traders. Furthermore, the game features up to 16 players in a co-operative multiplayer mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Demise: Rise of the Ku'tan,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
