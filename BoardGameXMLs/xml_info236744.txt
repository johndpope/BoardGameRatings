			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the lands of Dragatha, a frontier region steeped in history and conflict. Where factions struggle for power and dominance. Where the civilised races have either fallen or are struggling to retain control of the lands they claim as theirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genesis of Heroes is the first instalment of the Shadows of Knightsfall. An adventure path designed to introduce players to the lands of Dragatha. Here, in the war-weary settlement of Knightsfall, the local people are crying out for a band of brave adventurers to step forward and right the wrongs that haunt their lands. Will you have the courage to embark on such a perilous path?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for the fifth edition of what is claimed to be the world's greatest roleplaying game, this module is designed to start a group on their careers as adventurers, as they embark on a multitude of quests that will eventually take them across these dangerous lands. Included within this module:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Three full adventures for 1st- and 2nd-level characters&lt;br/&gt;    Full stat blocks for every creature encountered within the module&lt;br/&gt;    Descriptions of all magic items&lt;br/&gt;    Guidance on how to adjust the encounters for smaller and larger groups&lt;br/&gt;    A ten page creature compendium including a full write-up of all creatures in the module&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
