							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">JAWS: The Card Sharking Game</name>
									
			<description>The first ever game that actually plays out the Hunt for the Great White from JAWS (1975)! Out of the only handful of games made about JAWS since 1975, none of them have been about or represented the events from the first Jaws film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1-3 players play the Orca ship deck, 1 player plays the JAWS deck. The Orca deck wants to run the JAWS deck out of cards with various weapons, flotation barrels, a shark proof cage, strychnine, etc. During the hunt the Orca players can be expected to drink, sing, fish, work together and back stab each other. The time of day can change as the hunt progresses as well as the Orca's distance from shore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The JAWS deck wants to eat the Orca crew, consisting of Quint (Robert Shaw), Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), and Brody (Roy Scheider)! No better way to do this then by sinking the Orca first! Each deck has its own unique way of winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything that happens during the last hour of JAWS (1975) is in this game. Everything!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
