							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warfighter 101: Movement to Contact</name>
									
			<description>Components: Four pages of color rules, four operations orders, two player aids describing the units, one sheet of mounted 7/8&amp;quot; counters (not die cut) and an 11x17&amp;quot; map (double-sided).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game covers clashes at the National Training Center between a heavy battalion and an OPFOR motor rifle force.  Both sides have supporting artillery and helicopter assets attached.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanics are straightforward with both players moving and then firing - damage takes effect after combat.  Fire is resolved by rolling a handful of dice, counting the hits and then subtracting the target's armor - units may be stunned, forced to retreat, take losses or be killed outright.  The advanced rules add a sort of opportunity fire where a unit may interfere with enemy movement by declaring it as a target (provided the enemy is within a certain distance).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Operations Orders set up victory conditions and other effects (such as defensive positions) - thus, in a 2 player game, some information will not be shared between players.  A blank template for scenario creation is provided and blank forms may be downloaded from the publisher's website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
