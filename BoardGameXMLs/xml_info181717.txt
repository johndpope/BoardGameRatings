							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Headhunter</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kill monsters, take their heads, and then use their heads to trigger moves (or talk to them to reroll a botched spout lore): a gruesome circle of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you level up you can use your heads in a bunch of new ways (we managed to cram twenty-three advanced moves on the sheet): take their eyes, wear their faces, use them as ranged weapons, intimidate others, shrink them so you can carry more around, give them to Death in exchange for your own soul, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains four separate pdf files. Two are digest-sized, 20 page pdfs that includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Headhunter, a complete class with 23 (yes, twenty-three) advanced moves: gobble up brains to heal yourself, get better at butchering your foes, animate your heads so that they can help you, use them as weapons, plant them on stakes so that they can keep an eye out, and more.&lt;br/&gt;    New weapons (like a kurki and blowgun), bone armor, dungeon gear, poisons, and an artifact.&lt;br/&gt;    A director's cut that provides an explanation for some of the moves, and even some questions to ask yourself when rolling up a headhunter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
