			<description>Binary Land (バイナリィランド?) is a game developed by Hudson Soft in 1983 for the MSX, FM-7, NEC PC-6001, NEC PC-8801, and in 1985 for the Famicom. The MSX version saw release in Europe by Kuma Computers Ltd in 1984 .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player has to unite two penguins, Gurin (male) and Malon (female), who are in love. Standing in their way are spiders, birds and other creatures which the player must attack with the penguins' spray. The player controls the two penguins at once, so the challenge is to try to get them to meet at the caged heart and thus complete the level. Adding to the difficulty is a timer, and the fact that the penguins move mirror images of each other. The game features many different stages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The background music in the game is the melody of the song &amp;quot;Je te veux&amp;quot; by Erik Satie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Binary Land&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
