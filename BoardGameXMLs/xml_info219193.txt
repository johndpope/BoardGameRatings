			<description>The midnight hour has arrived, and the ghosts are now pressing their noses against the window &amp;mdash; but they're scared of their own shadows, so who can find the right shadow to drive them to flight?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn in Ghost Catchers (a.k.a. Gespenster am Fenster), one of the ghosts arrives at the window, and players compete to find the proper shadow for this ghost to scare it away. Whoever thinks they have the right shape, places the transparent card on the ghost and if they're correct, the ghost flees and the player scores. The shadows are all similar, however, and you can try to scare each ghost only once, so look carefully!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can played with children from age 4-1/2 and up, with the number of ghosts in play being adjusted to make the game more difficult for older players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
