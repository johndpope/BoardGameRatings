			<description>The object of the game is for a player or team of players to line up five chips in a row on the board to form a &amp;quot;run&amp;quot;. The first player or team to create two runs wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Play: A player begins his turn by rolling all five dice. The combination of the dice facing up is to be read like cards in a poker hand. Viable hands include full house, straight, five of a kind, four of a kind, three of a kind, two pairs and one pair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player may throw the dice once, twice or up to three times to roll the best possible combination. After their first roll, a player can roll again anything from one to five of the dice. On your second and third rolls you can again roll one to five of the dice, including re-rolling anything you had set aside in the first roll.  After the third roll place a poker chip of your team color on the board that corresponds to the poker hand combination of dice. Then the next player to the left rolls the five dice to start their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the squares of the board corresponding to the dice combination rolled is already covered by a chip, then that player's turn is over and they cannot play a chip on the game board. Note: there are usually two of each possible combination on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player or team places five chips in a row on the board this constitutes a run. Chips in a run are protected during the remainder of the game. A player's run may share common chips with their other runs, however, a player cannot claim a new run by adding chips to the end of an established run. A new run must contain at least 4 chips not in common with the original run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player or team to create two runs on the board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Rules:&lt;br/&gt;The center square on the game board that can be used by all players as part of a run, but cannot be claimed by any one player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lucky 7: Anytime a player rolls a combination of the five dice so that the face value adds up to seven a player has the option to place a chip on either Luck 7 or whatever other combination appears on the dice (full house, three of a kind, etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lucky 11: Anytime a player rolls a combination of the five dice so that the face value adds up to eleven a player has the option to place a chip on either Luck 11 or whatever other combination appears on the dice (full house, three of a kind, etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five of a Kind: Anytime a player rolls a five of a kind that player may place their chip on ANY open square on the game board.  Wild!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bouncer: After all the &amp;quot;straight&amp;quot; squares on the game board are filled, every time you roll another straight the results is a &amp;quot;bouncer&amp;quot;. A bouncer allows the player to remove any one opponents chip from game board except a chip that has been placed in an already  completed run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all the &amp;quot;full house&amp;quot; squares on the game board are filled, every time you roll another straight the results is a &amp;quot;bouncer&amp;quot;. A bouncer allows the player to remove any one opponents chip from game board except a chip that has been placed in an already  completed run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
