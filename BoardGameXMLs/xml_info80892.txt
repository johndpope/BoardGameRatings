							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battleground 2: Gettysburg</name>
									
			<description>Battleground 2: Gettysburg is a turn-based strategy computer game developed by TalonSoft in 1995. It simulated combat at the 1863 Battle of Gettysburg, using both a video version of miniature wargaming and board gaming. Terrain hex maps are 3D or 2D with various scales and sizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic platform for the Battleground series involves individual infantry and cavalry regiments, artillery batteries, and commanders. All are rated for strength, firepower, weaponry, morale, and movement. As a unit takes fire, it may become fatigued, disordered, or routed to the rear. Players compete against the computer's artificial intelligence or against another player via modem. Players may try a variety of 25 individual scenarios, or refight the entire Battle of Gettysburg. A Fog of War option enhances playing against the computer, as it hides units that are not in direct view of the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features video clips of battle reenactments, as well as Civil War music by folk singer Bobby Horton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Battleground 2: Gettysburg&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
