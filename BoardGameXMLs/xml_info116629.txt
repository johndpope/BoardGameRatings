							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horse Race Game</name>
									
			<description>Promotional game, published by Milton Bradley, but for Coca-Cola.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has six lanes, each numbered. To move a horse, throw three dice. The three numbers on the dice means that those three horses move forward one space. Of course, if the same number is rolled on two of the dice, that horse moves forward two spaces. Treat three of the same number accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crossing the finish line is a little different for this game. If a horse is one square from the finish, it can only move forward if only one die shows that number (so if two or three dice are that number, the horse cannot move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would think the game plays best with 2, 3 or 6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
