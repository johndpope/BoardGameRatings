							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BattleTech: More Tales Of The Black Widow</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The fury that was the Fourth Succession War crippled Wolf's Dragoons forces but not their will to survive. After taking the full brunt of House Kurita's wrath, Jaime Wolf turned to Natasha Kerensky, the notorious Black Widow, for help in rebuilding his devastated mercenary unit. Under her ruthless command, the Dragoon's Black Widows returned to deadly form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the entire Inner Sphere is locked in a life or death struggle against a seemingly invincible invader known as the Clans. Some say that only the Black Widow and her men could triumph against these invaders. But Natasha Kerensky no longer fights for the Inner Sphere. Now she fights for the glory of the Clans!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More Tales Of The Black Widow chronicles Natasha Kerensky's unit's service during the Marik Civil War, the War of '39, and her latest role with Clan Wolf. This scenario pack describes 16 of the Widow's most critical battles. Also included are detailed unit rosters, personnel files, and BattleMech readouts that give the truest picture yet of the Inner Sphere's most feared mercenary commander.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario pack follows on from Tales Of The Black Widow Company and provides 19 assorted pre-prepared BattleTech scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
