			<description>From Awen Draft 3 Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What Is This?&lt;br/&gt;Awen is a fantasy roleplaying game. It is assumed that you already know what a roleplaying game is, or that someone in the group is able to pass this on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who Are The Characters?&lt;br/&gt;The characters in Awen are, as in most games, an assembly of talented individuals, each of whom has a history of being involved in active professions. These character might be especially heroic or not; they are always competent, and have had interesting lives already. Of course, things are likely about to get even more interesting for them...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What Do The Characters Do?&lt;br/&gt;Toward the end of this book, you'll find three 'situation generators'; these are kinds of action that are easy to create with this game, and get the players involved in quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Power Plays: In which the characters get caught up in faction-based intrigue, and will need to decide which way they want to push things, and how they want to affect the balance of power - ranging in scale from feuds between mercenary crew to international espionage.&lt;br/&gt;     Broken Places: In which the character go from place to place, whether as agents of a larger faction sent out to deal with issues, or as a group unto themselves, and keep finding themselves stuck in with local difficulties.&lt;br/&gt;     The Scourge: In which some significant threat is rising in an area, and the characters find themselves called on to defeat it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
