			<description>From Wikipedia,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mega-CD/Sega CD version, released by Virgin Games USA, was an entirely revamped game which had all-new levels, with development based on the David Perry engine, and was noted for its musical score by Tommy Tallarico, Bijan Shaheer, Joey Kuras, and TeknoMan. This music is generated in Q Sound. The objective is identical to the movie, which involves future soldier Kyle Reese going through the Time Displacement equipment located inside a Skynet base in the year 2029 AD, to go back in time to Los Angeles 1984 to protect Sarah Connor from the Terminator. It is considered to be the best game based on the original The Terminator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Terminator_video_games#The_Terminator_.28Virgin_video_game.29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Terminator_video_games#...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
