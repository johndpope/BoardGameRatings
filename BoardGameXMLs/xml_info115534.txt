							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Action Reflex</name>
									
			<description>From the instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll need lightning reflexes to control the bouncing ball as it speeds round a series of mazes.  But it's not as simple as it sounds.  The mazes contain many obstacles which have been designedto stretch both your mental and gameplaying skills to the limit.  Whether you're soaring over walls or crossing unleapable stretches of water you can't avoid the relentless ticking of the stopwatch.......and don't take ANYTHING for granted!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE OBJECT OF THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to complete all skill levels, each of which contain three 25-screen mazes.  Each maze must be completed within the time limit.  If at any stage the ball is destroyed, a time penalty is imposed, thus reducing your chances of completing the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
