It&amp;rsquo;s a complicated problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I realized that Claire was suffering from an abusive relationship, everything changed. There was nothing Rina or I did that could get her out of it. There was one last resort. Breaking my romantic ideals to save Claire, I had to learn the art of seduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only thing was&amp;hellip; I started to learn that there was something going on in this town. Rumors of creatures running around at night, a close call, and a textbook history that doesn&amp;rsquo;t add up. Even Claire and Rina are connected somehow. Between finding out what is really going on and saving Claire, I don't know if I could manage both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If only I could stop daydreaming so much then I might have some time. Why are my daydreams so strong now when I need to focus?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your choices change the GENRE of the game!&lt;br/&gt;Every NPC lies to you at some point in the game&lt;br/&gt;Change the ending AND the final climax!&lt;br/&gt;Daily Life-sim&lt;br/&gt;RPG Battles!&lt;br/&gt;Shocking plot-twists!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
