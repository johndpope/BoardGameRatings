			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blade Kitten is a simple and playful platform game that combines the classic 2D platform game with &amp;quot;beat 'em up&amp;quot; presented in a colorful Japanese manga style. You play the role as Kit Ballard, a young girl with cat-like features, cats ears and tail. She is an Intergalactic Bounty hunter, and one of the very best in the business. Together with her alien sidekick Skiffy and her sword, the Darque Blade, she hunts down rogue mechs and soft targets. Kit becomes the nexus of a tumultuous series of events on the strange planetoid known as HOLLOW WISH.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is hardly begun before Kit loses her spaceship, and she gets stolen an important key, which you apparently need. Now, a wild hunt begins, which the local vigilante groups only have little understanding of, and therefore Kit naturally have to fight through hordes of security guards, to come forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately, Kit is very acrobatic and can climb on most surfaces, giving good opportunities to play with the platform genre. &lt;br/&gt;The tracks are naturally linear, but on the way you can find small blind alleys and secret rooms with treasure chests. For money you can upgrade your equipment, and buy different versions of Darque Blade - a &amp;quot;Floating sword&amp;quot; that acts as your weapon. This sword has the typical two different attacks. The brief battle with enemies that are very close, - and a slightly slower beat, with greater range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Her tale is one of liberation. &lt;br/&gt;Her tail is pink.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
