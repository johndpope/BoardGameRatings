							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Turok: Battle of the Bionosaurs</name>
									
			<description>The gameplay is split into levels, each of which is in a different perspective. Level 1 is mostly side-scrolling while level 2 has a half bird's eye and half side-scrolling view. The third level is completely side-scrolling while other levels continue using this pattern. To combat enemies, players are equipped throughout the game with many types of weapons, including knives, bows, and various guns. The game also retains the emphasis of exploration found in Turok: Dinosaur Hunter by giving the player many collectible items hidden throughout each level, as well as encouraging the revisiting of certain levels with new abilities in order to obtain things they couldn't obtain earlier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Turok: Battle of the Bionosaurs&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
