Watch out! You'll win tokens if you're right but lose them if you're wrong. Think you can fool your friends? Don't let them fool you! Score enough tokens and you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tell me about...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a time when you couldn't stop laughing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;something gross you've eaten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a time when you thought you might get in trouble but didn't.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recommended age:  Ages 9 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
