							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grab the Green</name>
									
			<description>From the rules:  In the truest form of capitalism the object of this game is to make the most money.  You make money by paying the going rate for each green and then turning the green for a profit in designated cities.  He with the most in the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A &amp;quot;Monopoly&amp;quot;-like game that allows bankrupt players back in the game.  Since the rules provide for no end or winning conditions, players should set a time or money limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game was limited to a print run of 500.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
