			<description>From the 2016 Dice Tower Kickstarter Promo Pack B.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A transition from stage to the high seas might seem like an unusual career choice, but there's more piracy in acting than one might realize. Both jobs require a certain presence, both require a flair for the dramatic, and both require an encyclopedic knowledge of ropes and rigging (sets don't build themselves, after all). That said, acting doesn't pay the bills (like, ever).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Zee, the chance to perform his greatest works across the Seven Seas appeared when their troupe was embarked on a voyage to the New World. Their ship came under chase by pirates, who would certainly have taken the hapless merchantman, had not Zee stood upon the taffrail and delivered a glorious ad-hoc discourse on the nobility of all free-thinking peoples in the character of Brutus from Caesar. The pirates, so moved by the amazing performance, threw money, LOTS of money, and offered Zee a job. Zee made his choice, and has never looked back!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
