							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Awkward Family Photos Card Game</name>
									
			<description>This hilarious card game combines creative, open-ended questions with all new cringeworthy photos featuring funny family portraits, unfortunate hairstyles, weddings, vacations and holidays throughout the year!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your ridiculous answers guarantee memorable &amp;amp; awkward fun...and if you know your fellow players well enough and can impress them with your answers, you'll get the last laugh!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game is completely customizable in regards to rules changes, additions, etc. For example, you could add a couple dice to randomize your question number, rather than &amp;quot;learning the questions and choosing favorites&amp;quot;. Really, this open game allows for house rules and so forth. The options are endless and the game can be altered based on your groups play-style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Note* Dice and 'extras' do not come in this game, they are simply suggestions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the game begins, determine what 'score' you're playing to. Might be 5, might be 10, might be 34! It's up to the group to determine how long they plan to play. (See below, how to win)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, draw a photo card and choose a number (or roll a die, if thats your thing, completely up to you!). That number correlates to a question to be answered about the photo selected. Maybe you have to come up with a caption for the photo or maybe you decide what the portrait is thinking. Format similar to Cards Against Humanity, best answer wins picture card which equals 1 point. Or maybe you want to play by coming up with alternative answers and the group determines who said what best. Winner of that round keeps picture card and scores a point. First person to win &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; number of cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
