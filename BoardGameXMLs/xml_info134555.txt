			<description>Game published on the back cover to the Knockout Fun Book in 1956.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules: To play this thrilling game, you need a die, a dice cup (an egg-cup will do) and some coloured counters or buttons for aeroplanes {one for each player). Any number of players can take part, and the first to touch down on square 52 is the winner. With your last throw of the die you must get the exact number to reach 52 - if you throw too high a number you must wait another turn. We're sure that you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy this game as much as you enjoy Cadburys Milk Cnocolate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
