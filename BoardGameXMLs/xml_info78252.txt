			<description>From the Text:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a puzzle-adventure game that is designed for solo play. To play, you'll need a deck of cards without jokers, a pencil with eraser, a photocopy of the game record sheet and this book close at hand. A place holder of some kind, like a coin or a paper-cip, can be very handy and minimize erasing, and a clean area of a foot-and-a-haf square in which to lay out the cars would be ideal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game requires no setup besides gathering the stuff above and shuffling the deck, and can take very little play space because the cards mostly remain in the deck -- the deck is never shuffled during play, and the cards' sequence (repeated, as that discard is to the bottom) sets the order of the encounters. Some cards jump that order, others cards move their neighbors around, all within the context of some strange dream you are having.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to find your heart &amp;ndash; somwhere in this strange house, in this shifting dream, your heart has been mislain. When you find it, you can wake, and be free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
