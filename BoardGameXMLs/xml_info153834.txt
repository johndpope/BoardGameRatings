							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Little Big Game of Bupkis</name>
									
			<description>The first player to reach zero, zilch, nothing - Bupkis! - wins the game. Players don't need to reach zero exactly to win. It's the only game in which zero is everything!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bupkis is a card game played with 2 decks of cards. One deck is a regular deck of playing cards, and the other deck has from one to 3 numbers on them that range from zero (the Bupkis!) card up to 4 figures. Each number card has the four arithmetic operators (plus, minus, multiply and divide) on the bottom left with some or all of them in a darker font. The darker operators are the ones the player is allowed to use during the hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round the players are dealt 10 cards and randomly take a Number Card. The players must use the allowable operators on the Number Card to use all the Playing Cards in their hand to total the number or numbers on their card. The player who goes out receives the total of the cards left in the other player's hand as a score. The score is subtracted from the starting score of 500. The first player to reach 0 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
