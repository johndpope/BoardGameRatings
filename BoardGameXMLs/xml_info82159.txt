							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chuck Yeager&#039;s Air Combat</name>
									
			<description>Chuck Yeager's Air Combat is a 1991 computer aircraft simulation game produced by Electronic Arts. Famed pilot Chuck Yeager  was a technical consultant in the game and his digitized voice is featured in the game, giving encouragement and praises before and after missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is characterized for its good balance of an action laden gameplay which focuses on classical dog fights and a simple but still realistic flight model which justifies calling Chuck Yeager's Air Combat a simulation. Unlike in many other flight simulation games of its day, altitude and aircraft characteristics have a big influence on the behaviour of the game's simulated aircraft. Realism has been sacrificed to some degree to enhance gameplay however: E.g. a real fighter plane expends all of its ammunition after a few short bursts, while in Chuck Yeager's Air Combat the rate of fire has been reduced considerably, making dog fights longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To assist a newcomer to the game several help features can be activated, such as unlimited ammunition or easier aiming. A virtual Chuck Yeager can be activated, who gives advice.&lt;br/&gt;[..]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aircraft&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game featured six player-flyable aircraft: P-51D Mustang, F-86E Sabre, F-4E Phantom II, Fw.190A-8, the Soviet MiG-15 'Fagot' and MiG-21MF 'Fishbed'. Other featured AI-driven aircraft were: Me.109E, Me.110B, Me-163B Komet, Me-262 Schwalbe , P-47D Thunderbolt, Yak-9, MiG-17MF 'Fresco' and F-105D Thunderchief as opposing fighters and B-17E, B-29C, B-52 and L-5 as aircraft to either protect or shoot down, depending on the mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flying Modes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three different fly modes were available: Free Flight, which put the user in a selected airplane in a non-hostile environment; Create a Mission, where the user could specify which airplane to pilot against a selected number of AI-driven aircraft of varying levels of difficulty; and Historical Flight, where user could select among three wars to fly in: World War II, Korean, and Vietnam.&lt;br/&gt;[..]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Chuck Yeager's Air Combat&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
