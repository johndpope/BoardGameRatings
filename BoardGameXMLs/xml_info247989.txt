			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Put the &amp;ldquo;garden&amp;rdquo; in &amp;ldquo;garden planet!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amaze, challenge, and torture your players with alien plants from a strange world &amp;mdash; in Wonders of the Cosmos: Strange Plants Under a Red Star!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Wonders of the Cosmos attempts to give players and gamemasters some new and wondrous addition to the Starfinder Roleplaying Game in a single, small volume. Be it a new world to explore, a new subsystem to exploit, or just rules clarifications and ideas for how to make something work in the Starfinder Roleplaying Game, the design of each Wonders of the Cosmos is to provide just enough material to help you add the element to your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Wonders of the Cosmos: Strange Plants Under a Red Star, we present the plant life on a planet orbiting a red dwarf. Challenged by this unusual world, the flora of UX-5396 have developed unusual means of survival, resulting in appearances unlike any across the known universe. Included are two new hazards for explorers: spores that cause anaphylactic shock and a pallid vine that paralyzes and then slowly dissolves any who wander too close.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
