			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The High Elf is a new Hero for you to use in the Chronicles of Arax solo adventure game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While most of the elven people live within the trees, either in shelters built upon the ground or in specially crafted tree-houses high in the branches, some elves live a life of pure luxury.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These elves - the High Elves, as they are called - live in the great crystal towers that exist in within the Greatwood. They are great magic users and, due to the nature of these crystal towers - they focus the natural mana of the land into pools that allow those near them to cast spells of great power - they have become the pinnacle of elven spell casters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Age of Golden Dreams, before the evil came to Arax, the High Elves helped shape the Greatwood and, to a lesser extent, the world around it. When the Age of Darkness and Nightmares began, they instead began to focus their magic on driving back the evil tide that began to spread throughout the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alas, their efforts have been in vain. The Greatwood has been defiled on all sides and the elven people decimated. The High Elves have helped slow the forces of evil but even their immense powers cannot seem to stop them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Desperately the High Elves seek a way to stop the armies of darkness that now seem poised to conquer Arax. Whether they will or not, only time will tell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
