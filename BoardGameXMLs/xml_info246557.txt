							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dark Tower of Arcma</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dark Tower of Arcma is an OSRIC(tm) module designed for 6-10 adventurers of levels 6-10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For many years now the locals around the village of Dunmoth have spoken only in whispers about the strange goings on in the Wild Woods around the village. Tales of a dark tower that appears in the night and then disappears again by day have been passed along for generations in the village. Strange creatures have been seen around this tower the like of which have never been seen or even heard of before. Creatures that appear almost to be some kind of monstrous combination of some of the most hideous and horrifying creatures known are claimed to have been seen near this tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rumors of the tower&amp;rsquo;s return have circulated, and a hearty band of adventures has left to explore the dread place. The question remains if they can return, however&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
