			<description>&amp;quot;Jose de San Martin led the battle for independence against the Spanish in the southern part of South America. His efforts were instrumental in the liberation of Argentina and Chile. His greatest victory came in 1818 at the the Battle of Maipo in Chile. In this decisive battle he defeated the final Spanish offensive and secured the freedom of Chile.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This miniatures wargame is intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures mounted two per base, except for commanders which are mounted singly. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules. Each side has one overall commander and assorted infantry, cavalry, and cannon units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
