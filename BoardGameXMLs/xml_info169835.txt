							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Langstone Ruins</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A printable rpg battlemap compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl or skirmish game. Use as a standalone gameboard, or combine with any same-scale tileset. The map is 50x50, equivalent to 25 of our standard 10x10 tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: A huge map depicting the ancient ruins of Langstone Castle. Walls have crumbled and fallen, blocks are covered with soil and grasses and nature has begun to reclaim the land. Bushes, ivy and mosses cover the stones and, whilst the shape of the castle is still apparent, it won't be long before it is just a memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uses: Explore the ruins and find the Kings Sword, defeat the Orc Warlord that has made camp in the ruins, seek shelter in the ruins, hunt the Chimera that lives somewhere near the ancient walls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    250dpi A4 pdf, with gridded map spread across 50 pages for easy printing.&lt;br/&gt;    250dpi A4 pdf, with gridless map spread across 50 pages for easy printing.&lt;br/&gt;    250dpi full jpeg versions for VTT or poster printing (gridded and gridless)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Whilst the download looks large, it consists of several separate files - just download the versions you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A note on VTT use - we have deliberately kept the quality of the file high, and you may need to resize the jpeg for use in your VTT software. Keeping the file size and resolution high gives you the flexibility to use the map how you want - crop out a particular section or use the entire map, the choice is yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
