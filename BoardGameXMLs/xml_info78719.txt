			<description>&amp;quot;Cameltry is an arcade video game released in 1989 by Taito. The game ran on Taito's F2 system hardware and used the same optical rotary system utilized in Taito's 1986 arcade game Arkanoid. It was later ported in 1992 to the Super NES, and in 1993 to the FM Towns computer. The Super NES release was titled On The Ball in North America and Europe, and was compatible with the Super NES Mouse. The gameplay consists of moving a ball through a labyrinth by rotating the board itself around the ball. In 2006, Taito released an updated version for the Nintendo DS in Japan called Mawashite Koron, which made its way to North America and Europe in 2007 under the name Labyrinth. A version of the game is also available for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and PC, as part of the Taito Legends 2 collection, and for the PlayStation Portable, as part of the Taito Legends Power-Up collection. Another updated version was released for the iPhone OS in 2009 and Zune HD in 2010.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Cameltry , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
