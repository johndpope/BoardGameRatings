			<description>Vol. X No. 3 of Dragon Magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cover Art: It's fitting that an issue filled with things we've never done before should start off with a cover that's unlike any of the ninety-nine that preceded it.  The artwork is actually a paper sculpture created by TSR's Dennis Kauth, who built up shapes and surfaces from a flat background to produce this scene of a faerie dragon serenely gliding along the edge of a stream, while the sword and small pile of coins suggest that some other creature had come this way before.  The sculpture was turned into a photograph after being illuminated to bring out the three-dimensional aspects of the piece, and for an extra touch we tossed in some color on the dragon and the &amp;quot;Dragon&amp;quot; and had the colored part of the cover embossed.  Why purple?  Because a purple faerie dragon is the oldest and most powerful of its kind.  And the faerie dragon itself is symbolic of DRAGON Magazine's contributions to the AD&amp;amp;D game; the description of the creature, originally written by Brian Jaeger, appeared in issue #62 and was later picked up for inclusion in Monster Manual II. (from the contents page)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue featured a special center pull-out Saga of Old City Poster by Clyde Caldwell, The City Beyond the Gate - A high-level AD&amp;amp;D adventure, and two special features from Gary Gygax: At Moonset Blackcat Comes - a short story of Gord of Greyhawk, and the Dragonchess game, as well as the regular ARES Section - 16-page spotlight on SF Gaming.&lt;br/&gt;It also listed the &amp;quot;Gamers' Guide,&amp;quot; which was an index of all the advertising in the issue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
