			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OSR Bonus Cards are a fun fantasy gaming aid designed to give low- to mid-level characters an extra edge without unbalancing the game. The group receives a number of cards (determined by a die roll) at the beginning of the night. Each card provides small bonuses that may be used over the course of the session. Some bonuses are generic (+1 to-hit, +1 to saving throw, etc.) while others are class-specific (bonus to Turn undead, +10% to a thief skill, etc.). OSR Bonus Cards are a great way to shake up the game and add some randomness to the typical resource management systems we've all grown accustomed to. Still not convinced? Just listen to what these basic characters have to say:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;These things are great!&amp;quot; says Basic Fighter. &amp;quot;I was lucky enough to draw an extra attack card in the last dungeon we were in, which was a huge help against the dragon on the lowest level.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I was initially opposed to these cards,&amp;quot; says Basic Cleric. &amp;quot;They seemed gimmicky and I hate gimmicks. But after using them, I have to admit they do come in pretty handy.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I agree!&amp;quot; says Basic Thief. &amp;quot;Without that Hide in Shadows bonus, I surely would have been spotted by those city guardsmen.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;  &amp;quot;I just wish we had these back when we were starting. They would have been so helpful in places like that Silver Princess's Palace or that crazy Amber Castle.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;-54 OSR Bonus Cards (assembly required)&lt;br/&gt;-3 methods of card allocation&lt;br/&gt;-Lots and lots of fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OSR Bonus Cards may be used with any retroclone version of the world's most popular fantasy roleplaying game. Simply print the deck on cardstock and cut out the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
