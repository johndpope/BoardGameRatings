							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Anachronomicon</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sensational find has been announced in a leading bibliographical journal - a book was discovered in the archives of a German family by one Professor Hasburg of the University of Munich. The book has been reliably dated using physical methods to the early 11th century. It is written in three languages - Latin, Arabic and Akkadian, the language of the ancient Sumerian and Babylonian Empires, which was thought to have died out in the 1st Millennium BCE and was not rediscovered until the late 19th century. While the find is largely denounced as a hoax, the scientific support for its veracity is considerable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
