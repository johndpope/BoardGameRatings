			<description>Prelude to Disaster: The Soviet Spring Offensive - May 1942, is Volume No. 6 of the Winter Storm Campaign Series by Clash of Arms Games, original designed by John Schettler and has the same Basic Rules like Edelweiss and Last Victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game covers the time between the end of the Soviet Winter counteroffensive and the beginning of the German Stalingrad campaign. In early May 1942, four Soviet armies stands poised to liberate Kharkov and seize the Dnepr River crossings, destroying all the German armies in the south Ukraine. The Germans themselves are preparing to nip the Soviet thrust at its base. Victory hangs in the balance and the entire course of the summer&amp;rsquo;s campaign will depend upon who can strike first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game provides two scenarios that can be played to conclusion in a single sitting. The number of units on each side is large but not overwhelming. And play balance is such that either side has a chance to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: 2 days&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 5 miles / 8.5 Km&lt;br/&gt;Units: Battalion to Corps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;One 22 x 34&amp;quot; full color map&lt;br/&gt;Three dual-side printed countersheets (720 1/2&amp;quot; counters)&lt;br/&gt;One 32-page Winter Storm Campaign Series Standard Rules 2nd Edition rulebook&lt;br/&gt;One 24-page Prelude to Disaster rulebook&lt;br/&gt;Two single-side printed Army Organization Player Aid cards&lt;br/&gt;One 12-page Charts &amp;amp; Tables booklet&lt;br/&gt;Two 6-sided dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Playability: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: High&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 8-10 hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
