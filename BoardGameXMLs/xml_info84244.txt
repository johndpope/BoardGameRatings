			<description>Ardy Lightfoot is a platform game released on the Super Nintendo in 1993 in Japan and 1996 in the US. It was developed by ASCII and published by Titus in the US. Ardy Lightfoot is a anthropomorphic  creature resembling a fox or cat. He is accompanied by his best friend Pec, a blue penguin. Pec can be used as a weapon, or can take the role of various other helpful devices like a hot air balloon or rock destroyer. If Ardy is hit by an enemy, Pec disappears, and can be retrieved back from a chest. If Ardy is without Pec, he can still attack by bouncing on his tail. He can also protect himself temporarily by hiding behind a mirror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ardy Lightfoot,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
