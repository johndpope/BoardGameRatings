			<description>Subtitled The Ewok Color Matching Game, this is a Star Wars childrens game that combines the rules of Go Fish and Pit. The deck consists of 35 Ewok cards - 5 each of 7 different colors. Players are dealt five cards each and the rest are placed on the table to form a draw pile. On a turn you may ask any player for a specific color. If the player you ask has a card or cards of that color, he or she must give you one of them. If you have two or more matching colors in your hand, place them face-up in front of you to start a collection. If you wish to change colors, discard the collection in front of you and play the new one. You always start your turn by drawing cards from the draw pile or discard pile to bring your hand to 5. You end your turn by discarding a card to the discard pile. The winner is the first player to collect all 5 cards of 1 color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This children's game was intended for Ages 4 - 8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
