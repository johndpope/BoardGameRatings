							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Napoleon and the Archduke Charles: The Battle of Eckmuhl</name>
									
			<description>This games was published in Strategy &amp;amp; Tactics magazine #114. Napoleon and the Archduke Charles: The Battle of Eckmuhl is a game for two players, simulating the battle of Eckmuhl which took place on April 21-22, 1809. One player commands the French forces, the other the Austrians. The map is an accurate representation of the battlefield, the counters represent the forces which took part, and rules on movement, combat, leadership and morale reflect the problems and possibilities which faced the historical commanders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scale of the combat is that one strength point represent 200 infantry, 150 cavalry or 2 guns, each turn is 35 minutes; each hex is 600 yards. Victory is determined my control of objective hexes and loss inflicted on the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note:&lt;br/&gt;Eckmuhl is a complete game in itself. It can also be played as a &amp;ldquo;campaign game&amp;rdquo; linked with another of 3W&amp;rsquo;s Bonaparte series, The Battle of Abensberg (in S&amp;amp;T #113). Eckmuhl was fought on the two days following Abensberg, in the area immediately to the north. Many of the same units participated, along with many others. Two scenarios were provided with Abensberg; four are provided with Eckmuhl. A further dozen scenarios will be found in The Wargamer #3 and S&amp;amp;T #115 (Kanev). These later scenarios link the two games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategy &amp;amp; Tactics magazine #116 adds two more scenarios and a Q&amp;amp;A by the designer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
