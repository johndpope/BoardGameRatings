			<description>Revolt is a two-player space combat game set in the inner solar system; the map's outer edge is the orbit of Jupiter. One player represents a solar system government and the other player a rebellion against it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each side has a fleet of ships and a number of bases. Ship counters can represent any number of ships so each player knows where the other has forces but not how strong they are. The ships use vector movement; they can accelerate or decelerate a certain amount each turn and also change heading a certain amount (in 5-degree increments); their movement vectors are drawn on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is deterministic; the attacker's strength is divided by the distance between the attacker and defender to determine the number of strength points lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sun's gravitational effects are taken into account for ship movement, but those of the planets are not. The planets and space stations move along their orbits during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the government player is to eliminate all rebel ships and bases; the rebel player wins if they can avoid this for 30 turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic rules for the game were published in four issues of International Wargamer beginning with the December 1970 issue. The game was also available from the designers; this version included additional tournament rules and presumably also contained the map and counters, as they did not appear in the magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
