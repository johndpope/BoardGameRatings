			<description>Oolong is a strategy game of area control for two players. Take turns serving tea to tables in the tea house in an attempt to serve more of your tea than your opponent. Your turn consists of simply placing a token on a tile, but your play tells your opponent where they&amp;rsquo;re allowed to play next. Controlling a tile will trigger that table&amp;rsquo;s special of the day, a unique one-time ability. Will you be shrewd enough to fully serve the most tables and savor sweet victory?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 9 tiles are arranged like the points of a compass rose (plus the center). Players take turns placing a token of their color. The space in which a token is placed indicates the tile on which the next player will place their token. The player who is first to occupy 5 spaces on a tile controls that tile. Unique special abilities for each tile are triggered at different levels of completeness. Whomever is first to control 5 tiles wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
