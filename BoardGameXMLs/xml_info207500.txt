			<description>Great Comics Adventure is a tabletop card game celebrating the history of Comic Book Characters from the Golden Age. The deck includes 90 Triumph Cards and 18 City Cards. Several major cities are represented in 'The Great Comic Adventure' (GCA) all featured as post-cards. On the back of each post-card is the sequence of cards required to 'claim' that city. Once the five cards in your hands match the post-card, it is then claimed. Once you claim a city you will grab another, and once you claim three cities you win the round!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the characters and images used in this game are from the Public Domain, so they belong to all of us! In general, works published after 1977 will not fall into the public domain until 70 years after the death of author, or, for corporate works, anonymous works, or works for hire, 95 years from the date of publication or 120 years from the date of creation, whichever expires first. Pre-1978 works what are in the public domain because they were published without proper copyright notice, or, in the case of pre-1964 works, were not timely renewed, do not receive retroactive protection under the CTEA. Similarly, works published before 1923, do not receive retroactive protection, and remain in the public domain. All of these comic books were published in the Golden Age of Comic Book History which all started with one super hero, Superman. The Golden Age could be given a specific start time thank to Superman #14 (Feb. 1942), this is when we ushered in the Golden Age of Comic Books. The Golden Age of Comic Books describes an era of American comic books from the late 1930s to the early 1950s. During this time, modern comic books were first published and rapidly increased in popularity. All the comics in the game feature comics from the 1940's and 1950's along with the post card designs featured as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
