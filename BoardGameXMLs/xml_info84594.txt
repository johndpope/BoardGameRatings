			<description>Skate (marketed as skate.) is a skateboarding video game developed by EA Black Box for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It was released in North America on September 17, 2007 for the Xbox 360 and September 24, 2007 for the PlayStation 3 and in Europe on September 28, 2007 for the Xbox 360 and October 5, 2007 for the PlayStation 3. As of February 1, 2008, Skate has outsold the 2007 skateboarding game Tony Hawk's Proving Ground by a ratio of almost 2 to 1 on seventh generation video game consoles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a custom-designed skateboarder in the fictional town of San Vanelona. Skating challenges are marked on a mini-map, along with stores and subway stations that allow the player to traverse the city quickly. As the player develops their skills and performs various tasks (such as completing certain tricks while being filmed), sponsorship and notability are acquired, eventually leading to participation in the X Games. &amp;quot;Filming&amp;quot; challenges allow the player to create a line of tricks to meet the filming goals; the player may also place a session marker to return to a spot quickly after finishing a line. Several &amp;quot;own the spot&amp;quot; locations throughout the city allow the player to try to claim that spot by beating a certain score requirement, thus &amp;quot;owning&amp;quot; the spot from other skaters. Additionally, there are jam sessions and &amp;quot;death races&amp;quot; against other AI-controlled characters. Completing challenges will generally unlock new clothing and equipment items, characters, and additional challenges to compete in. Players are able to create and edit short video clips (15 to 30 seconds) at any time, selecting desired camera angles and video effects, and upload them to EA's &amp;quot;Skate Reel&amp;quot; website to share with others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Skate (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
