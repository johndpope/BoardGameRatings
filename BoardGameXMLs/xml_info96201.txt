			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Nova was the first commercial release from Big Five Software, a company that would become renowned for high quality adaptations of popular arcade games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Nova was based on the 1979 arcade game Asteroids, and it offers all the same controls as the arcade game: rotate left, rotate right, thrust, fire, and hyperspace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is roughly equivalent to the arcade game. The player controls a ship that must blast through a series of asteroid fields. Each shot that hits causes an asteroid to break into one or more smaller asteroids, with the smallest of the asteroids being vaporized into nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This task is complicated by the occasional appearance of alien spaceships. The most powerful of these, the iconic &amp;quot;Flagship&amp;quot;, features a rotating &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; and fires deadly laser bolts at the player's ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Flagship would go on to star in other Big Five releases, as well as making unofficial appearances in TRS-80 games created others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
