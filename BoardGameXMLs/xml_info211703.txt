			<description>WORLD AT WAR 85, VOLUME 4: AMERICA BREACHED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re not even supposed to do things like this, the Police Captain thought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She did not give credence to the initial phone reports a half hour ago, but now the growl of approaching Cuban armored vehicles echoed in the streets among the buildings of her town. She continued to shout to her officers last moment, desperate instructions: &amp;ldquo;Heads low! Stay behind the car doors or anything else solid. And if whatever we are hearing turns out to be way heavier than I think &amp;ndash; if it shoots at you, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to RUN back to the Rally Point.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AMERICA BREACHED is the fourth volume in The WORLD AT WAR 85 SERIES of games of fast and furious platoon-level combat. The series is set in 1985, in an alternate history of World War III. With the Warsaw Pact armies deep into Western Europe, and war zones appearing around the world drawing away U.S. ground reinforcements, an unlikely yet powerful collection of allies seize the opportunity to storm across the Rio Grande in force, raiding deep into Texas, ostensibly to deny the U.S. parts of its oil resources. If they succeed in their goal, they potentially might disrupt U.S. military operations worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The WORLD AT WAR 85 system features a unique combat system that involves die rolls by both attacking units and defending units, which keeps both players engaged throughout the game. Die rolls are compared and hits applied quickly, as all the information you need to fight your units is on the counters. No combat results table is necessary. Initiative, formation activation, random turn length, close air support and air cover are all integrated smoothly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
