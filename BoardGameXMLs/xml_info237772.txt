							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Holiday Encounters</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Holiday Encounters! This is designed and dedicated to give more realism to your worlds by adding traditions and holidays. Some holidays have been modified to fit a more fantasy-like setting instead of traditional earth-type holidays. For example, St. Valentine probably doesn't exist in your world, so Valentines day was changed to Love Day. In this material you'll find over twenty new custom holiday themed creatures and creations with full stat blocks, pictures, and descriptions. These creatures range from groundhogs, to leprechauns, to Santa Claus himself! You'll also find, for your creative tweaking some holiday themed magic items that characters may come across during the holidays. This manual is listed in order of holidays by traditional months they occur in. Like all creatures in the world of Dungeons and Dragons these creatures can be modified anyway you like and were created for inspiration and ideas for your enjoyment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
