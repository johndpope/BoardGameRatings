							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lair of the Spider Mother</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Step into my parlor said the spider to the fly..&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And the spider Mother bids you the same welcome. Are you strong enough to journey to her island domain and recover the three symbols of a king's power? Are you swift enough to defeat her guardians and evade her traps?  Have you the nerve to face her minions and her children?  Have you the power to defeat the Mistress of the Webs herself?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aye, perhaps you think you do. But then, so did the others...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lair of the Spider Mother is a fantasy adventure for four to six characters of 3rd -5th levels of experience and is suitable for most FRP systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
