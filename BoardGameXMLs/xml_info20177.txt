							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">40 Master Composers</name>
									
			<description>This game contains cards for 40 composers from Bach to Weber.  Each card has a picture of the composer and 5 questions relating to their life and work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt 4 cards and the rest are left aside.  Next, players get a 2 minute study period to look over their cards.  When the two minutes is up, the dealer calls out &amp;quot;Pass.&amp;quot;  Each player passes their cards to the right.  After the pass, the dealer asks the player on their left any question from any of the cards in their hand.  If the player answers correctly, they are given the card, which they place face up in front of them (scoring it).  If the answer is wrong, the dealer scores the card by placing it face up.  Then, the player to the left of the dealer asks a question of the player to their left and so on around the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all players have a chance to ask and answer a question, scores are tallied.  The cards in play are then shuffled and placed on the bottom of the deck and 4 new cards are dealt to each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest score at the end of all of the deals wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
