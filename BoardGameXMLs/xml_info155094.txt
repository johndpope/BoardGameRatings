							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroes of Equestria 3.75th Edition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The magical land of Equestria is now yours to explore in this Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons inspired tabletop RPG. Based off of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, this game will provide everything you need to play a game within the world of the show. When I wrote this game, my first priority was versatility. You can play a slice of life adventure or a more traditional adventure with swords and sorcery. The rules are also written as clearly as possible, but still provide a lot of flexibility for changes and additions. This is a game that is accessible to newcomers and advanced players alike and with detailed lists for abilities, monsters, magic, and items, there's plenty to give you ideas. So give it a try and if people like it, then I might release some expansions to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
