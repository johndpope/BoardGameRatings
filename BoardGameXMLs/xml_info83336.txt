			<description>NCAA Football '06, known colloquially as College Football 2006 is a collegiate American football video game which was released on July 11, 2005. The product features former Michigan Wolverines standout and Heisman Trophy winner Desmond Howard  on the cover. He is the only cover athlete not to have played the year before their respective game, Howard last played at Michigan in 1991. It is the only game as of 2010 to have a music soundtrack as the others play school fight songs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NCAA Football 06 features a new game mode, &amp;quot;Race for the Heisman.&amp;quot; In &amp;quot;Race for the Heisman&amp;quot;, you begin as a high school standout hoping to sign with a major college program. After choosing your position and your position-specific drill, you are offered three scholarships, or you can walk on to a school of your choice. The prestige of the offering schools depends on how you performed in your drill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another new feature in NCAA Football 06 is the Impact Player. Each team has three impact players, usually the three highest rated players on the roster, but there is always at least one impact player on offense and on defense. (In Dynasty mode some teams only have two Impact Players in later years) Some teams' kickers or punters are impact players, too. Offensive linemen are never impact players in the game. Impact players are called upon to make big plays when &amp;quot;in the zone&amp;quot; (indicated by their white impact icon underneath them pulsating). If they execute a big play, action pauses and the camera zooms in on the tackle, juke move, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Still around from the previous version are the Top 25 toughest places to play (The University of Florida's Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, or &amp;quot;The Swamp&amp;quot;, remains #1 in 06), a still-revamped Dynasty Mode (with a new In-Season Recruiting feature), all-time and historic teams, Create-a-School, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;NCAA Football 06&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
