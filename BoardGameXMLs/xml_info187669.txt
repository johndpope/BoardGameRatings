							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Die kleine Raupe Nimmersatt: 1 • 2 • 3 Stapelei</name>
									
			<description>The caterpillar is hungry and eats its way through fruits, vegetables and all sorts of other goodies. Children help him fight his way through the largest possible number of threats. This creates a tower of cards. But be careful! If someone is not careful, the tower collapses and the caterpillar must start from scratch...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every card has a hole in it. The first player has to stack one card of his choice over the caterpillar, always leaving the caterpillar's head visible. All players do the same, increasing the stack, and trying not to collapse the stack.&lt;br/&gt;If you collapse the stack, all the other players gain a butterfly chip except you. If the players manage to put all the cards in the stack without it falling, then all players get a butterfly chip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one or more players have won five &amp;quot;Butterfly&amp;quot; chips. These players are the winners!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
