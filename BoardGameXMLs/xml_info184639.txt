							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bus- und Bahn-Würfelspiel &quot;Grüne Welle&quot;</name>
									
			<description>The players have to move 3 playing pieces (car, bicycle, bus/train) from start to finish. Movement is determined by two dice. The player may chose to use the result of either die or the sum of both dice to move one playing piece. Only pieces of different kinds may pass each other. A bus is different than a train, even if they are the same playing piece. So they can't be blocked and always have a &amp;quot;green wave&amp;quot;. If a player gets on a blue space he has to follow the instruction for his playung piece. On a green or a red space the player has to draw an event-card or a decision-card. The first player to reach the finish with all three playing pieces wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
