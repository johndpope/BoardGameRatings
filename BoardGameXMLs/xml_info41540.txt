			<description>To Bethlehem - The Christmas Game for the Entire Family&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;If you're looking for something to bring your family together at Christmas, this game is for you!&amp;quot; - The Family man&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to help families talk, laugh, act goofy, and spend time together as they focus of the real meaning of Christmas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a roll the die, move the pawn and do what ever the game square you land on tells you to do. Landing on a square marked &amp;quot;Around the Campfire&amp;quot; requires drawing a card and interacting based upon what the card is asking for. Such questions can include things like what is your favorite Christmas smell and what is the strangest Christmas tradition you have heard of?  The ultimate goal is to reach the square with baby Jesus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game Board &lt;br/&gt;10 Plastic Pawns&lt;br/&gt;1 Six Sided Die&lt;br/&gt;72 Plastic Gold Shekels&lt;br/&gt;Campfire Cards&lt;br/&gt;Trader Moe's Deed and Parking Passes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
