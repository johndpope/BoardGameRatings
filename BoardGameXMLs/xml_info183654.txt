			<description>Devine Super H&amp;eacute;ros is a game of memory and deduction. Each game lasts 15 minutes. Among a hand of 16 cards, each player chooses a character and places it on a stand before them, hidden from their opponent. By asking each other questions, each player must guess the Super Hero chosen by the other player. The first to guess the other's superhero wins! This plays very similarly to Guess Who.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
