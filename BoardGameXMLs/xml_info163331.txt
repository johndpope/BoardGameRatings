							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Jester</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new arcane controller PC class for 4th edition is bound to teach you a few new tricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a jester, many call you a fool. Those who do either know you well or not at all - and few know you well. To your companions, you are an enigma, performing stunts that only the foolish would attempt when they know, better than most, that your mind borders on genius. But genius or not, the subject of your mental acuity is forever off-limits. After all, people tend to speak more freely around a joker than an ace, and that is precisely as you like it. Jesters have a knack for jumping into any social circle, a part of none and hearing candid words from each. Information so gathered is the jester's most powerful tool, for the proper information spoken into the proper ear at the proper time can alter the course of history. Through his unique powers, a jester is able to slowly fulfill his charter to align the world to his henge, altering the planes in fate changing ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
