			<description>Educational game for teaching elementary math. A player starts by taking a face up card or one from the deck. The player then checks his hand for any matching pairs to form a complete and correct simple arithmetic equation. These pairs are placed face up on the table, and the player then discards one card. The game continues until one player rids his hand of all pairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
