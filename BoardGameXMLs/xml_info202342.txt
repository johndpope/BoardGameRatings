							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lonely Meadows Raid</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are driving down a narrow country road, all of us, on a  bright, sunny day. The area around us is flat, and fields line  both sides of the road.  A small but thick cluster of trees lay  straight ahead, and the road takes us right into those trees.  It  is then that a marvelous change happens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trees become thicker and thicker, and all at once we are in a  dense forest. Then the car disappears from around us, and we are  each marching on a narrow path. We carry shields and medieval  weapons.  Traveling with us is a lion and a wolf.  We are surprised but not shaken. Somehow we know that we are on a dragon  raid for Jesus Christ.  But instead of being on Earth, we are on  the planet of EdenAgain where He is called the OverLord of many  names. And the lion and the wolf talk!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
