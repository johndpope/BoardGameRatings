							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Compact Heroes Starter Electronic Version</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now a pdf version of Compact Heroes Role-playing card game is free!  That's right, it's free.  Included in this version are more than 100 of the cards that are in the retail master boxed set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is Compact Heroes?  In a nutshell, CH is played exactly the same way you would play a traditional role-playing game, except with the portability of a card game.  No heavy books or bags full of dice to lug around.  And yet, it offers the same amount of character customization as most full sized role-playing games.  Perfect for military personell, college students, and anyone else limited on space who wants their rpg fix in.  And it does it well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This free pdf version is just to give you a taste of what you can expect, including about 2/3 of the cards that would be in the Master Set.  Physical decks and the Master Boxed Set are available for purchase either at your local gaming store, or at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.sacrosanctgames.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.sacrosanctgames.com&lt;/a&gt;.  With your support and purchase of the physical version of the game, we will be able to finish up expansions that give you more skills, magic items, and monsters to encounter in your adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
