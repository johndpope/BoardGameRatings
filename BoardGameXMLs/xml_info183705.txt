			<description>From the box front:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 3D Balancing Animal Game. Easy to learn, exciting and quick to play and Educational too! To beat the clock, pile on the pressure, don't tip the balance. Hundreds of ways to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box rear: The first player turns over top card and the sand timer. The player then attempts to Score by performing a successful Balazoo before the timer runs out. A successful Balazoo occurs when all 5 animals are arranged in a pattern very similar to that shown on the configuration card. The player must take their hands away and the animals must freely stand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
