			<description>The Mexican Rails kit was originally conceived as an expansion to Empire Builder and available directly from Mayfair. It includes some new cards, tokens, and a map of Mexico that could be aligned with the Empire Builder board, but all the components were black &amp;amp; white copies packed in a 9&amp;times;12 envelope with a Mexican Rails sticker on it. Rather than upgrade to production quality similar to the base game, the board, loads, and cards were incorporated into North American Rails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was also published in Games International (Issue 7 â€“ July 1989) magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Empire Builder&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
