			<description>Hiryu no Ken (Japanese: 飛龍の拳 Hiryu no Ken) is a video game series released by Culture Brain. The NES game that was released in North America as Flying Warriors is a mixture of two Famicom video games (Hiryu no Ken II: Dragon no Tsubasa and Hiryu no Ken III: 5 Nin no Ryuu Senshi) and implements ideas and elements from both games, thus making it hard to tell which of the two is officially its Japanese version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first installment of the Hiryu no Ken series had already been released in North America as Flying Dragon: The Secret Scroll, with virtually no modification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features combat in a variety of formats, such as kicking and using fireballs to repel monsters in scrolling stages, a system during one-on-one duels against Tusk Soldiers or a pair of martial arts tournaments where the player must attack a mark that appears on their opponent's body, or defend the area when it appears on them (this system is similar to Culture Brain's original Flying Dragon  for the NES), and RPG-style command battles against monster bosses. When confronted by a Tusk Soldier or other otherworldly villain, Rick can change into a costumed superhero form or switch with one of his teammates. The player must switch to Flying Warrior form to use the characters' magic powers and defend themselves from the Tusk Soldiers' magic spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Flying Warriors&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
