			<description>Barbarians. Borderers. Nomads. The Hyborian Age is a world that is violent, heartless and brutal. In this dark world stalk equally violent, heartless and brutal warriors. Many are little more than bandits and murderers and others are more noble and honourable, but all of them are ferocious and enduring, able to deal out death as quickly as the world itself. What does it mean to be fierce? It means the characters stand in the world and look it straight in the eye, telling it that it has nothing on them. Sandstorms? Bah. A nomad horde is a living sandstorm, stripping the civilised of their flesh, leaving them with nothing but death in their wake. Earthquakes? Barbarians brought down Acheron, so too will they destroy the Hyborian cities with as much surety as an earthquake. Wind? Borderers are the cold draught that lays low the weak with silent wings of death. With hot, red, leaping blood are the veins of these fierce warriors rife. The barbarians, borderers and nomads of the Hyborian Age laugh with vibrant life, eager to bring down the walls and gates of civilisation, to watch it all burn as they plunder the wealth of ages, revelling in blood and gore as they wade through waves of humanity who are not fit to bow before them nor strong enough to ride and slay with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
