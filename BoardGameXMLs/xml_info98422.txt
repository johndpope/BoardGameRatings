							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anima Tactics: Arias Vayu</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Queen of the Winds, Lady of the Sylph, Stormbringer... many are the names that the Arias Vayu, the higher class of air elemental, are known by. Like lesser demigods, these creatures only walk Ga&amp;iuml;a when called by the most powerful of summoners. Able to control the weather over the whole world there powers are fearsome indeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mystic - Light Summon - Level 50&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innate Abilities: Flight, Intangible, Ranged Attack 16 inches.&lt;br/&gt;Blades of Air: Arias Vayu's Attacks ignore 1 point of their target's Armor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elemental Crystals: Arias Vayu is accompanied by four elemental crystals that must be placed in contact with her base when she is summoned to the board. The crystals move independently during Arias Vayu's activation as flying units with Speed of 12 inches and a Control Zone of 4 inches. The crystals cannot take any other action than to move and are immune to negative states. They may be the target of any attack, in which case they have a Defense of 8 and 1 LP. They can be engaged in Hand-to-hand combat, though any unit that wants to withdraw from combat with them can do so without needing to Escape first. A crystal is destroyed if it suffers any damage, and they all will be removed when Aria's Vayu leaves the game for any reason.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elemental Crystal (Magic, Effect) - Put an Elemental Crystal on the board within Arias Vayu's Control Zone. This ability only allows the replacement of already destroyed crystals. It cannot allow Arias Vayu to have more than 4 crystals on the board at once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pewter figure is unpainted and unassembled. Requires additional Anima Tactics figures to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
