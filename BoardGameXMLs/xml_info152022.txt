			<description>Realm of Wizards is a game for 2-4 players. Each wizard is assigned an element, earth (green), air (yellow), fire (red) and water (blue). The wizards summon creatures to fight to the death. The winner is the last player left in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A board section is supplied for each wizard that is partaking in the game and places it at the start of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn the wizards collect energy (magic crystals) from their current space, if it happens to be a space matching their own element type they will gain more crystals, next the wizards can move and select up to two creatures they may have summoned to move, landing on a strategic area of the board can make a big difference between success and failure. Once movement has been performed it&amp;rsquo;s time for any creatures of opposing wizards sharing a space to battle to the death, during the battle phase a creature can battle a wizard and if they win that wizard is eliminated and their part in the game is over. Once all the battles have been fought the wizards can summon a new creature to aid them in the conquest, if they happen to share a space matching their own element type they can summon two. Lastly new spells (creature counters) are collected and replenished, some are expired and returned to the counter pool ready for the next turn when each wizard left in the game must gather their thoughts and put their minds to their next strategy and prepare for the actions from the remaining wizards left in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn is broken down into steps which each wizard will perform before the next step begins. By placing their wizard and creatures in strategic positions the players can gain an important edge over their opponent that could be the difference between success and failure. A wizard in control of the elements will ultimately bring about the destruction of his enemy and rejoice in victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
