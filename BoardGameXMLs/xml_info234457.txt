							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Reaper</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death comes for us all. Whether you want it or not, death comes. It can arrive swiftly like a sudden gust of wind on a hot afternoon or it can gently creep up on you like the caress of a lover. Death does not care if you are a peasant or a king, it will come for you on equal terms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a reaper, the personification of death itself on this material plane. Your job is to pass judgement on mortals and deliver their souls to the Black Gates if you deem their time has come. Liches, necromancers, vampires, and all those who have dared to use Death&amp;rsquo;s power to command the dead or acquire immortality are your enemies. You must hunt them down at all cost. What better way of doing this than adventuring? You don't do it for fame, glory, or wealth. You do it because adventurers are always in the midst of everything happening in the world. They are, unknowingly, reapers themselves that must go to the Black Gates once their jobs are done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains two files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A 12 page playbook containing over 20 moves.&lt;br/&gt;    A two page character sheet for you to record your character's stats, gear, and moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
