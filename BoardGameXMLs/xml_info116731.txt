							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The NetHack Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Based on the most famous and popular Roguelike video game, NetHack, this two player board game adaptation is divided into three boards representing three different areas from the video game: the Mazes of Menace, the Castle and Gehennom. Each player's token moves along a fixed path and draws an encounter card on each space from the deck corresponding to the board they are on. The encounters are either monsters to be fought by die roll or items, which assist in various ways and some of which are essential to progress between boards. Players can either move carefully (they get to see the encounter card before deciding whether to proceed) or quickly (they have no choice but to face the encounter but move further if they face it successfully). To win, the players must reach the end of the board, take the Amulet of Yendor, and return back along the path to the start to escape the dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
