			<description>You&amp;rsquo;ve got the farm. You&amp;rsquo;ve got the feed. You&amp;rsquo;ve got the animals&amp;hellip; but you ain&amp;rsquo;t got no fences! In this classic game of squares, players build fences to hold in their livestock. The first player to fence in all of their animals wins! But be careful, other players can use your fences to finish their own animal pens. A game of forethought and strategy, Fenced In is fun for all ages!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though this game is virtually the classic game of Boxes, the difference is that a play wins when he or she disposes of his or her animals, rather than a final tally of &amp;quot;who has more&amp;quot;.  Additionally, the game is playable by up to 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Boxes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
