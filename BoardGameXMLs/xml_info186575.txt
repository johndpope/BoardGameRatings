							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Macbeth 20/20</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Macbeth 20/20 is a story roleplaying game based on Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s Macbeth set in a dark future. The Scotland Corporation has a rising star in its ranks &amp;mdash; an ambitious team leader named Macbeth &amp;mdash; who will stop at nothing to become the company&amp;rsquo;s CEO. Despite a rival, named Macduff, Macbeth pushes the corporation&amp;rsquo;s boundaries and limits with unscrupulous acts. The characters are members of Macbeth&amp;rsquo;s team, advising, executing, and working, while all around them the glittering advances of Macbeth&amp;rsquo;s ambitions turn to ash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protocol is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters together into dramatic situations. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
