			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trek-80 is a war game in which the player controls the Enterprise and must use its weapons systems to defend a fleet of transport tug ships.  The player wins if he manages to fend off the Klingon attack without losing more than five tugs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Publisher Catalog&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cassette tape game for the Radio Shack TRS-80 computer is our first application of a new idea in wargaming: the use of computer simulations.  It requires a computer capable of at least 16K of memory and use of the Level II BASIC computer language.  This is not just another Star Trek game: it's the toughest Trek game to beat yet.  The Enterprise must protect a Federation supply fleet of transport tugs, and the commands can control everything from combat attack sequence programming and defensive modes on the ship's computer, to evasive action to energy flow from the reactors to the various engines and phaser banks.  Phasers, photon torpedoes and Starbases are provided for.  The Klingons and the tugs all have simultaneous movement and combat: the tugs even have puny phasers and occasionally knock out Klingons themselves!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[For the SOL-20 game of the same name, see the VGG entry for Invasion Force.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
