			<description>Expedition Planning is a hand management and blind-bidding game for 2 to 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the Captain of a prestigious explorers' guild. As their leader, you will send your explorers on various expeditions in order to retrieve the earth's most valuable treasures. All of this in order to increase your guild's prestige. You will have to do this while avoiding or fighting off as many dangers as possible because losing against those ferocious creatures would tarnish your reputation!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the items you are after is part of these ancient collections. If your explorers are able to retrieve all treasures in order to form a complete collection, they become even more valuable!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ready your explorers, but make the right choice on who you send as other explorers are after the same Treasures! Whoever has the most prestigious guild in the end wins at this game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the course of 4 rounds, you will play Explorer cards from your hand in order to win Treasure cards that are worth Victory Points (VPs), while avoiding Danger cards that are worth negative VPs.
