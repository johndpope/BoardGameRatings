			<description>(from their website)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Calling All Race Fans&lt;br/&gt;CATCH THE EXCITEMENT OF &amp;quot;BIG TIME AUTO RACING&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you love stock car racing, you must play Speedway Racing's board game. The Speedway Racing  board game gives you 'big time stock car auto racing' and 'live event track action' for true, behind the wheel racing experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the Drivers Meeting, you will receive your Drivers Handbook and will learn the rules of the race.&lt;br/&gt;With one to five drivers, choose your favorite car, then 'start your engines'. Drivers race their cars around the oval track based on a roll of the dice. There are Bonus Points in the game. If you are lucky enough to roll doubles or other combinations imprinted, on the Speedway Racing game board, you will accelerate your advancement around the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Driver's meeting, you also learn that this will be a fast paced, five-lap competition. You will be driving against other highly competitive opponents. There are many Challenges and Pitfalls ahead of you as you speed around the track to take your car, to the coveted &amp;quot;Winner Circle&amp;quot;, of Speedway Racing's board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before you begin, choose Option 1, for the first driver to cross the finish line. Or, Option 2, in case all drivers are 'stacked up' and trying to cross the finish line. One last roll of the dice will determine the winner. You must choose Option 1 or Option 2, before the race begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Race is Underway! Of course, the object of the game is to win the race, but beware; there are advantages and obstacles as you thunder around the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hit the &amp;quot;Pit Stop&amp;quot; Zone or the &amp;quot;Speedway Challenge&amp;quot; Zone and adjust your position based on the events of each opportunity. Hit the wall and you suffer the consequences, in your quest. If you can avoid an accident, you will advance your position on the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take care in selecting your pit crew. Many track advantages will depend on the timing, action and reaction speed of your pit crew.A driver can pilot the race car, but the pit crew will make the crucial difference in the outcome of the victory.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;As in real speedway racing, your pit crew is vital! The Speedway Racing Board Game track graphics are beautifully illustrated. The game's race cars are authentic 1:144 scale die-cast metal with moving wheels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Challenge&amp;quot; cards and &amp;quot;Pit Stop&amp;quot; cards are&lt;br/&gt;realistic 'during the race' events. As you position your car and maneuver around the track, you will encounter cars hitting the wall, track debris, flat tires and yellow flags.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Caution Flags Are Out! Beware of Hazards!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;White-knuckle rookie drivers could hit the car in front of them, have stalled engines or make serious driving errors, while lapped traffic slows you down. The events of the &amp;quot;Speedway Racing&amp;quot; board game will impact the sheer adrenaline rush of moving forward, as you concentrate, on the coveted first place win. As you cross the Finish Line, move your car into the &amp;quot;Winner's Circle&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game contains a highly detailed graphic game board, five 1:144 scale die-cast cars with moving wheels, drivers challenge cards, dice and directions, in a re-usable bag. Family board game enthusiasts may want to have multiple games for their weekly or monthly family board game night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules, of this family board game, are easy enough for the youngest race fans, but challenging enough, to keep you and the other drivers ever watchful on the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.speedwayracing.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.speedwayracing.net/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
