			<description>Haste Worte? is a party/word game in which each turn players have 30 seconds to write as many answers as possible for the category or question that round. After 30 seconds pass, players must bid on how many unique answers they have on their list. Bids are revealed simultaneously with the player having the lowest bid reading their answers first. Any answer already named gets crossed off a player's list before they get a chance to take their turn. Players score points equal to their bids if they succeed, and the first player to make it around the game board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Haste Worte? Jubil&amp;auml;umsedition features the same gameplay as Haste Worte? and includes forty new cards compared to the original edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
