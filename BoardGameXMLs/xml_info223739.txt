Compete in an online 3v3 race where skill and collaboration are key to victory. Team up, strategize and use tactics to disrupt and beat the opposing team in a MOBA-like clash!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team Racing League has been in development for over a year. The game is inspired by retro arcade racing games like Super Off Road, Micro Machines and Championship Sprint. Instead of relying on power-ups, Team Racing League is all about teamwork and racing skills. It aims to be a pure racer, without artificial equalizing mechanics. During the game the complete track and all racers are visible in a top-down view, so that players have a clear overview to form team strategies. The mid-poly atmosphere is enhanced by an 80's style synthesizer soundtrack and palpable sound effects. Team Racing League is currently heading towards Steam Early Access.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team-based 3v3 racing&lt;br/&gt;Win together, lose together&lt;br/&gt;Support your teammates and block your opponents&lt;br/&gt;Unique connecting mechanics&lt;br/&gt;Skill-based racing&lt;br/&gt;No power-ups or weapons&lt;br/&gt;Practice against your own ghost&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
