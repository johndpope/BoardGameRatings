			<description>The ATS game engine has been ported to the ACW period by Lieutenant Colonel Mark Johnson, author of That Body of Brave Men&amp;mdash;The U.S. Regular Infantry and the Civil War in the West (in bookstores now) and the art is by renowned Civil War artist Alan Archambault.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ATS Gettysburg is a tactical-level game covering combat during the 3-day Battle of Gettysburg on July 1-3, 1863.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Period maps have been combined with a fresh battlefield examination by George Anderson.  The maps portray Bliss Farm and MacPherson's Ridge, two intensely fought-over battle sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each hex represents 50 yards of terrain and each game turn represents about 90 seconds of real time. Personnel units represent officers, couriers, color guards (6-8 men), artillery crews, and cavalry and infantry units (approximately 20-25 men). Each gun or vehicle counter represents one artillery piece or horse-drawn vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenarios will cover action on McPherson's Ridge on Day 1, and at the Bliss Farm over Days 2 and 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
