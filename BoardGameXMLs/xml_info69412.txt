			<description>A card game with gaming money. Bluff the value of the cards to gain a million.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Players randomly draw cards containing different values. they then declare the value of the card, either the real value or bluffing. If the claim is not challenged by any other player, the active player received the amount of money he declared from the bank. &lt;br/&gt;If it is challenged (called) and the player was bluffing, he needs to pay the double amount declared to the calling player. If he was not bluffing the calling player needs to pay the double amount to the active player.&lt;br/&gt;The player with most money when all the cards have been played wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
