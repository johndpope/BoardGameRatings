			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your characters were children when Terry ran. You saw him on TV, maybe you even saw him in person. He made you believe there was hope, that somewhere the hurting had to stop. Since then life has conspired to take that hope away from you. Everything you love has been lost; you&amp;rsquo;ve fallen through the cracks and are barely making ends meet. You didn&amp;rsquo;t think you had hope anymore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you&amp;rsquo;ve found Terry&amp;rsquo;s prosthetic leg, and with it a quest. You, together, have to finish the Marathon of Hope. You have to run the 3000 km from Thunder Bay to Victoria, British Columbia. Even though you aren&amp;rsquo;t athletes, even though the leg is stolen and getting caught with it means prison, even though it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even make any sense &amp;ndash; you know you have to do this. This is your last chance. This may be Canada&amp;rsquo;s last chance. This is hope, for better or worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
