It deals with their roles in the economic order of the world.&amp;quot; (translated from Swedish)&lt;br/&gt;Players assume the position of either a poor, semi-poor or a rich country, or even that of a multinational corporation.

In the second phase some rules are changed in favor of the poor countries. In the third phase the players are to make rules that are fair to all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also an earlier version of the game called V&amp;auml;rlds-Monopol, with the only difference being the name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the manual, the game has been published in Swedish, Danish, Norse and English. Even Finnish rules can be found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
