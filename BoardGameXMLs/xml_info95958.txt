			<description>Ridge Racer 3D (リッジレーサー3D, Rijji Rēsā 3D) is a racing video game for the Nintendo 3DS which is developed by Namco Bandai Games. First images of the game were leaked in early November 2010, and Namco confirmed that the video game was going to be released later on in 2011. However, it was later revealed to be a launch title, and was released in Japan on February 26, 2011 and in North America on March 22, 2011, five days prior to the launch of the Nintendo 3DS itself in that region. Ridge Racer 3D is also set to be released in Europe on March 25.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ridge Racer 3D&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
