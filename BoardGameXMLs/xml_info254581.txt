			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of friends have come to Chicago to attend a three-day convention in celebration of their favorite weird-fiction author, Harrison Paul Likenstuff. The weekend consists of mostly of sessions discussing Likenstuff&amp;rsquo;s work and games based on the characters and monsters created by Likenstuff in his stories. The highlight of the convention is a film festival of fan-created shorts inspired by Likenstuff&amp;rsquo;s work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After two full days of a fun and exciting convention, the friends attend the screening of a highly-anticipated fan film called Legs. But what has been a harmless and enjoyable weekend getaway quickly turns into a terrifying race to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legs is a modern-day Scenario for 4 to 6 Investigators which can usually be run in a single gaming session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an updated version of Legs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
