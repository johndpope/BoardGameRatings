			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;We summoned it with our malice. We made it grow by the strength of our hatred. We let it stay because we can&amp;rsquo;t change our very natures. Nothing can force humans to commit acts of evil, only endow us with powers to indulge in our own sadistic proclivities. It&amp;rsquo;s all around us, on every news channel and in every paper. The vile nature of man is evident. Some of us kill our parents and forsake our children, greed is our creed and instant gratification our pastime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no God; there is no heaven or hell. There is only the ancient darkness and the evil of man. Hope is fleeting and grace is no longer in our grasp. We gave the darkness a form and a realm of its own. It wishes to feed upon us but now some parts of it want more. Humankind has taught it to relish in the suffering of others in a way only humans can. Enter Noctum, an inner tale of survival horror. There is nothing more evil than your fellow man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
