							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horrors of Penance</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Forge is known as a place of extremes - a place where even the most mundane sensation evokes a new impression into one&amp;rsquo;s psyche. While rarely spoken of, fear is no less heightened on the Forge, and to experience this sensation while within one of the Seven Domains is to invite mind-freezing and soul-searing terror into one&amp;rsquo;s being. &lt;br/&gt;Horrors of Penance delves into and captures this dread in the form of two chilling tales of impenetrable darkness that feature bizarre murders, spine-riveting suspense, ancient curses gone awry, hordes of the living dead, horrific torture, and much, much more! If your characters (or players) have a specific fear, chances are Horrors of Penance will not only bring it screaming to the surface of their souls, but also thrust it - raw and bloody - into their faces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horrors of Penance, penned by the authors of the introductory Oathbound&amp;reg; adventure, Dark Welcomes, contains two complete adventures: Craving Darkness, for 10th level characters; and Totem, for 17th level heroes. Further, Horrors of Penance provides no less than thirteen new ideas for horror-themed adventures or campaigns that are detailed for the Oathbound Campaign Setting, but could easily be adapted for any campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
