			<description>Star Worlds is a collectible card game, where a player takes a role of a commander of a space fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player starts the game with a base and 50-card deck. The base can produce certain types of units, which in turn can produce other types of units. In addition to this a player can play characters and put light spaceships directly into play from his or her hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spaceships can be divided into many categories: some of them can attack other spaceships, other recover used cards or cover key units from enemy fire, deliver ammunition onto the battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has gathered enough units, he or she can attack their opponent&amp;rsquo;s base. If the player&amp;rsquo;s base is destroyed, the other player wins the game. Another way to win the game is to collect twelve strategic points, produced by strategic objects. The third way includes the defense of the base until the opponent will run out of cards in their deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creator and designer of the game is Vladimir Kravchenko.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first set consists from 110 cards, 55 for each of two factions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
