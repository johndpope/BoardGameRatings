			<description>The King is old. The kingdom is divided and the great Wizard Morcai is mustering an army atop Fire Castle. From every town in the land the call goes out for heroes to take up the quest for the Five Weapons of Power. Ancient artifacts of immense power capable of giving their wielder the power to be...king! You must heed this call but your quest will not be easy. You must leave your home with only a small supply of modest provisions and brave the Overland's dangers as you seek news and information of the Five Weapons of Power. Along the way you will brave harsh weather, get lost in unfamiliar terrain, encounter powerful and sometimes hostile strangers, enter new towns, visit great castles, make loyal friends and do deeds that will make you a legend. And only if you survive all that will you be worthy to vie for one of the Five Weapons of Power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Journey To The Overland is a solo tabletop role playing game where you assume the role of a lone traveler journeying throughout the Overland in search of Five Weapons of Power. Play begins in your hometown which will be determined by the race you choose for your character &amp;ndash; human, dwarf, elf or native Overlander. From there you will determine your character starting characteristics, starting equipment and first daily action. Each day you must select a daily action that will either involve traveling, resting, working, training or visiting towns and castles to obtain news and information with the ultimate goal being to track down one of the five legendary weapons with the power to make you King!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this revised 2nd Edition of Journey To The Overland the core rulebook has been completely reorganized for easier reference.  The rules themselves have been expanded to include all new content for Kings Harbor (News &amp;amp; Information, Tavern, Audience with the Harbormaster); new taverns, an expanded supply and equipment table, new distinct News and Information for each town or castle; optional Encumbrance rules to replace the seldom used 'weight' rules; new jobs; a new race (Halflings), a new section on 'Feats', new NPCs, an expanded Ocean Encounter Table, revised rules for falling unconscious and new audience tables for Audiences with King Overlord and the King Thorond of Dwarfhaven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
