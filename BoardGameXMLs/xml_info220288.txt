							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">House of Whispers</name>
									
			<description>England, 1940. Claire and her little brother James flee the bombing of London to stay in their late grandparents' abandoned mansion in the countryside. During their first night in the house Claire wakes to find James missing. As she searcges for him she begins to realize the house is haunted, but luckily the spirits are not all bent on doing harm. The ghosts of her ancestors are there to whisper into her ear the dangers that lie ahead so she that may avoid them and find James.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;House of Whispers is a cooperative game in which one person plays Claire and the rest play the friendly spirits. As a spirit, communicate what information you can to Claire. As Claire, you must make the right decisions to avoid the terrors of the house and save your little brother!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game all players choose one word. The spirits communicate to Claire with facial expressions and by saying their word in such a way to communicate any information they can about the cards they draw. For example, if your word is &amp;quot;beware&amp;quot; and you draw a zombie, you might say &amp;quot;beeewwaarrre&amp;quot; in a slow grating voice while rolling your eyes and fixing a dead stare on your face. Claire may then decide if she wants to run from this threat or push on and try to deal with it as she searches for James.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Search the house for clues as to James' whereabouts and discover items that may help you locate him. You must save James before 8 rounds are up, otherwise he will be lost to the house forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
