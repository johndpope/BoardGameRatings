			<description>T&amp;rsquo;was 9 minutes to takeoff and all round the castle,&lt;br/&gt;Elves were scurrying about dealing with hassles.&lt;br/&gt;Bernard, the head elf, screamed out in fear,&lt;br/&gt;4 undone tasks might cancel Christmas this year.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;9 minutes &amp;lsquo;til Christmas! You, you, you and you,&lt;br/&gt;Listen to me now, I will tell you what to do.&lt;br/&gt;Get 4 bolts to repair Santa&amp;rsquo;s sleigh,&lt;br/&gt;It can&amp;rsquo;t land on rooftops with a broken runner, OK?&lt;br/&gt;Get 24 cups of flour to the baker right now,&lt;br/&gt;Some of the Gingerbread men were mistakenly shipped to Fuzhou.&lt;br/&gt;8 golden bells from the reindeer harness are missing,&lt;br/&gt;Please get this fixed before the Big Man has a hissy.&lt;br/&gt;From Santa&amp;rsquo;s red coat, 4 buttons are lost,&lt;br/&gt;We must find and replace them, whatever the cost.&lt;br/&gt;These things must be done, but a bad storm is near.&lt;br/&gt;If we can&amp;rsquo;t do them all in 9 minutes, there will be NO Christmas this year!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Ready for the challenge, the team sprang to its work. . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9 Minutes to Takeoff is a cooperative game for 2 &amp;ndash; 4 people, ages 8 &amp;ndash; Adult, lasting 30 to 60 minutes. This game was designed as an entry in the BoardGameGeek.com 2010 Christmas Print and Play Game contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your team of North Pole denizens must work together to prevent the greatest tragedy of all time: No Christmas. A blizzard is heading for the North Pole and snow is making certain areas impassible. To win you must work together as a group to clear the snow around Santa&amp;rsquo;s Castle so that you can complete the four required tasks and return to the castle by flying reindeer before time runs out. If however, the countdown clock runs out before you can complete your tasks, there will be no Christmas and Everyone, Everywhere will lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
