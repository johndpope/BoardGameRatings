							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Great Shakespearean Deaths: Card-Game</name>
									
			<description>A card game depicting various deaths that occur in Shakespeare's work. Each card shows an illustration of a Shakespearean death (illustrated by Chris Riddell) and a number of categories: Speed of Death, Gore &amp;amp; Brutality, Fairness, Piteousness, Dramatic Quality and Last Words. Each category is accompanied by a value from one to ten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two to five players are dealt all the cards and hold their hand with only one card visible on top of their deck. The game is played in rounds. The current first player chooses a category. The round winner is the holder of the card that shows the highest value for the chosen category on all the currently visible cards. The round winner adds all the visible cards to their hand and everyone turns over a new card. The winner of the round then chooses the next category. The winner of the game is the first player to hold all of the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
