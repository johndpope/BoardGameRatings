			<description>From the publishers web site:&lt;br/&gt;Skeletons Closet is revealing board game where players share their dark secrets, likes and dislikes, and thoughts with other players. In turn, each player draws cards, which are written in either the objects, people or attitudes. The players set the order they want the card to be in and the other players try to guess what that order is. Most correctly guessed, the player can move around the board faster than others! The player who manages to evade the game board first, wins, but ... win was his to keep at least one skeleton to reveal his own closet!&lt;br/&gt;Skeletons Closet is a party game where winner must share a one secret, but losers has to do a lot more....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
