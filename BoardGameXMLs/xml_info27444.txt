			<description>This Scrabble-like game is made in India and is for 2 to 4 players, with a solo game option. Like Scrabble, players draw 7 tiles from a pool of 100 (including two blanks) and try to form words, crossword fashion, on a 16 by 16 square grid. The board includes bonus squares that double, triple or quadruple the word score. There are also squares that allow the player an extra turn. Scores are based on the number of letters in the word - the letters do not have differing point values: they are all worth one point each, except for blanks, which are worth nothing but can be used to represent any letter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
