			<description>From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;2-6 persons can take part in this funny dexterity game. It is about gaining points by fishing sticks from a heap by means of a magnetic stick, which requires a steady hand, good memory and a sharp eye.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple Pick Up Sticks variant with magnetic sticks. Every stick is magnetic at only one end. You may continue to try to get one of the sticks as long as you can pull a stick out of the heap.  You lose your turn either by choosing an nonmagnetic end of a stick or being by having chosen a stick which is too heavy for the magnet to pull out. At the end of the game every stick you got counts points according to its color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
