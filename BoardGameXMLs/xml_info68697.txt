							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">E.N. Guild Vol. 6: Thieves&#039; Guild</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It all started as a joke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Calling the group of cutthroats and cutpurses, bruisers and burglars, leg breakers and loan sharks a &amp;quot;guild&amp;quot; started as a joke somewhere back in the day. It was a flippant comment by someone whose name has long been forgotten, a sarcastic comment comparing the house of rogues to a legitimate establishment like the merchants' guild or the messengers' guild. The comment managed to insult both, the thieves and the businessmen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Somehow, the name stuck and now organized groups of thieves are inevitably called thieves' guilds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many thieves' guilds have been described in broad strokes, and they are all too often described like Fagin's band of little thieves from Oliver Twist. This book takes a different approach and is more inspired by movies like Road to Perdition and The Godfather.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Information about thieves' guilds, including common terms they use, the thieves' code, and the various ranks within their guilds.&lt;br/&gt;     Two new uses for the Bluff and Perform skills&lt;br/&gt;     4 new feats&lt;br/&gt;     new Prestige Classes&lt;br/&gt;     3 new spells, and 3 new magical items&lt;br/&gt;     Layout, and outside look at a blacksmith shop used as a safe house by a thieves' guild&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
