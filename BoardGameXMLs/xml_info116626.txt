			<description>From Publisher Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Axle tribes is the game of automotive combat set within a post apocalyptic world. Please note, that this is a game for the gamers - it is not for profit, nor will it ever be. In addition, the rules will literally be shaped by the players - each new edition will contain rule changes and additions that are suggested by YOU. Please feel free to jot down any ideas as you play and submit them to the Drunk Dwarves webmaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And without further delay - we present our first published game: AXLE TRIBES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Earth has been blighted. Long ago an event, the great end, turned the world as we knew it into a smitten landscape of broken glass and twisted jungles of metal rod. All that was green and blue, has been reborn in hues of dead browns. The air tastes bad - and it's hard to believe we were ever meant to live here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between the endless stretches of waste there are monstrous cities ruled by powerful land lords, where the land still clings to life. But if you live there, you live their way - or not at all. That's why many of us band together and try to survive in the wastes of the bad lands - among the mutant freaks and the harsh ever-present sun. The Axle Tribes rule this land, that is - everything left worth ruling. The Axle Tribes fight, they fight over food, water, and the parts needed to make and maintain our steeds. I am a warrior, my steed is my life, and the life of my tribe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Description Notes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This free set of miniatures rules is meant to be played with Hot Wheels (or similar) model cars on the table top. (Serious players often customize their vehicles with weapons, armor-plating, etc.) Both players control a Tribe and each is allowed to build a set amount of vehicles (called Steeds) to fight it out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players work within an agreed upon dollar cap to create a variety of vehicles. Various weapons and vehicle upgrades make each Steed more distinctive, but also add to the cost. The game progresses in Turns. (During a Turn each vehicle is activated once.) Vehicles may move, fire, etc. when activated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten-sided dice are used as a randomizer to decide control rolls, to hit rolls, etc. Maneuvers are based on 45 degree turns. There are special rules for collisions. Each steed has its own record sheet where damage is recorded. Printable counters are included to help track damage and speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The victory conditions of the game are left up to the players. A total destruction match in which only one side is left standing is the simplest way to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
