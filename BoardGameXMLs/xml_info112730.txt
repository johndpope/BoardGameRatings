							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The DUDE Game System</name>
									
			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Diceless:&lt;br/&gt;    DUDE uses regular playing cards for task resolution instead of the dice common in other games, and by holding different-sized hands, each player has more or less control over the results of their actions, rather than being at the mercy of blind chance. &lt;br/&gt;Universal:&lt;br/&gt;    DUDE can theoretically represent any genre. However, it does work best at fast action-adventure stories or freeform dramatic gaming; complex mechanical simulation of a world is not within DUDE's abilities. &lt;br/&gt;Determination:&lt;br/&gt;    DUDE uses a unified task system to handle all actions. And unlike other (overly-complex) games, it doesn't waste your time trying to remember which stat affects a task. &lt;br/&gt;Engine:&lt;br/&gt;    DUDE is only the basic mechanics of an RPG - you will need to acquire or write a setting book. See The Alan Smithee Project for an example of what needs to be developed in such a book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
