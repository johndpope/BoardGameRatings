			<description>Pocket Imperium: Mech Worlds is a promo tile for Pocket Imperium, it adds more variety and a different way to take advantage of Expand and Explore actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just before placing the 6 standard sector tiles around Tri-Prime, randomly select one to remove, and replace it with the Mech World sector tile. Complete the rest of game setup normally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yellow Mech Worlds&lt;br/&gt;These systems have been completely taken over by self-replicating machines that will help whoever is controlling them to rapidly construct fleets. If, during the execution of an Expand action, a player adds one or more ships in a hex containing a yellow Mech World, 1 additional ship (if available) may be added. Yellow Mech Worlds have a system value of 0. This means that 0 points are scored for controlling them during the Exploit phase and only 1 ship may remain there at the end of a round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blue Mech Worlds&lt;br/&gt;Endowed with life forms that thrive in the low-density atmosphere of these worlds, these systems and their launch facilities allow fleets that launch from them to rapidly reach deep space. If, during the execution of an Explore action, a player begins movement of a fleet from a blue Mech World, the fleet being moved may move 1 additional hex this turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
