							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Old Church</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Old Church adventure takes place in the Sunset Mountains, south of Darkhold in the Sword Coast of the Forgotten Realms. The ideal party size for the following adventure is 4 player characters of 3rd level.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;The Old Church was built long ago. Under the vision of a priest whose name has been lost to the ages. Those that fell into his beliefs believed that when the world was near its end and the sun would set for the last time, they would be the chosen ones and would take shelter within the walls of the church as a way of saving themselves from the destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
