			<description>Flip City: Wilderness is a standalone sequel to the mircrodeckbuilding game, Flip City. It can be played by itself, or combined with the original for more variety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The citizens of Flip City want to get away from it all. It's up to you to develop the perfect retreat for your citizens. But be careful, develop too quickly and it will feel too much like home!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this deck-building game, you have no hand at all; instead, you play cards directly from the top of your deck. Each card is double-sided, with each side granting different special bonuses. Winning the game requires delicate strategies... and some luck as well!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, they play cards directly from the top of their deck to acquire cash and victory points. They may continue playing cards as long as they have fewer than three &amp;quot;unhappiness&amp;quot; icons in play; if they do get three such icons, their turn ends immediately. If they stop before they get three &amp;quot;unhappiness&amp;quot; icons, they can use their cash to either buy a new card or flip over a card they already own, transforming it into a new, upgraded card. Upgraded cards typically grant more cash and VP as well as the option to flip them back to their non-upgraded side in exchange for an extra bonus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player gains eight or more VP in a single turn, the player wins immediately!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
