			<description>BuildaBeast is a card game where you get to create cool creatures. Your goal is to craft powerful beasts by buying head, body, and tail cards. But beware, if you play too many body cards without a tail, you&amp;rsquo;ll bust! Players buy cards and build beasts until the supply of new cards is exhausted. Then the players tally the cards they have gained to see who has the most victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
