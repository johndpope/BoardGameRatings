							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thermal Bath</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The large thermal bath is a center of the town's social life. At its many pools anyone with the coin to spare will try to make an impression. Many a business deal or a marriage has been arranged in the relaxing water or beyond the curtains dividing the room on the loungers as well. A visit to the bath can be anything from relaxing to exciting. It can even be profitable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bath itself consists of many pools, surrounded by rows of column, balustrades and curtains suspended in between. The pools range from hot to cold but are in general not too deep. At their circumference bathers can seat and even at their center one can easily stand. While some loungers made from polished wood are provided in any room most bathers will lie on the marble of the floor as numerous pipes lead hot water or in some cases even steam through the floor giving it a comfortable warmth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
