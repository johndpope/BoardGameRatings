			<description>32 Dice is a clever combination of strategy and classic chess-checkers play. Roll 16 dice to set up your board...flip to a different number to alter your move and be the first to move one of your die to the opposite side of the board to win. It is a clever new board game...easy to learn, and with loads of challenge for the more serious strategy players. First player to maneuver one of their dice to their opponent's back line wins. What will your strategy be... to take your opponent's dice, or defend the back line? A strategic flip of the dice instantly alters the direction and outcome of every game. Addictively fun for players of all ages. &lt;br/&gt;Wooden 4-piece game board is modular and stores neatly inside wooden box along with game dice. &amp;bull;Contents: Wooden storage box&lt;br/&gt; &amp;bull;1 4-piece game board &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;32 dice: 16 dark &amp;amp; 16 light &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;1 Rule book. &lt;br/&gt;For those who enjoy chess or checkers, this game is almost a must-have for your collection.
