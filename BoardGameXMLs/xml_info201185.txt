							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vampire: The Eternal Struggle â€“ Final Nights</name>
									
			<description>Final Nights is the second expansion set for Vampire: The Eternal Struggle to be published by White Wolf. This expansion set focuses on the independent clans, although some new material is also featured for the clans of the Camarilla. Like the preceding set, Sabbat War, this expansion set covers some territory previously covered by Wizards of the Coast's expansion sets, in this case Dark Sovereigns and Ancient Hearts. As fits the set's theme, the four preconstructed starter decks for Final Nights each focus on one of the four independent clans: Assamites, Followers of Set, Giovanni, and Ravnos. Many cards from the earlier Wizards of the Coast-produced V:TES sets are reprinted in these preconstructed decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
