							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great Wall Of Mexico</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are proud to present our game &amp;quot;The Great Wall of Mexico&amp;quot; with your favorite, and maybe not-so-favorite characters. This is a game of fun and surprises, and an epic battle to build or destroy a wall between Mexico and the United States of America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than anything else, this is a game full of humor that will make you and your friends laugh. This is a simple game, and you don't have to know anything about or even care about politics to enjoy this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with a wall half built (or half destroyed if you will). If all the bricks are in place - team orange wins. If all the bricks are gone - team green wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bricks are added or removed after every round, depending on which team wins. The card values are added together and if the score is above zero 0 the green team wins and removes a brick. If not - the orange team does and adds one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
