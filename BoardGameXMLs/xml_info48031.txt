			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Christmas time is a magical time ... more magical than you might expect!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During those twelve magical days, gingerbread men awaken, given life by the magic of the Oven and Mother Baker. They rush around your home, having adventures, getting in and out of trouble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And there is a lot of trouble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's the nasty cat who loves to torment Gingerbread Men, the helpful (but hungry) dog who's doing his best not to gobble up his new-found little friends, and the King of the Rats who steals the family's presents. The Oracle atop the refrigerator dispenses dangerous wisdom and the Cookiesmith repairs damaged cookies ... but always for a favor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And there's that persistent rumor about a man named &amp;quot;Santa&amp;quot; who shows up on Christmas Eve - just when Gingerbread Magic is about to expire - and takes good Cookies to the North Pole where it's Christmas all the time ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Secret Lives of Gingerbread Men is a family-style roleplaying game designed for gamers of all ages. The system is easy enough for a beginner to learn and deep enough to challenge experienced players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Christmas, discover the secret. The Secret Lives of Gingerbread Men!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
