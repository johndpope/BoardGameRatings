							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Desert Ruins</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago this castle buried under the desert's sand was one of many small fortifications guarding a caravan route running along the outskirts of a large desert. And while it withstood raiders and wars it had no chance against the ravages of time. Ever so slowly it was covered by the encroaching wandering dunes of the desert. Despite the best efforts of the garrison the castle's well fell dry, filled with sand and thus the castle had to be abandoned to be slowly covered by sand. Today as the large wandering dunes have passed what little remains of the castle has surfaced again, not much more than a small landmark among the endless dunes of the desert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
