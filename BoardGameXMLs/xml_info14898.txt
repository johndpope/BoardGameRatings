			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        CANCELLED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         The information that BGG has on this item indicates that The Adventure League will not enter production.  This entry currently serves as a placeholder for the announced item and will likely later be removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher, Quest Machine:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the early 20th century THE ADVENTURE LEAGUE is formed by Lord Rex Hunter. This society of treasure hunters, adventure seekers, and artifact collectors gathers men from around the world to share their tales of glory. Each runs a global network, questing for fame, wealth, and the prestige of their home country. Together they pursue a cult that would use the powerful relics for evil, but each adventurer wants the victory to be his alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players follow clues and try to collect all the pieces of an ancient artifacts by strategically deploying their forces and gaining majorities in forgotten territories like El Dorado, Atlantis, and Shangri-La. Leading each team are world famous heroes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LORD REX HUNTER - Reginald Hunter was heir to a Lordship in Great Britain. His parents were chemists who were doing research in Africa when the family was lost to Ivory poachers. Years later, Rex turned up in the UK with the adventurous spirit and intelligence of his parents and the savage power of his jungle upbringing. He started THE ADVENTURE LEAGUE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DRAGON PRINCE - A true member of Eastern aristocracy, the Jade Dragon, as some call him, was never content to sit on his riches. He uses it to help those in need and for his globe-spanning adventures to recover lost artifacts of great wealth and power. Best friend of Lord Rex Hunter, but also his fiercest competitor, the Dragon Prince was the first to join his LEAGUE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DOC ROCKET - &amp;quot;Doc Rocket&amp;quot; is Dr. Werner Von Bronz, one of the greatest scientists of 1920's Germany. He is a physicist, adventurer, and archeologist who scours the globe looking for ancient technologies to incorporate into his gadgets. He is a former WWI fighter pilot of great courage and nobility, loyal to both his own Germany and the LEAGUE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE WRAITH - All that is know about his previous life is that he was a police officer in a large American city on a crusade against organized crime. He now fights crime on a global scale with relentless energy and sharp focus. Some say he cannot die. His devoted followers supply him with the scientific and financial resources he needs to carry on his campaign for justice, within and outside of the LEAGUE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
