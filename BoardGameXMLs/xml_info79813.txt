			<description>As a digger you try to find as many nuggets as your fate will be allowed. Its a lucky dice game for 3 to 4 persons. You start with less equipment, but you believe in your fate. The run to the claims begins, chance fields and chance cards are on your way. You can buy a donkey or you can work (temporarily) with your opponents together, you can choose safe long ways or risky short ways. &lt;br/&gt;The first player, who arrives at a claim, get 2/3 of the claim, the next player the rest.&lt;br/&gt;Who can collect the most nuggets, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
