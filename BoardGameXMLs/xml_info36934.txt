							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shakeout</name>
									
			<description>Denys Fisher had a reputation for producing some very 'different' games - not least Shakeout which involves each player taking hold of a plastic sphere filled with plastic sticks,  and having to shake it frantically to 'spill' out the contents.   These are then subsequently placed in various combinations upon a plastic scoreboard in a race to create the maximum points.  The first Player to empty his 'sphere' and score the most is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An unusual game, and one that is so simple it is consequently overlooked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;c1971&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
