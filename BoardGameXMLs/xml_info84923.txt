			<description>The game board shows shelves with pairs of item. One of each pair is eco-friendly (and has a green dot), the other isn't (and has a red dot). The items are also depicted on tiles, and there are 15 additional garbage tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The item tiles are placed face-down around the game board. The active player flips open a tile. If the depicted item is covered by a garbage tile on the board, the turn ends - but if it is a tile with a red dot, another item in the shelves has to be covered. If the item is still free, another tile can be flipped open. If the two tiles form a pair, the green-dotted card is put on a shelf , the red one is discarded. Also, a garbage tile can be removed from the board. If the two tiles don't match, the player has to cover all red-dotted items s/he just flipped open with garbage tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all items with green dots are covered with item tiles, the game ends. If there are still garbage cards on the shelves, all players lose. If not, everyone wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
