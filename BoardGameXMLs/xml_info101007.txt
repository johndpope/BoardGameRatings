			<description>&amp;quot;FQ3&amp;quot; is a board game that recreates the world of the car races. With a mixture of strategy, action, control of risk, and some touches of role, FQ3 represents a real way (and funny too), all that happens inside and outside of the tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;FQ3&amp;quot; has 3 difficulty levels of rules to satisfy all kind of players;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- BASIC RULES: Aimed at casual and undemanding gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- ADVANCED RULES: For fans of race games. These rules are more realistic, and involved all sorts of factors: such as types of tires, fuel loads, setting the car, kers, yellow flag, Safety Car, moral of drivers and injuries, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- MANAGER MODE: Only for those who  drink gasoline! In this game mode, in addition to the role of pilot, you will assume the role of team manager. You will manage the economy, hiring drivers, sponsors, engineers, desing the car and evolve it. The years pass and drivers will gain experience and they will improve their skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUMMARY OF GAMEPLAY: The Friday of the GP, the player must decide the strategy (number of stops, tires, and fuel load).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Saturday, will be held the pole position, it follows a mathematical operation involving various modifiers (skills of the pilot, car performance, fuel load, tires, moral, blunders, and a roll of 1d20).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The race takes place the Sunday.&lt;br/&gt;The circuit is composed of squares. The cars will go moving by circuit as many squares as the speed (gear dependent) of your car.&lt;br/&gt;When the cars reach the corners, the drivers must brake and accelerate. Brakes and accelerates with a d100. Drivers have an ability to Brake and Accelerate that used to take curves (higher or lower depending on driver).&lt;br/&gt;These skills will be modified by the fuel load, tire types, and how close you decide to brake and accelerate.&lt;br/&gt;The risk you take in the curves is important; you can take away your opponents, but be careful!, fail brake roll or acceleration roll will damage your car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game stands on four pillars:&lt;br/&gt;The driver, the car, the pit stop mechanics, and the circuit.&lt;br/&gt;Each of them has many different skills, qualities or details that make it different from the others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a brief summary of how to play. There are many and funny rules, such as kers, spin, overtaking, blunders, drivers' virtues, drive's defects, safety car,etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
