			<description>The Roots of Magic is a tabletop miniatures game of duels between competing wizards in fantasy world. Players activate their wizards to perform mundane actions such as movement as well as casting spells and using other special abilities. The goal of the game varies depending on the scenario chosen and there might be multiple paths to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played with a single wizard per player or the players may decide to use additional models such as apprentices and animal companions for a larger game. Individual scenarios may also add neutral monsters to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game rules are published online and the models are sold individually. Each model has their own card listing their various abilities. Players may add also tabletop terrain to the game from their collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
