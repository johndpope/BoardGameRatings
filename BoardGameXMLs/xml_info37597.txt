			<description>Hekumanhuippu (engl. Climax) is an erotic game for two lovers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll a die and move on a board with separate tracks for both towards the end, the climax. The tracks consist of four kind of points: Truth, Dare, Strip and Volcano. When a player enters a point (s)he must draw a corresponding action card from a pile, read it aloud and perform the given action. Some actions are quite innocuous, some bolder (especially in the endgame).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On both tracks there are a few points where players have to take a longer reroute, throw a die again or stop (ie. perform no action). If a player throws a six, (s)he must take six steps backwards making the game last even longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player to reach the end (climax) first is the winner. (S)he may choose the prize or players can decide it together beforehand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;-Game board&lt;br/&gt;-47 Truth cards&lt;br/&gt;-45 Dare cards&lt;br/&gt;-12 Strip cards&lt;br/&gt;-19 Volcano cards&lt;br/&gt;-Two pawns&lt;br/&gt;-A die&lt;br/&gt;-Rules printed at the bottom of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
