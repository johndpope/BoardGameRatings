							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fantasy Adventurers</name>
									
			<description>This is a light weight 'filler' strategy game where you explore dungeons, kill things, take their stuff, return to town, heal your party, gain some levels, then start all over again with an even harder dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's basically the stereotypical fantasy RPG done up as a strategy game where you manage a party of characters rather than role play a single character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasy Adventurers is designed to be a light, simple and quick two-player game that can be played almost anywhere, but includes rules for solo play and three players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the game rules you will need a sheet of paper, something to write with and a single d20.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is only available as a PDF download and includes these PDF files: Adventurers Guide, Game Play Guide, Dungeon Builders Guide, and Character Sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
