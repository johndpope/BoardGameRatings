			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, characters are all leaders of a city in the interior of prehistoric Africa.  Characters compete with each other to become the greatest leader; play involves a structured process of establishing tasks and then attempting to complete them while other players use a bidding process to interfere.  One player, termed Africa (the game master) oversees the process and enforces the rules, as well as providing the standard campaign elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was entered after the legal time, but nevertheless was allowed because the forum had apparently suffered significant downtime during the final hours of the competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
