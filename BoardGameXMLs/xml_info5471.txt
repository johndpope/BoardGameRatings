			<description>The object of this game is to accumulate status.  You do this by trading your Ford up to a Rolls, Mercedes or Cadillac, by dining at the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; places and, of course, by spending extravagantly.  Each player starts with a credit line of 25 k$ (cash being too tacky for this game); you win by gaining 500 status point *and* having at least 10 k$ left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You move about town (the board is a simplified street map of Beverly Hills) and follow the instructions of Status, Bank and Jet Set cards.  When you reach the Gold Streets, you get to patronize various establishments, where you spend money and spin the Status Wheel (which directs you to instruction booklets).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box is lined with a fake velvet which leaves tiny short hairs everywhere.  Eeek.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
