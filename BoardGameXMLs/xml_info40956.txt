			<description>[From back of the box]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are sixty individual &amp;quot;Footballer&amp;quot; cards in the set and an equal number of these cards are dealt to each player in a clockwise direction. Two players receive 30 cards each, three players 20 cards and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the game is to secure all of your opponent's cards whilst retaining your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dealer, or Player One, has &amp;quot;Possession&amp;quot; and he begins by reading aloud he name of the player on his first card, together with the single statistic that he believes will prove superior to the corresponding statistic on his opponent's card ie: &amp;quot;Alex Jesaulenko - Goals 434&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player Two responds by reading aloud the corresponding statistic on his first card ie: &amp;quot;Leigh Matthews - Goal 915&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since Player Two's card has trumped Player One's, Player One hands his Alex Jesaulenko card to Player Two, who together with his Leigh Matthews card, places it on the bottom of his deck. These cards will in turn come into play again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Player Two has won the hand, he secures &amp;quot;Possession&amp;quot; and reading from his next card might continue with &amp;quot;Bill Picken - Games 240&amp;quot; and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player Two retains &amp;quot;Possession&amp;quot; as long as he continues to win each hand, securing his opponents cards. The moment he loses a hand, &amp;quot;Possession&amp;quot; reverts to Player One and so on until either player has secured all of his opponent's cards and is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
