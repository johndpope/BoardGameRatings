							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dirty Feet</name>
									
			<description>Step into the wacky world of Dirty Feet, where learning to measure is neat! Players roll the silly feet and inch dice, add up their length, and then race to find a matching combination of cards in their hand. Zany action cards help players change their roll's value, adding to the fast-paced fun. As players make matches, they collect corresponding inch tokens, then convert them to feet and yard tokens when they've accumulated enough. But, be careful - don't roll two dirty feet, or you'll lose tokens! Perfect for home and school. Includes feet dice, inch dice, 48 measurement cards, 20 action cards, 1 conversion card, 13 feet tokens, 40 inchworm tokens, and 24 yard tokens. For 2 to 6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
