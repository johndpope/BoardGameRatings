							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Slayer&#039;s Guide to Amazons</name>
									
			<description>Hell Hath No Fury&lt;br/&gt;Throughout history and legend, amazons have always stood firm as the ultimate warrior women, the ideal of female triumph in a male dominated world. But who are the amazons, a race who counts the deepest jungles as their domain and ruthlessly slays any intruder? The Slayer&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Amazons peels back the fog of myth and legend to reveal, for the very first time, the true story of these incredible women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With lithe, supple bodies and stunningly attractive features, the amazons are deceptive to any outsider encountering them for the very first time. Few make any mistake the second time around if they survive this encounter, for amazons are truly cruel and capricious, dedicated to destroying any influence the outside world may have upon their civilisation. Far from being primitive tribeswomen, amazons have a highly sophisticated culture, devoted to the preservation of their warrior ideals at all costs. They are superb combatants, for skill in the sword, spear and bow is impressed upon each girl at an early age, and they ruthlessly protect their domain against invader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
