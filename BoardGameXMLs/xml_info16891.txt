							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Corvette</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Corvette&amp;quot; bills itself as &amp;quot;the automobile maintenance and trading game.&amp;quot; However, it somehow feels more like a Chevy advertising piece, as each player progresses from owning a Cavalier through a Celebrity, Caprice, and Camaro in their quest to be the first to own a Corvette and be free of debt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-6 players compete in an admittedly simplistic game: collect money by passing &amp;quot;payday&amp;quot;, then hope to avoid spending it all on car maintenance in order to buy a better car. Judicious selection of which &amp;quot;pick up&amp;quot; cards (coupons and special board advance cards) to keep in one's hand add a little strategy to an otherwise &amp;quot;roll and move&amp;quot; style game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
