							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Peoni: Irreproachable Order</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Irreproachable Order is the clerical order for men in the Peonian Church. Its basic mission is to ease hardship in the lives of the poor and afflicted through agriculture and healing. The Irreproachable Order also seeks to combat the mental and spiritual causes of illness, a specialization that addresses the needs of those who are soul-sick, accursed, or possessed. In addition to covering the order's history and present situation, the article details how one joins and lives in the order and describes the equipment and invocations used by its members. Also included are descriptions, equipment, and invocations of two specialist subgroups in the order: the battlefield healers in the Sons of Tirrala and the exorcists of the Shield of Belsirasin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
