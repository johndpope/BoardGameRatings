							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Werewolves of London</name>
									
			<description>Werewolves of London is a video game released in 1987 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and the Amstrad CPC. It was released on cassette which has the Amstrad version on one side and the Spectrum version on the other (called &amp;quot;Flippy Flippy&amp;quot;). The game used the same engine as Viz Design's (consisting of Steve Howard and Paul Smith) other game Frankenstein Junior which was released by Codemasters in the same year. The game was released two years late (and largely unfinished) and was as a budget title, as intended publisher Ariolasoft went bankrupt (being released by Mastertronic. It was also released in Spain by Dro Soft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in London and the plot is to kill each of eight members of an aristocratic family who put a curse on the main character, resulting in his daily transformation into a werewolf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;The game is played from a side-on 45-degree view, letting the player not only move left and right, but up and down. The character can also jump. The player starts off as a human who must roam the streets of London (including the London Underground and Hyde Park), and pick up items which will help the player in certain tasks. When the timer hits midnight, the player character transforms into a werewolf. The player must then track down each of the 8 enemy characters and kill, and optionally, eat their bodies, while avoiding being shot or captured by the police.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game involved more strategy elements than the traditional 8-bit platform game, as the game changed mechanics and difficulty in response to the player's actions. For example, the more people that are attacked by the werewolf, the more active the police become. The Hyde Park location is locked during the night, and a ticket is needed to enter the subway (although rush gate can be done). When the Werewolf is sent to prison when 'touched' by a police officer with handcuffs. After transforms back to a human, the player is released or the player can escape by finding a crowbar to escape through the sewers (a torch is needed to see in the dark). Eating family members and NPC gives extra health, but being shot results in a constant health drop (in the form of a blood-bag icon). Finding bandages can stem the blood flow. If the blood-bag reaches empty, the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolves_of_London_%28video_game%29 Werewolves of London (video game)]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
