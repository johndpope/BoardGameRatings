							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paymi</name>
									
			<description>Paymi consist of two standard 6 sided dice and a deck of 42 cards with the picture of two rolled dice on each card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are the 36 combinations you can get from rolling two dice plus six extra cards with the doubles on them. Each player start with five cards in their hand. The dice are rolled and the first player to call out &amp;quot;Paymi&amp;quot; and place down a card that matches the combination rolled wins one chip from the other players if the combination was a double you win two chips. The first player to play all five of his card wins one additional chip from the other players for every spot on each card still in their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player has lost all of his chips and the player with the most chips wins. Adding an extra die or two can make the game a little more exciting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
