			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was a stormy night, and you and your siblings were just recovering from that nasty fever that all the children in town had. Mother had to step out to do some errands, despite the storm. And when she came back, she seemed . . . different (even though Father says that's nonsense!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to two unusual hours in the lives of the Harrington children. You and your siblings must puzzle out what has happened before bedtime, or bad things are sure to happen. Being children, the focus is on roleplaying, followed by problem solving. Readers of Edward Eager or the Narnia books will feel instantly at home . . . as will the Lovecraftian fans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
