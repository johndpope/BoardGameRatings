			<description>A board game designed by two employees of Robert Bosch (automotive parts supplier).  Players race through the countryside trying to be the first to arrive at the finish.  The board contains various terrain like mountain passes, dry deserts, and crowded cities.  Players must equip their car with various BOSCH systems (ABS, stability control, etc.) in order to pass through these areas most effectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published a year later (2001) by Piatnik with all of the BOSCH-specific notation removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
