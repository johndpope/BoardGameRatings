							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mega Campaign: Screaming Eagles</name>
									
			<description>They're coming... Hundreds of thousands of Allied troops will storm the beaches at dawn, for it is D-Day, June 6th, 1944, and you're going to lead the way. You will take on the role of Captain Nathan Howard Miller, 101st Airborne Division, the legendary &amp;quot;Screaming Eagles,&amp;quot; and your first mission will be to land behind the invasion beaches with your men. In the dark hours, just before the troops hit the beaches, you'll land with your men and secure vital roads and highways, knock out enemy guns that threaten the troops coming ashore, and then spearhead the drive to Berlin. Along the way, you'll face challenges and tasks that earned some men the nation's highest awards for courage and heroism. Can you lead your men in a bayonet charge against a fortified and determined enemy? You'll have your chance, as you recreate the charge that earned Lt. Col. Robert G. Cole the Congressional Medal of Honor. Can you rally your troops, and hold on to Bastogne, against all the Germans can throw at you? Survive long enough and you'll find out. In previous Mega Campaigns, you slogged through the steaming jungles of the South Pacific, in &amp;quot;Operation Watchtower,&amp;quot; where death waited for you behind every tree. You felt the North African heat, and the sand in your boots, in &amp;quot;Desert Fox,&amp;quot; as you fought with the legendary Afrika Korps. You rode with the Wehrmacht and faced in awe the Soviet T-34 tanks on the Eastern Front. Now you will feel the wind in your face as you leap into the darkness above Normandy, the pulse pounding terror of the deadly maze of hedgerow fighting, then the biting, bitter cold as you lead your men through the &amp;quot;Battle of the Bulge,&amp;quot; and beyond. From the desk of another legend, &amp;quot;Wild Bill&amp;quot; Wilder, comes the greatest Mega Campaign for &amp;quot;Steel Panthers: World at War&amp;quot; so far. &amp;quot;Wild Bill&amp;quot; has pulled out all the stops in creating this newest addition to the Matrix Games arsenal. Leading an elite group of historians, researchers, scenario designers, writers, and graphic and audio artists, he has woven not just one, but four complete battle threads, each with its own unique core forces, into a single product that truly earns the name MEGA Campaign. Furthermore, it makes full use of the new icons, graphics and units, only available in Steel Panthers: World at War v8.0, some of which were created especially for this Mega Campaign. Based not only on exhaustive research, historical documents, and newly declassified information, but also on interviews and conversations with actual veterans of the units portrayed, this is more than just a game, it's military history at your finger tips. Screaming Eagles 1944-45 offers you more then just some scenarios. In it you will find dozens of pictures, backgrounds, historical documents and insights into the D-Day to VE-Day campaigns, some of them only recently unearthed and declassified, plus numerous maps to guide you to your objectives. As you win (or lose) battles, a map will display them for you. For exceptional valor, you may receive special medals and awards. What is a Mega Campaign? Mega Campaigns are specially designed and programmed campaign systems for Matrix Games Steel Panthers: World at War. You must have a copy of Steel Panthers: World At War v8.0 to play the Screaming Eagles 1944-45 Mega Campaign. Mega Campaigns are non-linear; they branch into dozens of directions, depending on the victory level achieved by the player and on his choices during play. In that respect, this Mega Campaign is unique because you can play any of the four threads, and never repeat a single battle. No other Mega Campaign has ever been designed like this! In a Mega Campaign, you not only face standard attack or defend types of battles, but many unusual missions and variants will also test the limits of your wargaming skills. To say you will find yourself immersed in the campaign, and that a stand-alone battle will never feel the same again, doesn't even come close. The fact is, until you've experienced a Matrix Games Mega Campaign you might as well be playing checkers. You will find yourself immersed in the campaign and a stand-alone battle will never feel the same again. The fact is to truly get the feel of a Mega Campaign one must experience it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
