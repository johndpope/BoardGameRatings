							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mickey Go-Along Games</name>
									
			<description>This children's card game, with a Mickey Mouse travel theme, is actually four games-in-one. In the first game, players draw an outfit card and then simultaneously grab clothing cards off the table, racing to be the first to find all four articles of their characters outfit. The second game is a simple memory game where players turn over face down clothing cards trying to (once again) complete their characters outfit. In the third game, players add an item to Mickey's suitcase and must then repeat every item (in order of the ever growing sequence) that has already been packed. The forth game is a simple rummy variant in which players try to collect all four pieces of clothing for any outfit by drawing cards from the deck or asking opponents for a specific type of card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
