			<description>Materia is an alchemy themed casual card game. It is similar to other rummy-style card games that include drafting and hand management. Each round, a new set of transmutations (sets or runs) is played for everyone to see. Players must match their hand of cards to the combination the table to earn points. Other special alchemy cards create player interaction and can change the course of the round. Once a player has run out of cards, the round is over and points are awarded. The number of points to win is adjusted according to the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
