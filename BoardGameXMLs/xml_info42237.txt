			<description>The following description is mainly copied from the Wikipedia description for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Khanhoo is a non-partnership &amp;quot;draw-and-discard&amp;quot; card game which was adapted to Western taste by British diplomat William Henry Wilkinson and published by the London card maker Charles Goodall in 1891. The Chinese game from which Wilkinson got his inspiration was called Kanhu and seems to have been widespread in China in the second half of the nineteenth century.&lt;br/&gt;As it is a card game of the Rummy family, the object of the game is to get rid of all cards by melding them. The first player to do so is granted 5 points and the first to reach 50 wins the match, which can be achieved in two, three or four rounds of games.&lt;br/&gt;t was first brought to England prior to 1895 by Sir William Henry Wilkinson (1858-1930), a British Sinologist who served as British consul in China and Korea and who wrote many articles and books on Chinese games such as A Manual of Chinese Chess (1893), Chinese Origin Of Playing Cards (1895), The Game of Khanhoo (1895) and Bridge Maxims (1918).&lt;br/&gt;In 1891 Wilkinson induced the card maker Charles Goodall to issue a special pack of cards with accompanying booklet of rules to play Khanhoo. The deck contained two sets each of Ace through Nine of Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds, with two specially-designed Jacks, Queens and Kings standing in for the &amp;quot;extra cards&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This entry is for the game promoted by Wilkinson and should be distinguished from the earlier Kanhu or Kwa Oh played with money-suited playing cards. The game should also be distinguished from allied games like Cuajo, which use Spanish-suited playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
