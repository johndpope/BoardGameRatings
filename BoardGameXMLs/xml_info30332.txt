			<description>From the author: Groups is related to Lines of Action, with the differences being that pieces in Groups move only one space, only orthogonal connections count, there are no captures, and the game begins with a drop phase. The game also bears a resemblance to Teeko, with the movement of pieces to attain a configuration, although in Groups a winning configuration can take any form provided all pieces are orthogonally connected. I had been playing it [the game with no jump rule] and found that it eventually bogged down with defensive play. I wanted to speed it up some, so I added a rule that a piece was allowed to jump over another piece to an empty space. I thought this would open the game up more. What I had found is that the game grew immensely more dynamic, and much more offensive, and finished a lot faster. What would go on from 30 turns for a game usually now finished up in under 10. The play balance seems the same now, but the game is a lot faster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer's Note: For individuals who would prefer a more strategic, and less tactical, game eliminate the jump move in the game (see the entry in the variants section).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Super Duper Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
