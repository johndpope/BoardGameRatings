							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battletech: Historical Turning Points – Galtor</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book: Several years before titanic events erupted into the Fourth Succession War, the last significant battle of the Third Succession War took place in 3025, on the sleepy, border world of Galtor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hanse Davion, Prince of the Federated Suns, attempted to regain control of the stalemate along his border with House Kurita by leaking the existence of a fake hidden Star League cache on Galtor. Once the Dragon took the bait, House Davion forces would spring their trap. Yet when a real Star League cache is found, all bets are off and Davion forces are fighting for their lives, while attempting to secure the ancient ruins that could hold ancient treasures!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historical Turning Points: Galtor extracts the sourcebook details from the classic Galtor Campaign scenario book and represents it in the phenomenally successful Jihad Turning Points PDF exclusive format. Return to an earlier time in BattleTech history, when centuries of Succession Wars have honed an animosity to a razor's edge between the Great Houses of Davion and Kurita! This campaign series uses the Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the option of fighting individual battles, following a campaign arc, inserting it into their own campaigns and even create their own scenarios. This PDF exclusive includes a detailed map of the world of Galtor, a run down of the forces involved in the conflict, and several tracks that players can use to run simple lance-on-lance battles, or stage up to a world-wide invasion. Only the players' imaginations are the limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
