			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monocle is a satirical game of funny accents, conspiracy theories, pretentious language, intrigue, outlandish claims, and having a good time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is set in a land where all the power rests in the hands of a select few, those fortunate enough to have a Monocle. The working class is oppressed and treated poorly by these tyrants, and &amp;ndash;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I say there, good chap, don't you think this account is rather tendentious?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Errr, what's that now?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Really now, this is akin to calumny. Spare us all any tsuris from your recondite agenda and give us a propitious mention now and again, won't you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I really have no idea what you saying at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is sayink that you are supportink Great Revolution!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now wait a minute, who are you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An obstreperous, feckless, scrofulous cad with claims that, if they weren't risible, would be parlous indeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is beink member of tyranny what is makink you such pretentious bastard, or are you beink this way on purpose?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now listen here, uh, gentlemen, I'm trying to give the introduction to this game. I don't have time or space for this, whatever exactly this is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Couscating! I was mentioning to my Amanuensis yesterday, which was rather pluvious you may recall, that these so-called 'Revolutionaries' really seem to find a quotidian casus belli. Wouldn't you agree?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is tellink vicious lies, like always! Revoltink against the oppressors is sacred duty! Proletariats of the world...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...unite?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Da, comrade! Proletariats of the world are unitink even as we speakink!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You know, I don't think he actually knows what that means. His language is really quite guignol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm not convinced you understand any of what you're saying. Do you just sit down and look up big words all day?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why no, I am not so quiescent, though I am insouciant, it's true. Words are my m&amp;eacute;tier. I will grant you eleemosynary and assume that was a failed attempt at jocose palaver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revolution is not beink stopped! Are broadcastink to whole world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actually, this is just the introduction to an RPG I am writing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RP...G? Is conspiracy by out of touch elite to be enslavink the masses, yes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actually it's a game that people like to play, where they take on roles like &amp;ndash;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like Charades? Splendid! Did I ever tell you the time where I had to get my brother-in-law and second cousin to guess the Second battle of Saratoga?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is goink on again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Sigh* Well, I've run out of time, so I guess this will have to serve as my introduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pip, pip! Time for tea and crumpets!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sure, why not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
