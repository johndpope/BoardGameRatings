			<description>12 Men on the Field:Deluxe Edition lets you be the owner of a professional football franchise.  It is based on football as it is played in the United States.  You follow your team through a 14 week season and, with good play calling and some luck, into the playoffs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Zeppelin Edition lets you watch the game like a true fan.  Cheer for the touchdown, complain about the bad penalty calls, berate your coach for going for it on 4th and 25 yards to go...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sideline Edition lets you call the plays.  Will you run on 1st and 10?  Pass?  Mix it up a little to keep your opponent&amp;rsquo;s defense guessing?  That 4th and 25 isn&amp;rsquo;t such a no brainer when you are behind with two minutes left to play.  The Sideline Edition is an add-on to the Zeppelin Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two great ways to play American Football.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
