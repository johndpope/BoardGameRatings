			<description>Lamb saddle? Tuna steak? Or maybe lobster with herb sauce?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TOP Kitchen is a delightful board game about managing the kitchen and menu in a gourmet restaurant for 2 to 4 players. Each player takes the role of a Chef and competes for the greatest prestige. To achieve the goal they prepare gourmet dishes, for which they need to acquire all the necessary ingredients and seasonings in an exciting rivalry for the best prices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With all the groceries and additional helpful appliances ready Chefs must hurry to cope with incoming orders. Cooking is represented by joyful dice rolling to which you can apply certain modifiers. Thanks to the &amp;quot;Action Deck&amp;quot; cards each Chef can use instant bonuses to boost their own or meddle in the opponents dishes with unpleasant incidents. Some of these cards are simple improvements for your own kitchen. However you can also invest these cards for future profit. The chef who gathers the most prestige points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game last 2 to 4 rounds, each divided into three phases. &lt;br/&gt;Phase 1 - Preparation - each player gets 5 randomly selected Action Cards (75 available), some guaranteed income and chooses 3 to 5 menu cards (60 available). Each menu card represents a dish which becomes part of your restaurant menu. &lt;br/&gt;Phase 2 - Groceries/Shopping - the players place their bids and the highest bidder gets to start the shopping. At this stage players acquire ingredients (represented by 90 colored d6 dice) necessary to prepare the dishes and special seasoning (15 cards), which are laid out on the market board. &lt;br/&gt;Phase 3 - the players use a small plastic frying pan as a dice rolling tray and the active player marker. One by one the players roll the dice representing different ingredients and try to achieve success. Incoming orders are being managed in the cooking table placed on the players board. If a player manages to successfully finish the dish he/she is rewarded with some money and most importantly prestige (much higher if one uses the spices).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
