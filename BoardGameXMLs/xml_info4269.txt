			<description>Basically a cross between &amp;quot;Blackjack&amp;quot; and a competitive version of &amp;quot;Bingo.&amp;quot; Lay out the 25 Adventure cards in a 5 x 5 grid, then start dealing out the 52 Number cards to each player one at a time at the players' discretion. If a player is dealt a sequence of Number cards that add up to 8, 9, 10, or 11, they can turn over one or more Adventure cards and place a counter of their color on them, or displace an opponent's counter from an already-revealed Adventure card. If a player busts (is dealt a sequence totaling more than 11), he or she has to remove one of their already-placed counters. The first player to get counters on all five of the Adventure cards in any row or column is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approximate playing time printed on the box is 5 to 15 minutes. The box recommends the game for children Ages 6 - 12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the box says, &amp;quot;Based on the Movie,&amp;quot; the game uses comic-book art rather than art or stills from the film, and in fact doesn't seem to have anything to do with the movie at all. No Richard Pryor, no fractions of cents, nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
