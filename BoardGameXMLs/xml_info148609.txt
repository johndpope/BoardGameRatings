			<description>A team game, where each team tries to determine the mashed up movie title.&lt;br/&gt;Scoring is one point for each title guessed, and a bonus point for both titles. If there are points left over after the 1 minute round, the other team gets a chance to steal the remaining points. Whomever gets the most points gets the card. At the end of the game, you take the cards and try to make combos (most movies starring same actor, most in the same series, most in same genre).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As it's a team game, you will see one person knowing a title, announcing it, then the other team members using that title to guess the rest of the movies. Also, sometimes a player knows the movie but cannot remember its title, so will describe the movie to their teammates. Those are fun moments for me to see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will see an opponent anxiously watching the clock for opportunity to steal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The numbers at the bottom of the card are used to create themed decks.  This lets you use a sub-set of the cards you own to come up with a themed game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
