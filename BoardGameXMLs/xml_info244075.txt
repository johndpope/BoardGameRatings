			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still in active development and available to the public for purchase in it's unfinished state, either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nominated for an Innovation in Game Award at Ludicious, the Hitchhiker First Ride prototype will be published as a Humble Original in the January 2018 Monthly Bundle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re a hitchhiker on a strange journey, unable to remember who you are or where you&amp;rsquo;re headed. Something in your recent past has stolen your memory&amp;mdash; but what? The highway offers clues: a matchbook hidden in your armrest, a photo in the glovebox, billboards and crows along the roadside. Your driver, a farmer, wants to help you, and his personal memories and recollections provide an unexpected window into your own backstory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So far, so good&amp;hellip; until a chance slip-up exposes a pattern of deception, secret correspondences and cruel design. From there, the road is full of surprising turns that will challenge every assumption you&amp;rsquo;ve made along the way. To complete your journey, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to choose your friends wisely&amp;mdash; never knowing if your worst enemy is your own subconscious mind. Hitchhiker is a game about memory, identity and loss, all along a highway where nothing is quite what it seems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hitchhiker prototype introduces the first in a series of rides with different drivers that explore various themes in the subconscious mind. The First Ride prototype will be released as a Humble Original in 2018, with further rides to follow in the near future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The First Ride prototype has been nominated for Innovation in Game at the Ludicious Z&amp;uuml;rich Game Festival, January 18-21, 2018.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
