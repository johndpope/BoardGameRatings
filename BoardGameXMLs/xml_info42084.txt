			<description>Virvar is a children's memory game that is also quite fun for adults. At the start of the game, the twelve symbol chits (numbers, fruits and animals in four colors) are put under the cups and placed on designated places on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the course of the game, players move their pieces and must perform specific actions, like swapping two cups or guessing which symbol is where. A player may also challenge another player. With each mistake, the player loses one life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To even out age differences, players may start with different amount of life cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 game board&lt;br/&gt;12 symbol chits&lt;br/&gt;12 cups&lt;br/&gt;4 playing pieces&lt;br/&gt;28 life cards&lt;br/&gt;1 die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
