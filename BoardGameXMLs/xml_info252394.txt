							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The White Isle</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The White Isle started as an adventure for some friends who had never played dungeons and dragons before. It exists scribbled down between two notebooks. I very much enjoyed running it and the friends had fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I then had the grand idea of attempting to turn it into a module for others to use. I planned out what else I needed to write, commissioned some very talented people to create some art, and bugged some other people for advice on the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The art came back looking fantastic. I felt like I had a solid plan for finishing the project and was very excited to tackle my first serious DIY module. Then, life got very busy all of a sudden and The White Isle got stuck in semi limbo. Then the hard drive in which I had the art stored stopped working, so I lost all the art for the first time. The White Isle was well and truly in limbo at that point. Then, my ISP irreversible wiped all of my emails (including the digital copies of the art). With the art lost twice I more or less gave up on ever finishing The White Isle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Somewhat ironically, considering the dead god of time central conceit of the module, The White Isle was stillborn and rotted away to nothingness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That was about four years ago...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
