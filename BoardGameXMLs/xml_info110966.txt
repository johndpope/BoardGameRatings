							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blast Out in Lebanon</name>
									
			<description>From published material&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YOU are Jason Malone, free-lance agent for the US government. Your latest assignment: infiltrate Beirut, Lebanon, to find David Saxon, kidnapped compatriot, before the information he acquired for peace-keeping reasons is coerced out of him and used to set off the Middle Eastern powder keg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get Saxon out, you must make snap decisions under pressure and use the skills you have acquired in years of undercover work--firing a gun with uncanny accuracy, subduing your enemies in hand-to-hand combat when necessary, throwing a grenade or bomb to precisely the place it needs to go, or sneaking into areas under such tight security that legitimate personnel have a tough time getting in. The challenge is yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional User Information&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blast Out in Lebanon is Sniper! Adventure Gamebook #2. This title is part of a series of solo adventures published to generate interest in TSR's release of Sniper! 2nd edition&amp;quot; after their acquisition of SPI. The player follows a series of paragraphs, each of which end with a series of choices (or die roll checks) that continue the adventure to the next paragraph. The simple combat resolution system requires only the game book, 2 dice, pencil, &amp;amp; paper. The abilities of the player are preprinted in the gamebook and include Stealth, Hand-to-Hand, Firing, &amp;amp; Bomb-Throwing. The player's starting weapons and their strength are also included. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
