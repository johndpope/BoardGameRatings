							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Royal-er Game of Ur</name>
									
			<description>This is an abstract strategy game played with dice and a chess board.  You are trying to move your dice across the chess board (in a fixed zig-zag pattern) before your opponent has move their dice across the board in the opposite pattern.  The twist comes that after you have rolled and moved a die (which can be your own OR an opponents), it is placed on the board with the rolled number up, and if you land on a die, you move again based on the number showing, but forwards if it is your opponents die, but backwards if your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has feeling of inspiration from a lot of traditional/classic board/chase games, including (obviously) Ur, but also Backgammon and Parcheesi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
