							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lucky Puppy Math</name>
									
			<description>This game has a two sided board. On one side there is a version of Snakes and Ladders called Blue Ribbon Pooch in which players use dogs as tokens, and use two numerical dice and one operations dice to add or subtract before moving their token. Hence, players must perform the required mathematical operations in order to move their token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the other side of the board is Lucky Puppy, in which all players begin in the dog pound and work their way around the board to find a home. There are four special places on the board, where players may improve or hamper their progress by completing a task. When a player lands on one of these spaces, however, all players get a chance at receiving the bonus or penalty: they complete to answer the math question posed by the roll of the dice. A player must complete all the tasks to get a home. Dice are used in the same way as in Blue Ribbon Pooch. The graphics on the game board depict various situations in which a child might interact with a dog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a children's game designed to develop math skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
