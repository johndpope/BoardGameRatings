			<description>Seventh Sense is a comprehensive game state tracker, with automatic functions built in for combat, random number generation, limiting choices based on equipment/skills/etc. Despite the high level of automation, Seventh Sense retains much of the hands-on feel of reading the paper books. With support for multiple profiles, you can run different campaigns, testing out different combinations of skills or path choices, and you can share the game with family or friends. With many varied options for &amp;quot;house rules&amp;quot;, you can customize the playing experience to suit your favorite style, make the game easier or more difficult, earn various in-game awards, or even gain a place in the Hall of Fame!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
