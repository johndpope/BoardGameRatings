			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In our opinion a successful party game should be three things: hilariously entertaining, easy enough for drunk people to understand and personally revealing. There are loads of dirty party games out there, but not many that also have a &amp;quot;getting to know you&amp;quot; element. And that's where we come in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QWDG is pretty simple. It's a deck of personal questions that range from thought-provoking to ridiculous, awkward to obscene. When a card is drawn, everyone writes their own answer to the question. Then one person tries to correctly identify who wrote each answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To sum up: QWDG is a dirty party game for people who want to show off their disgusting sense of humor and prove how well they know their friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
