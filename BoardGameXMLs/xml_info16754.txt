			<description>From the Rules Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Maple Leaf Forever is an expansion set to Brain Train's War Plan: Crimson. The Maple Leaf Forever tries to integrate the Canadian plans to counter the American invasion of Canada as outlined in Sutherland &amp;quot;Buster&amp;quot; Brown's (I'm not making this up) Defense Scheme No. 1. All the rules of War Plan Crimson are used except where noted below. Gamers will note that The Maple Leaf Forever does not interfere with War Plan Crimson, but rather adds a section to the beginning of the game (usually four or five extra turns) which represents the days before the American invasion. It was this period that &amp;quot;Buster&amp;quot; Brown calculated would be critical, if Canada was to resist an American invasion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    War Plan: Crimson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
