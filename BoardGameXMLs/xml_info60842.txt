			<description>The game board is an island with a volcano crater in the middle. Each player tries to build a temple on his/her side of the island. For that, he/she draws a temple component out of a bag. The components are numbered 0 to 3. The component is set up and the corresponding number of red balls is put into the crater. When the crater is too full, the volcano erupts and the balls pour out, destroying much of the temples. The remains can be used again, while everything that fell down is removed. The first player to complete a temple is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
