							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">It Came From Below</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beneath the city lies a massive underground sewer system. However, the sewers are less a construct of the city&amp;rsquo;s planners and builders, but the repurposing of the remains of a much older city that lies beneath new metropolis. Little is known of the ancient city as the majority of which has never been explored. Almost immediately after it was discovered, it was used as a sewer and dumping ground. The city planners quickly put an end to careless dumping as a rat infestation nearly grew out of control. Access to the ancient city was quickly restricted through blockades and new laws matched with severe penalties. The old city was soon forgotten. But now strange things have emerged from the sewers and rumors are whispered behind closed doors. Something is crawling up from below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
