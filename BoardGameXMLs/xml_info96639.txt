			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the Horrors Have Reason to Fear&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When death can lurk around any dark corner, humanity's defenders must be ever-vigilant. Their story is yours, with GURPS Monster Hunters 1: Champions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by Jason &amp;quot;PK&amp;quot; Levine (author of GURPS Psionic Powers), GURPS Monster Hunters 1: Champions gives mighty modern-day heroes what they need to fight the world's most fearsome preternatural foes. This supplement includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Ten high-powered templates for bringing the battle to the brutes and brains of badness. Make psis, sages, and sleuths in mere minutes &amp;ndash; building a 400-point hero has never been so easy!&lt;br/&gt;     Nine new wildcard skills suitable for any cinematic action game &amp;ndash; and expanded rules that make them more useful than ever! Master your chosen field with Detective!, Medic!, and more.&lt;br/&gt;     A completely new magic system &amp;ndash; Ritual Path magic &amp;ndash; that lets casters try any effect they can imagine . . . with dangerous consequences for those who attempt to do too much.&lt;br/&gt;     Quick and easy powers &amp;ndash; Bioenhancement, Mysticism, and Psionics &amp;ndash; that give some champions the edge they need.&lt;br/&gt;     Six templates for inhumans. Become a &amp;quot;bad guy turned good&amp;quot; as a lycanthrope or outcast angel.&lt;br/&gt;     A selection of gear to arm the monster hunters. You have to buy the bullets before the baddies can buy the farm!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coupled with the GURPS Basic Set, this pick-up-and-go supplement is all you need to create heroes for any modern-day cinematic supernatural spectacle. The forces of darkness are about to discover that, sometimes, the prey fights back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
