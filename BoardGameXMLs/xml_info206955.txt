			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edge of Extinction is a fun and educational trading card game about wildlife&amp;hellip; bringing the intensity of gaming into your homes, classrooms, libraries and learning centers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Starter Deck contains 63 unique cards that represent the park, trail or region labeled on the cover of the deck. 2-4 players use their own deck to play against their opponent(s). The goal of the game is to have more points than your opponent at the end of ten rounds. Ideal for ages 10 and up, each game usually take 15-30 minutes to complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key to the game is how the players learn by accident by building ecosystems with the highest points, each player learns how many different species are needed in nature for an endangered species to be introduced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SPECIAL THANKS goes to Anthony Ortega and his game development student at Harrisburg University of Science and Technology for refining the EDGE of EXTINCTION gameplay rules in order to make them easier to understand. We appreciate your assistance with the gameplay rules. TOURNAMENT RULES are also now available thanks to Chad Davis, the first official EDGE of EXTINCTION Tournament Judge. We appreciate the time and dedication Mr. Davis provides to ensure that Tournament Gameplay is structured and fair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
