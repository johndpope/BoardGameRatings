							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality</name>
									
			<description>Rick creates a clone of his grandson Morty in their garage, demanding that he do the laundry. With the chore complete, Rick explains the clone is not of use anymore and shoots him. Clone Morty appears in Purgatory, but is given the choice to return to the garage. The next chore is to obtain a device from outside the garage, but since the clone is not allowed to leave, he summons a being called Mr. Youseeks that imitates his every motion to aid in his task. The device is revealed to be faulty. Rick says to order another, but the computer must be repaired to do so. The new device is delivered, which Clone Morty attaches to a plunger to retrieve a seed stuck in the toilet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty%3A_Virtual_Rick-ality Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
