			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome, brave wizards, to the WIZARD BATTLE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS, where you will take part in deadly combat against your fellow wizards to win it all. But as you reach for the World Cup, maybe some things seem strange to you... Why are you fighting? What are the team managers really doing being the scenes? Why can you die in the game and play again when any wizard worth half their salt knows proper resurrection is impossible? What personal or political tensions might be strained by the games? Why is no one else asking?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
