							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Otosan Uchi</name>
									
			<description>Boxed city setting and campaign supplement for Legend of the Five Rings, second edition. Provides material to play out the events of the Scorpion Clan Coup in game. Also includes material to play out certain battles using the Clan War miniatures supplement. As with a number of AEG boxed sets of this period, in some printings the box size does not fit the books within, meaning the books and maps come pre-bent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Book One: The Imperial Capital: A Location Guide (96 pages)&lt;br/&gt;     Book Two: The Forbidden City: A Walking Tour (96 pages)&lt;br/&gt;     Book Three: The Scorpion's Sting: A game Master's Guide to the Scorpion Clan Coup (80 pages)&lt;br/&gt;     Two folded maps, one with numbered locations for every building in the city&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Beneath the gaze of a watchful Emperor, Otosan Uchi is a vision of all that is wondrous about the Empire. But if the Emperor is old, or neglects his duty, her golden veneer begins to peel and crumble, and a much darker face laughs from beneath painted masks...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;-Seppun Dairoi, Daimyo of the Seppun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the center of the Emerald Empire, there is a city as old as the kami themselves, filled with the culture of the Celestial Heavens. It is a city of wonder, of beauty and of bright gold and glittering jewels, where the webs of deception and intrigue span a thousand years. Otosan Uchi is the home of the Hantei line, the mighty Emperors of the Emerald Empire, shining and touched by the blessings of the Sun Mother, Ameratsu, herself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But within its brightly lit gates and shining lanterns, a dark heart beats beneath the bustling roads of the Emperor's city. The Seven Clans fight for control of powerful districts, poisoned knives strike from shadowed doorways, and four enchanted walls rise above a labyrinth of hidden corridors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Otosan Uchi has stood, impenetrable, for a thousand years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is about to change forever...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Geography of the City: Complete with two huge maps, the city of Otosan Uchi is intricately detailed, building by building, in the most comprehensive city book ever released.&lt;br/&gt;     The Scorpion's Sting: Learn the future of this great city, and of the most powerful forces which war to control the Emerald Throne, in the most anticipated supplement ever. Welcome to the Scorpion Clan Coup.&lt;br/&gt;     Epic Adventure: Whether a campaign in itself, or as a supplement to a larger campaign, the city of Otosan Uchi is filled with adventure ideas, NPCs, and hundreds of detailed locations and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;     History of the City: Suitable to place the city within any timeline. Or to help you choose the epic events which affect the glorious city of Otosan Uchi in your personal campaign. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
