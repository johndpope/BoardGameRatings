							<name  sortindex="1">Return to Mysterious Island 2</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Return to Mysterious Island 2: Mina&#039;s Fate</name>
									
			<description>Sequel to the 2004 video game Return to Mysterious Island, and is again based upon the work of Jules Verne, The Mysterious Island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The character of Mina is back, but now her monkey, Jep, becomes the second playable character; the player will switch back and forth between the two. Each character has their own abilities Jep, for example, can go to inaccessible places and communicate with other monkeys, whereas Mina can read documents and use complex tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can also be synchronised with the player's iPhone, allowing parts of the game, like puzzles, to be completed away from the PC, and then reintegrated again. Players will also be able to communicate with other players online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game the player will fight for their survival on the island, and they must also save the island from an environmental disaster. Return to Mysterious Island II starts with the crash of the helicopter that attempted the rescue of Mina. She survives the crash, but is still on the island. An unknown disease suddenly begins to attack plants, then animals. Mina searches the island, and discovers an external source of pollution. It appears that the only way to save the island is to turn the shield back on, which would prevent her from returning to civilization, like Captain Nemo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Return to Mysterious Island II&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
