							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tranzyt</name>
									
			<description>Game published in Poland in early '80ties by Wydawnictwa &amp;quot;ALFA&amp;quot;, similar to Monopoly (it was even listed as Monopoly alternative name for a while).&lt;br/&gt;Game didn't have a box. It was sold with all components packed in plastic zip-bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The point of the game is to collect as much money (in-game currency called Talars) as possible and cause other players' bankruptcy. Each player represents one shipping and delivery company, and pawn is considered as a truck (TIR). After finishing a lap, player gets money for transported goods. When starting a new lap player may declare &amp;quot;taking special cargo&amp;quot; - which gives bonus money after full lap, but can be easly lost, when doubles are rolled. During the game player may buy the roads he/she passes. When the route is complete (player bought all roads of the one color - for example: H1, H2 and H3) each road separately may be upgraded (3rd class road, 2nd class road, 1st class road superclasshighway). Player collects money fees for passing his/hers roads from another player. Unlike in Monopoly Tranzyt's board is elliptic. There are also shortcuts, and special areas (AutoService, Bridge, Tunnel, Ferry, Parking, Fuel Station). When moving player throws three dice (two regular, and one special with only one dot) - when dot is rolled, some random events happen. Evens are listed in the center of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
