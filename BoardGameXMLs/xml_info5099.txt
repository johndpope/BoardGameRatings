			<description>A distant relative of Clue, where each player tries to deduce the Suspect, Motive, Crime Location and Weapon cards that were put in the Cemetary at the game's outset.  Suspicion cards change hands, some are revealed to all, and so on.  You win by correctly deducing the four hidden cards.  Deduce incorrectly and you've lost, however.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
