							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Experimental Technical Readout: Davion</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jihad has not been kind to the Federated Suns. The vaunted NAIS has been destroyed, and factories across the realm lie in ruins. But even without their bastion of high tech research, the research and development teams of House Davion have labored to push the envelope for military engineering. Drawing on the resources of the Federated Suns, they have devised powerful new secret weapons in the war against the Word of Blake&amp;mdash;but is it too late to make a difference?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental Tech Readout: Davion samples the custom and prototype designs that have begun to turn up in testing labs and top-secret proving grounds of the Federated Suns. Each design featured in this book incorporates some of the latest technologies developed by the realms of the Inner Sphere as the war against the Word of Blake continues. These technologies&amp;mdash;first described in Tactical Operations&amp;mdash;have yet to achieve widespread production, but each has been prototyped and rushed to the field for their desperate consumers. Statistics and Record Sheets are included for 13 new experimental BattleMechs, vehicles, aerospace units, and battle armor designs presented in this book, ready for play in advanced BattleTech games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
