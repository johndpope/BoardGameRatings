			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;ペリーは来ないで (Perry Konai de) is a card game by the doujin circle 哀愁旅館きたぐに (Aisyu Ryokan Kitaguni) released for the Game Market Tokyo 2017 Spring board game convention in Japan, Tokyo, Odaiba in May 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's name translate roughly as 'Don't come Perry'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The character of Perry refers to Matthew C. Perry, the Commodore of the United States Navy who played a Major role in opening to Japan in 19th century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game each player is trying to collect poos to prevent Perry, attracted by their gold, from coming to their port.&lt;br/&gt;The players take turns in drawing cards and playing them any face they want up in from of themselves or any other player.&lt;br/&gt;If a card is played in a manner that it pincers other cards, a la Othello, the cards in between get flipped: a Poo card become a Gold card, and a Gold card become a Poo card.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of a round, the player with the most Gold cards must draw a Point card. When a player exceeds the maximum number of points, the game stops and the player with the less points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The manual is in Japanese but you don't really need Japanese to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;ペリーの熱い視線がいまジパングに注がれている。&lt;br/&gt;「ペリー来ないで」はオセロのギミックを取り入れた競争型カードゲームです。&lt;br/&gt;プレイヤーは自分の港に黄金を貯めつつペリーがこちらに来ないようウ〇コも溜めましょう。&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
