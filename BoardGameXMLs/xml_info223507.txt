			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get ready for one of the most brutal war games, as you take the role of a lord, and fight your way through the Scorched Kingdoms. Choose your clan, build the perfect deck, and create a seamless strategy for the ultimate 1-vs-1 battle to rule the nations of Ethalios. Dominate kingdoms, obliterate armies, and claim the throne as all others bow before you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will have to learn countless strategies for every situation, and always stay ahead of your opponent. One wrong move can end entire wars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the 11 Nations are broken up into multiple kingdoms and clans. They will have entirely different armies and strategies for battle, ensuring that two battles are never the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scorched Kingdoms is a standalone, tabletop card game for 2 players to battle head to head. It takes advantage of many deck building elements, where you create your clan with different characters, equipment, and environment cards, to strategically defeat the opponent&amp;rsquo;s clan, and capture their throne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It also has a resource management system, used to collect the essence of the nation, which creates legendary tiered cards. These can include giant mechanized titans, terrifying abominations, or rulers from other realms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
