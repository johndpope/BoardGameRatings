							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Artifact (Project)</name>
									
			<description>The Artifact is a game for 2-5 players where betraying your friends and stealing from them is as important as discovering resources and exploring the cosmos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Artifact uses an innovative map dynamic which means every game is unique and different.&lt;br/&gt;Set in the far-future and featuring startling artwork, over 100 cards, exotic locations and constantly evolving play, The Artifact is a game like no other.&lt;br/&gt;Win by strategy, tactics or blind luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can choose from 8 different factions, each with their own ideology, abilities and agenda.  &lt;br/&gt;Everyone starts from Earth and plays location cards to build the game board and open exploration.  This gets larger and more expansive every turn!  &lt;br/&gt;Moving around the universe, players attempt to capture Artifact Markers from different locations such as planets, derelict ships, spaceports, even Alien colonies!  All the while hamstringing other players! &lt;br/&gt;Using events, items, special abilities and fuel, players can fight, steal, strand or even send players in the wrong direction, all to achieve the ultimate goal; gain 4 Artifact Markers and begin the Race for the Artifact!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
