			<description>Our Orc heroes are real adventurers. Wherever they can spread chaos and be glorious, they come bursting furiously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They heard of the Age of Towers Kickstarter Campaign, from our Devil Pigs friends, and decided to go have a look! The perfect excuse for some kharnage! To avenge themselves, the Devil Pigs have left in our universe the Porks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those of you who thought that Orcs where the most deceitful and vile creatures, don&amp;acute;t fool yourselves!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion will introduce the teamplayer mode : you can play Orcs vs Porks, where the mutual aid will be encouraged on each side. In order to protect yourselves from the Cheap Shots of the opponents, you can protect yourselves with body guards, ready to take the blows on your behalf. At the end of the game, the team with most Gains will win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solidary Orcs, it&amp;acute;s beautiful!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will have as well the possibility of playing a game with only the Porks. The Brawl Cards with the Orc heroes from the base game can be put on the central pile to make for epic, violent fights. The Pork Brawl Cards will allow as well the Orcs to avenge themselves and to unwind the Porks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion offers you so many possibilities to go postal!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the Pork heroes, we welcome Lord Bacon! A general, coming directly from the dementious Universe of Kharnage and Age of Towers, by Devil Pigs. He will lead an insane crusade against the Orcs to demonstrate who is the biggest deceiver!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
