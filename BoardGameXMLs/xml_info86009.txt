							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Silvervine Games Core Rulebook and Cyrus Worldbook</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;from the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who Do You Want To Play Today? &lt;br/&gt;In a lot of gaming systems that question gets answered for you, but not here. Silvervine is all about you and the character you want to play. Designed to let you build your character and define the way EVERYTHING about them works, the system encourages collaborative play and supports the Game Master and players with a simple to run, easy to improvise, and fun system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character Creation&lt;br/&gt;Character creation in Silvervine works on a point buy system. Buy skills, powers, raise your character&amp;rsquo;s attributes, and get just the right mix for your character concept.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thematics&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve got total control of how and why your character&amp;rsquo;s stuff works. When you activate your flight power do Dragon Wings grow from your back, erupting in mystic flame? Do you rev up your steampowered jetpack and erupt into the sky? It&amp;rsquo;s all in your hands! Is your sword forged from a single dragonscale, is your mace a giant wrench, is your handgun embedded in your metallic arm? That&amp;rsquo;s up to you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cinematics&lt;br/&gt;Just like you have control over the thematics of your powers and equipment, you have cinematic control of your actions. You get to say what happens and how. Your actions are in your descriptions and are as incredible as you want them to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Narrative&lt;br/&gt;Silvervine is about stories - the story of the characters, the story the Game Master is crafting, and the collaborative space they come together in. Shared narrative ties it all together and makes the fun. The game system keeps it balanced and fun but the story makes it yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
