							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gem Quest</name>
									
			<description>Gem Quest is the fun and simple card game in which you try to be the first to buy and collect sets of matching jewels, while attempting to stop your opponents from doing the same!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How To Play&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the deck and deal all players 5 cards. If a player gets an &amp;quot;Action&amp;quot; card, it must be traded in for a replacement. Blindly insert said action card back into the deck. Set the deck face down between all players, which shall have a discard pile beside it.&lt;br/&gt;The player left of the dealer takes the first turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each turn, the player flips the deck's top card onto the discard pile. If it's an Action card, take the action (if possible). If it's a coin, the player takes it in to hand. If it's a gem, the player may put coins equal (or greater) to its value on the discard pile to buy it into hand. If the player cannot afford (or doesn't want) the gem, remove it to a field of cards on the playing surface (the Gem Store), from which gems may be bought during one's turn by paying coins to the discard pile. Change is not given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a pair of the same gem is collected, it must be set down for all to see. A third of that gem may be added to make a trio. The diamond counts as a pair or trio by itself. Play moves clockwise. If the deck exhausts, reuse the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first to get 3 pairs, or 2 trios, of gems, wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
