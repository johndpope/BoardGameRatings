							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Emperor&#039;s Fleet: Command at Sea Volume  IX</name>
									
			<description>(from the back of the book:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emperor's Fleet provides statistics for the Japanese ships and aircraft, and all their weapons and sensors extant in the Second World War.  Over 200 ship-classes and over 130 aircraft are included, many of which have not appeared in print before. All earlier listings for these ships and aircraft have been updated to include information from newly available references, and great strides have ben made in reconciling conflicting or incorrect sources.  Damage data and other game-related information has also been updated to Command At Sea 4th Edition standard. More than making the information compatible with Command At Sea, the data is now in the same format and uses the same standards as &amp;quot;Harpoon&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Fear God and Dreadnought&amp;quot;, the other core games in the Admiralty Trilogy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All ships and aircraft extant from 1939 to late 1945, including several projected and/or hypothetical platforms are also here, such as the Tosa class battleship, cancelled after the Washington Treaty. A detailed listing of Japanese merchant ships is included. Late or post-war platforms include the Ibuki and B64 and B65 classes, as well as the A7M1 Reppu and the Ki-94 interceptor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
