							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Doraemon</name>
									
			<description>In this game, Doraemon must travel through three different chapters in order to save his five human friends who have been kidnapped. Each world is actually a different game with its own style of genre and game play system, and was designed by a different lead designer. The first chapter is an action game that takes place in a pioneer that scrolls continuously in four directions. The second chapter is a shooter game that scrolls through the evil den automatically in both horizontal and vertical directions. The third chapter is an aquatic adventure game where each screen scrolls over to the next. Each world must be completed by defeating a boss at the end. Then the player will advance to the next chapter, until all three bosses have been vanquished. Power-ups can be obtained in each chapter to increase Doraemon's strength and health meter. One power-up from the next chapter can be found in the first two chapters to give you an advantage when you finally arrive there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Doraemon (Famicom)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
