							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Codex: Story Gaming for Creative People</name>
									
			<description>From the RPG Description here on RPGGeek:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Codex is an RPG for writers and other creators who want to use games as a medium to create a world and share stories within it. In Codex, a picture, short story or poem can simultaneously describe a part of the world and a character attribute. Blue, Green and Red books let players develop a cohesive setting for themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple yet broad system determines the fates of individuals, groups and even entire nations. The conflict systems cover duels of wit, furious sword fights and massive propaganda campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although Codex is designed for your own characters and world, the game includes the city of Eight Gates as an example setting. Use it -- or add it to your own world. You can use Codex as a complete RPG or you can use it to manage the fictional content of other games. It's especially suited to text-based games, including those played by forum or weblog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
