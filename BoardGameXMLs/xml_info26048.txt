			<description>This game is a race to the finish.  Several pitfalls and twists and turns await your journey home.  This game is similar to an advanced chutes and ladders as some paths let you skip past sections and others send you back. Action cards also affect your play along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board itself is a giant puzzle and comes in 6 large pieces that fit together to form the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
