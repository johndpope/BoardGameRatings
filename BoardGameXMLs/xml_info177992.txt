Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B.C. was cancelled in 2004 for unknown reasons. B.C. was going to take place during a prehistoric time period on a single continent which contained five levels. The player controls a tribe who has to evolve and migrate to become the best species in the game. Tribe members can be of different classes and each can level up different ways to evolve. The main enemies in the game are an ape-like creature called the &amp;quot;simians&amp;quot;; however, the world is also inhabited with many types of dinosaurs as well as other creatures, including the dodo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even while the game was still in production, Molyneux said that he was unsure when he could release it due to &amp;quot;the ambitious nature of the gameplay and the high standards the people developing it are pushing for.&amp;quot; According to one article, as of May, 2002, &amp;quot;[the demo build] was roughly 50 percent complete&amp;quot;. Its cancellation was announced in late 2004 with Molyneux saying, &amp;quot;The decision to suspend work on any games project is always a very difficult one, particularly when it is a title with the potential of BC.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;BC (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
