			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Riding Spirits you'll hit the streets on the fastest two-wheeled machines on the planet, from companies like Kawasaki, Honda, Yamaha and Suzuki. Start your career and earn points for winning races as you take on world-class tracks in Europe, America and Japan. Spend serious cash in the shop, adding better wheels, tighter suspension and bigger engines, taking your bike from stock-ride to tricked-out racing machine. Anyone can wheel a bike out of a dealership--can you build yours into a winner?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Test the limits of your abilities on courses where a split-second decision means the difference between victory and defeat. Start your career and earn cash for winning races as you crank open the throttle across 14 different tracks in America, Japan and Europe. Second place is for suckers. Winning is everything. Are you good enough to take the chequered flag?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
