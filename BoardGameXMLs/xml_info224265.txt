							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Slump Factor</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Labyrinth Lord/Mutant Future AD&amp;amp;D free retro-clone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE PRESIDENT IS COO-COO FOR COCOA PUFFS. IS THERE NO ONE THAT CAN STOP HIM?!? An adventure for five 6th level mutants from the future with equipment (provided) to stop the President of the USA and his rampage. Slump's Uncle John was a great MIT scientist in his own right who helped innumerable cancer patients with his experiments with x-ray equipment. He was also quite a corrupt man and when the FBI called him in to overlook Nikolai Tesla's paper's when the scientific genius died in his Manhattan Hotel rooms in 1943, Uncle John G. Slump immediately stole several of Tesla's designs. This included Tesla's famed 'death ray' and the drawings for a proto-time machine. It also included an electric car of unlimited endurance which Uncle John immediately took patents out on and shelved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slump has his Uncle John's Tesla Time Machine in Slump Towers along with his death ray and several other inventive devices from the plans of Nikolai Tesla stolen by his Uncle John.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slump's time experiments have caused a vortex where time immigrants are coming back from the future due to his present policies causing massive unemployment in the future USA. This has caused several social groups to spring up in the present time of 2017 to repel the time immigrants such as The Man Whores Against The Future (TMWATF). Also, time assassins are coming back and being committed to mental asylums trying to assassinate Slump due to the god-awful nature of the Future under Slump &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meloney Slump is causing problems with certain Continental photographic shoots she did in her near-past that is causing massive reproduction in the present time leading to more time immigrants and more unemployment in an endless cycle. Can the characters intervene and save the Past from the Future???&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
