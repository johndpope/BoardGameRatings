			<description>CONTENTS&lt;br/&gt;2x big lily leaves (homes)&lt;br/&gt;6x small lily leaves&lt;br/&gt;2x 4 frogs numbered 1-2-3-4&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECT &lt;br/&gt;To race the 4 frogs from one home to the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAY&lt;br/&gt;The starting leaf of player A is the finishing leave of B and vice versa. While all the small leaves lay in between as a path... quite pretty effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The movement is indicated by the number on each frog. Therefore the frog of value 1 will move or jump 1, the frog with a 4 will move or jump 4 leaves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is not luck involved, all the moves take place on that way. A frog is allowed to leap over other frogs and only unoccupied leaves will count as a move. Frogs can also knock off opponent's frogs when jumping over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
