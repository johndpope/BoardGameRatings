			<description>&amp;quot;Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to seek out your opponents and devastate them financially. You will assume the disguise of an attorney and the alias of your choice (Scooter Cohooter, Kid Fleece, L. Gotcha, or Sam Boozlebam). The rules and suggestions are only guidelines; you may operate on the principle that anything you can get away with is legal. In order to preserve the spirit of Hornswoggle, I recommend no mercy be extended to those players in dire financial straits.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hornswoggle was designed to capture the essence and true spirit of the legal system. Certain modifications were necessary to make the game function logically (unlike the real thing).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Objective: To have the most money on deposit in the Swiss Bank after the game ends. You will accomplish this by suing your opponents. One third of your profits will be deposited in your Swiss Bank account.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
