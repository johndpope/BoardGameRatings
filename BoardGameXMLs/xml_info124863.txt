			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement began as a debate. It was not the sort of debate with rules of order and thirty second rebuttals. It was instead the kind that culminates in such phrases as oh yeah and fisticuffs. The central point of these early exchanges was what is the alignment of a death god.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To add fuel to the fire we asked everyone we knew what they thought the alignment should be and we got answers that covered the gamut from neutral to lawful evil to chaotic good. Each suggestion came equipped with compelling arguments. It was amazing to us was how strongly people felt about an issue of such limited importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So in the spirit of lively exchange, Cognizant Chance is proud to present At Death&amp;rsquo;s Door. This is a collection of death related deities each from a different perspective and for various races. We sincerely hope that they will prove useful to game masters in their campaigns but also cast a little philosophy into the role-playing mix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
