			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's harvest time, and all the farmers, young and old, are on their feet and in high spirits, ready to celebrate a good harvest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players in Funny Farmer want to help bring in the harvest, and Johnny Tractor is ready to go out into the field. But how successful you are with the harvest and how many vegetables you bring back depends on how well you control Johnny. You can't take too long, though, as a thunderstorm is coming, and those torrential rains will end the harvest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
