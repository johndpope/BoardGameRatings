			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tasmanian Devil has busted out of the Acme Zoo on an island-hopping mission to find a safe place to live. Big game hunters want to grab the spinning devil and put him behind bars. It's up to you to keep Taz from becoming a permanent display!&lt;br/&gt;Leap, bounce and spin through five gigantic islands-each with devilish traps and hidden dangers for Taz to survive. Guide him through monster-infested swamps and sticky pools of quicksand on islands scattered across the South Pacific. Taz-Mania'll keep you spinning!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Blast through the tropics with the tornado spin and knock off enemies right off the screen!&lt;br/&gt;     Squash enemies with a &amp;quot;Taz Stomp&amp;quot; to temporarily stun them!&lt;br/&gt;     Ride on a wild rollercoaster and a haunted mine car!&lt;br/&gt;     Make it to Dodo Island to face off against diabolical dinosaurs!&lt;br/&gt;     Big Hat Hunter wants the ultimate prize-Taz in his collection!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
