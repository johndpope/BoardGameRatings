			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the fall of 1944 and the Allied Forces are making strides in the liberation of Europe. The Nazis are desperate to find anything that they can use to slow the advance of the Allies as they march across France.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OSS has received troubling reports from Basque fighters as well as French Resistance members in Southern France. North of the small town of Albi, a contingent of German soldiers and scientists have taken up residence in an abandoned home on one of the region's many hilltops. It has been reported that Werner Heisenberg himself has visited the site and oversaw the creation of a small laboratory. However, more troubling than that is the strange report of balls of light coming from the grounds of the compound. Allied Intelligence fears that the Germans are working on a super weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your group is tasked with infiltrating the compound, stealing the technology if possible or destroying it if not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Operation Lightning&amp;rdquo; is an adventure with supernatural elements for 4&amp;ndash;6 players using Fabled Environments&amp;rsquo; “Victorian Style Mansion” and “Craftsman Style Bungalow” maps and the Savage Worlds core rules, suitable for an evening&amp;rsquo;s play. The premise of this adventure requires characters that possess military skills, but not necessarily members of the military. Seven pre-generated characters are provided at the end of the module for your convenience as well as small copies of the Victorian Style Mansion and Craftsman Style Bungalow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
