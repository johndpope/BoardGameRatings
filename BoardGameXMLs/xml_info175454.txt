							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Benedict Arnold and the Northern Theater</name>
									
			<description>An insightful strategist and leader of men, Benedict Arnold was the true hero of the Battles of Saratoga in 1777, which resulted in a formal alliance with France and the turning point of the American Revolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operating in the Northern Department (the northern theater of the war), Arnold worked tirelessly in the cause of liberty for years. If he had died at Saratoga instead of being seriously wounded, his legacy would have been nothing short of legendary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Benedict Arnold and the Northern Theater is designed to provide players with a neglected yet important slice of history -- and, using the Do or Die Roll(TM) game system -- an easy-playing, exciting gaming experience for both experienced wargamers and newbies alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now in development with a well-known, respected publisher!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Update 1/9/18: unfortunately, for various reasons the production of this game has been canceled. There may be some interest from another publisher, so cross your fingers. Meanwhile, I've uploaded all the files to the game as print-and-play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
