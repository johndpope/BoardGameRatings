							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Demolition Racer: No Exit</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technically a sequel to a little known PlayStation game, &amp;quot;Demolition Racer: No Exit&amp;quot; is a well thought out racing game where coming first isn't necessarily the best move to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mixing the ideas of a demolition derby with a regular racing game, players have to knock out competing racers &amp;amp; earn style points in how they do so, as well as the traditional racing aim of getting to the finishing line first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The single player gameplay consists of a career mode principally focused on the races described above. Incidental competitions include more traditional destruction derby events, &amp;quot;Chicken Runs&amp;quot; &amp;amp; &amp;quot;Suicide&amp;quot; modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a number of unlocks available in the game's career mode, including a tennis minigame &amp;amp; a &amp;quot;Light gun&amp;quot; style shooting minigame, both involving cars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
