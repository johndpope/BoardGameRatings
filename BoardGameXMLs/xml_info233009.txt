							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quirky</name>
									
			<description>Quirky is a fast-moving, quick-thinking, fun, question and answer, bluff and banter game for family and friends. It is not like a conventional fact-based quiz - in this game you decide the answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you answer against a 40-second sand timer and, if you don't know, try to convince others that you do. Younger players compete on equal terms as quick wit and cheeky confidence are more important in the game than knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You win the cards you answer, unless your answer is challenged, then the winner of the challenge keeps that card and steals another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you can't answer you don't pass - you roll the QUIRKY die for a chance to win the card anyway, and if you lose you can choose who it goes to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A distinctive feature of the game is that many of the answers will vary according to who is playing, when and where.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    For family and friends aged 10 years to adult&lt;br/&gt;    1152 questions&lt;br/&gt;    Game time recommendation 30 minutes, but you can decide that too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
