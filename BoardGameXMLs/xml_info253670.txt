			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NightLife is an adventure/horror game set in late-1990s New York City. Players take the part of various races of monsters, including Vampyres, Werewolves, and Shades, in addition to several other types of monsters. These races, who collectively refer to themselves as the &amp;quot;Kin,&amp;quot; divided themselves along political lines they refer to as &amp;quot;factions.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of these factions are pro-human, like the Commune, while others, like Red Moonrise, hate Humanity. For the purpose of this adventure, all the PC&amp;rsquo;s are assumed to be part of a single &amp;quot;cell&amp;quot; of the Commune. A cell operates independently, and has little formal contact with other cells, much like the French Resistance during WWII.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
