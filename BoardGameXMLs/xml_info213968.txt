							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cavaliers Unhinged - Taking Chivalry in a New Direction</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The concept of the unmounted cavalier is not a new one, but we are offering two new archetypes that take that idea into a whole new direction as well as a darker, more Lovecraftian themed order for those that wish to take their cavaliers into the realm of horror. Rodney Sloan has contributed two pieces to this issue including the Revolutionary archetype (think Les Miserables) as well as the Order of Ancient Horror to scare the pants off those that would dare question your cavalier's demands. And the Duel Master is included, offering a more versatile and quick thinking cavalier when taking on others in single combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
