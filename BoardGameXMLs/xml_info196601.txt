			<description>Escape the Sanitarium is a worker placement co-op in which the players try to escape from the Mistview Sanitarium with the most victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See who can escape with their sanity intact, all the while trying to uncover the secrets at Mistview. Each turn players choose the role of the players to their right or left depending on each player's current disorders and levels of sanity.  Gather resources such as medicine, courage, sanity, insanity, and contraband to gain influence with staff, uncover dark secrets, and ultimately escape the Sanitarium!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
