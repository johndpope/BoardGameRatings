							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paladin of Ethdale</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The people of Ethdale are ardent followers of Tyr. For over a thousand years, a Paladin of Tyr has been sitting on the throne. The temple of Tyr has a major presence in the city and plays a heavy role in administrating the affairs of Ethdale. The city has been peaceful for many years and the people in the city have become complacent in the service to Tyr. They believed that they were blessed and this blessing would never be taken away. As such, they slowly became more debaucherous and unjust, believing that they could do nothing wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 2nd - 4th level characters.  Typically distributed as a ZIP archive including the RTF scenario and two BMP files (maps).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
