			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sword Coast is the home of Waterdeep, the most influential and prominent city of the North of Faerun. Our adventurers are unaware of a plot to overthrow the government and spread chaos throughout all of Faerun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We pick up as our adventurers just saved the girl, got the loot, but then discovered the city of Nesm&amp;eacute; was overtaken by the Stone Giants. In their escape they encounter danger before finding the town of Mornbryn's Shield. This is where the players learn of a mysterious caravan traveling through the Evermoors towards Nesm&amp;eacute;. Who are they and what do they want with Nesm&amp;eacute;? The players meet Oboth Thornsteel, the captain of the Zhentarim Mercenaries and he sends them to intercept the caravan. The information they learn is the start of a very sinister plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
