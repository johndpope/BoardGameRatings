			<description>This Milton Bradley Game comes with 1 wooden disc and two wire hockey &amp;quot;crooks&amp;quot;. You play the game by first placing the disc on the center spot on the boards and then each player takes a wire crook and then trying to draw or knock the wooden disc (puck) through the goal to the players right. The opponent plays at the same time, each player trying to get the puck into their goal. The game is started by one player tapping 3 times and then calling 'GO!&amp;quot; The game is played to a predetermined number of gaols. The player reaching that pre-determined number wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
