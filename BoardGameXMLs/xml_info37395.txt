			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Get ready to travel across Antarctica with Riley and his family as you race to rescue five penguins in danger and return them home safely! Packed with informative facts, twists and turns, Penguin Rescue is based on the award-winning book Adventures of Riley: South Pole Penguins.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, two dice with colored faces are thrown.  The player may elect to resolve the dice in either order, which offers one of the minor strategy points in the game.  One side of the die says WILD which allows a card to be drawn which immediately has an effect on the player (move back, move ahead etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the first to collect a full set of the five colored penguins and return to home to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
