							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wizard&#039;s Academy</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: This volume includes FANTASTICAL CREATURES AND HOW TO SURVIVE THEM, which is necessary for running this adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Windfell Academy is an enigmatic place. Alongside their traditional studies, students can gain personalized summoning advice from a reformed succubus, delve the library&amp;rsquo;s many tomes with the aid of the library troll, or simply pass the time visiting with the school&amp;rsquo;s goblin groundskeeper as he explains the finer points of goblin holidays. But the school is also in jeopardy; the headmaster is missing, students are disappearing, and if the PCs can&amp;rsquo;t uncover the culprit in time, no one will survive until graduation!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Wizard&amp;rsquo;s Academy, the PCs are tasked to join and explore an enigmatic academy of magic, delving the secret dungeons underneath the school while retaining their cover as innocent students. Alongside classic dungeon-crawling adventures, the PCs will also have the chance to attend classes, encounter school-related events such as a divination contest and a dueling club, all while searching for clues related to the missing headmaster and students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 8 possible villains and an adaptable encounter system, Wizard&amp;rsquo;s Academy is an adventure module that can easily be adapted for any party of PCs be they level 1 or 20, and can also be adapted in length, taking either a few gaming sessions to complete or becoming a small campaign unto itself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delve the school&amp;rsquo;s secrets and protect its students, but beware: Windfell Academy is a dangerous place, and death is not considered an acceptible excuse for missing detention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wizard&amp;rsquo;s Academy is an adventure module designed for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and the Sphere of Power magic system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volume also comes complete with Fantastical Creatures and How to Survive Them, a Spheres of Power bestiary with over 100 monsters, including both original creatures and classic fantasy monsters adapted to the Spheres of Power magic system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
