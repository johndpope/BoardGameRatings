							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">RoboSockets</name>
									
			<description>RoboSockets is a fascinating arcade-puzzle with a unique combination of tetris, pipes and match 3 mechanics. Thought-out world of lively characters with their history, legends and heroes makes it addictive and engaging as no other casual game on the platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RoboPlanet lies in ruins left without electricity by a short circuit and desperately needs a tiny human intervention to plug in sockets of helpless robots. Direct robots to connect to each other with their hands/sockets and create a chain of 5 or more robots. Each chain gives you energy needed to restore the planet&amp;rsquo;s functionality and revive the RoboCivilization. Diversity of robo-characters, smooth learning curve and unique bonus features make RoboSockets a perfect brain trainer. Simple idea, several modes to challenge yourself in, elaborate design, sounds and storyline make it pick-up-and-play and addictive. It&amp;rsquo;s as simple as genius and brings a breath of fresh air to the tried bejeweled-type games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
