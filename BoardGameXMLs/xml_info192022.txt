			<description>Take on the role of 1 of 7 quirky old characters as they battle the Grim Reaper in a race for their soul.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modify your mobility scooter, kit it out with awesome weapons and customised parts to help you stay ahead of the pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take on the Grim Reaper and his army of zombies over 13 races where only the most skilled racer will survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to a suburban retirement village where all is not as it seems&amp;hellip; After settling down to recover from the responsibilities of working life, the residents of Sunny Pines have been idling away the days, life could not be more tranquil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, a creepy new resident, Mr Grim Reaper, looks set to turn retirement on its head&amp;hellip; After years trawling the earth for souls to harvest, Mr Grim Reaper concludes Sunny Pines is where he&amp;rsquo;ll lay his hat; here he can harvest souls from the comfort of his rocking chair. However, seven of the sprightliest OAPs (old age pensioners) have other ideas and set out to prove that life for Grim at Sunny Pines definitely won&amp;rsquo;t be like shooting fish in a barrel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stately seven decide to strike a deal with the Grim Reaper; a racing championship to the death. If they can prove themselves to be fast and full of life, surviving and ultimately winning the championship, then he will allow them to live. However, too slow and they will be condemned to the retirement village in the sky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What the Reaper doesn&amp;rsquo;t tell the folk of Sunny Pines is that once he takes your soul he can bring you back as one of his army of the living dead; mobility scooter racing zombies that are hell bent on making sure that nobody wins, by any means possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
