							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Eclipse</name>
									
			<description>In this game (subtitled &amp;quot;A Souvenir To Celebrate The Eclipse, Cornwall 1999&amp;quot;) the players take the role of hitch-hikers making their way into Cornwall to view the 1999 full solar eclipse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game mechanics are basic; roll-and-move along a variety of routes (accurately based on the major roads in Cornwall), racing against time.  Each move is a random length and takes a random time (rolled on two separate dice); the game starts with 72 hours before the eclipse - the duration of each move is deducted from each player's personal 'clock'.  In the process the players also have to earn money by doing bits of casual work here and there in order to have the &amp;pound;50 entrance fee that admittance to the &amp;quot;optimum viewing site&amp;quot; requires for admittance.  If time gets tight the players even have the opportunity to visit Merlin's Cave at Tintagel to be sent back in time after completing a task for him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a strange game, probably more interesting as a curiosity/souvenir than for gameplay.  The quality of components and printing is very good, although most of the graphics used in the game appear to be royalty-free clip art, along with a rather varied selection of fonts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
