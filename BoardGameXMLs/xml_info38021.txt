			<description>A card game played with a custom deck of 52 cards divided into thirteen suits of four cards. The object of the game is to play the most different combos over the course of seven five card hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the combos consist of two pairs (which includes four of a kind, two pairs from the same suit.) Thirty-one types of combos are given names corresponding to the suits involved. For example, a pair from the Princess suit together with a pair from the Sword suit is known as a Warrior Princess combo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
