			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last Rites of the Black Guard is a modern-day ghost-hunting adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nazis left their cruel mark on the world more than 50 years ago, and some of those wounds still bleed. Hitler and other high-ranking Nazis were enamored by the idea of using the Occult in their attempt at world domination. In their quest for power they conducted horrific experiments on the weak, but with the defeat of the Nazis and the freeing of the experiments&amp;rsquo; survivors, humanity thought that their evil would never rise again. They were wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your characters find themselves the only ones willing to help a single mother deal with the terrifying hauntings tormenting her family. But before you can put them to an end, you'll have to investigate their origins by spending an evening in the house yourselves. If you dare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
