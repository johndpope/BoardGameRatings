			<description>My Friends are Weird is a meta party game. When friends come by for a picnic, movie night, party, game night, or just general hanging out, they each pick a card and keep it secret. Each card has an action detailed on it that is out of the ordinary. The players&amp;rsquo; goal is to perform that action without anyone catching on that it is being done for the game. People must notice you are doing the action (unless the card says otherwise). The trick is to try to incorporate it into the context of whatever it is you happen to be doing at the time. If, at the end of the night, you&amp;rsquo;ve pulled it off, you get points based on how tricky the action is to get away with. If you get caught (if someone guesses that you did something weird for the game), you lose any points that you have acquired from that card. You cannot take another card until (1) you are successful with the first one or (2) you get caught doing the first one. If there is debate over whether or not you accomplished something, the group as a whole decides at the end of the night if you pulled it off; partial credit is permitted at the group&amp;rsquo;s discretion. If the action is something that you would do anyways; congratulations, you are a natural at this game and you are weird.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
