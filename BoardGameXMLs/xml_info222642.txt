Few to no details have been released about its gameplay, plot, or release date since its announcement many years ago. It may or may not be in active development, but neither has it been cancelled officially.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is ION?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the creator of DayZ and inspired by the cult-classic Space Station 13; ION is a truly-emergent massively-multiplayer online game in which players will build, live in and inevitably die in player created galactic constructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With fully simulated environments, a massive persistent galaxy and even functioning human organs, the Federation welcomes you to work for your survival on the edge of man-made space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
