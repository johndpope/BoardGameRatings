			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a standard RPGA Network tournament for a team of four to six 3rd-level agents (though the serial&amp;rsquo;s challenges and XP rewards are tiered so that the serial can be played by up to six agents of levels 8, 13, or 18 as well).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This serial focuses on the continuing efforts of the Worldwide Alliance for Regional Domination (W.A.R.D.) to obtain a &amp;lsquo;super-weapon&amp;rsquo;, toward what ultimate aim the Agency has yet to determine. In the previous Living Spycraft serial, SPA2-02: The Beast of Dunvegan, W.A.R.D. tried to steal an experimental resonator weapon from the British Government. After that effort failed, the organization set up a secret laboratory in Malta to produce a retrovirus capable of killing thousands (see SPA3-03: The Maltese Experiment). Fortunately, a defecting W.A.R.D. agent briefed the Agency, allowing one of its agent teams to shut the laboratory down before catastrophe struck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Sir Reginald Smythe, W.A.R.D.&amp;rsquo;s European Control, is growing more and more bold, knowing that his own life is at stake if he fails again. His latest plan &amp;mdash; codenamed FAWKES &amp;mdash; calls for him to use his position as a senior civil servant in the British Ministry of Defence to obtain confidential information about a new prototype submarine &amp;mdash; the Neptune-class Nuclear Attack Submarine. The first of this type &amp;mdash; the HMS Sea Lion &amp;mdash; is scheduled embark upon its maiden voyage shortly, traveling from Faslane Naval Base in Scotland to Gibraltar. The sub carries two multi-warhead missiles, each containing a 50-megaton nuclear device. Both warheads are live.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
