			<description>Welcome to Panzer Orders Western Front, a World War 2 card game. This is a stand alone game for solitaire and two-players and is fully compatible with the other Panzer Orders games and expansions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is quick to setup and play, it takes around 30 minutes to play a game and comes complete with everything you need. Each card has a points value based on the card characteristics and special rules. The players agree a point based battle and then build their decks, spending points on specific cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player must form three columns of any mixture of vehicles, tanks, or infantry and then attack the opponents columns. The first player to defeat all three columns or force the opposing player to draw their last card, wins the game. During the player turn you can choose to dig and defend with your card, moves cards from one column to another or attack with ling range or close combat. Non of these are without their risks and weighing up the risk vs the strategic gain is part of the decision making elements of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is fast, simple but very brutal with all the dice rolls required on the cards - no charts or looking up in the rules. Damaged cards are suppressed first before being removed from the game and can still make a free saving throw on the dice to keep in the fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
