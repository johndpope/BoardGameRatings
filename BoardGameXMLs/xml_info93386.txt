			<description>Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II is an arcade-style Formula One racing video game developed and manufactured by Sega. It is the follow-up to Super Monaco GP, and is sometimes referred to as in its abbreviated form as Super Monaco GP 2, however this is not an official title. The game was released for the Sega Master System, Sega Mega Drive, and the Sega Game Gear, appearing in the United States on 16 July 1992, Japan on 17 July 1992, and sometime later in 1992 in Europe. Along with boasting the most &amp;quot;realistic physics&amp;quot; of any console driving game at the time of release, the game was also endorsed by the then Formula One champion Ayrton Senna. The game's development was also assisted by Senna, who supplies his own advice about the tracks featured in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
