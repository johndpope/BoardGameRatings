							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ghosts of Aniel</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Ghosts of Aniel, a small elven village in the Celadon forest suddenly becomes haunted. Since every resident of the peaceful town has vanished, no one knows if other settlements are in danger. Can the player characters unearth the ghostly truth behind the village's curse?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game designer Steve Kenson brings us the sixth in our series of monthly free adventures. This original Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons scenario is suitable for a party of four 6th-level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Preview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aniel (an-EE-el) is a small elven hamlet in the Celadon Forest. Like most elven communities, it has limited contact with the outside world, but a few weeks ago all contact with Aniel stopped. None of the elves were seen in the communities surrounding the forest, and no one heard anything from them. The group sent to investigate returned with tales of finding Aniel abandoned but also of strange and terrible things happening there; whispering voices, moaning sounds, objects moving of their own accord. It seems clear that Aniel is haunted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the local folk fear to return to the haunted village, there is a feeling that something must be done. If the elven hamlet is haunted, the ghosts there must be laid to rest, and the mystery behind the town's demise must be solved. Whatever fate befell the town might affect other settlements, and a party must be sent to investigate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
