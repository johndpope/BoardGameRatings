							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hi-Low Jambone</name>
									
			<description>This game was created during the playtesting and development Duplicate Heartless.  More information on the development of the games, and the original posting of the rules, can be found in this thread.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in keeping with Duplicate Heartless, players will draft dice from a pool of dice and the play with their dice in the open, making for a game that is combinatorial in nature during play, and also the idea is to have the lowest score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game differs from Duplicate Heartless, however, in several ways:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, game involves using 14 dice of one color and 14 of another color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second, during the game, if the suit die is one color, then the player who played the highest number of the suit die of the pair of dice takes the trick, and if another color is led, then the lowest number die of the suit pair of dice takes the trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jambone is a word connected with a version of Euchre where cards are played face up.  In addition, bones is slang for dice.  Hi and low were chosen as part of the name, because tricks won vary between either high pair of dice, or low pair of dice being the winning pair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
