							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Sights and Sounds to See and Hear after a Battle</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following a battle there will be many different things to see and hear on the battlefield itself. This supplement provides 100 different things for characters to see and hear, some that will occur immediately after the battle itself and some which may take place over the following days or weeks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most are suitable for any pre-gunpowder medieval battlefield but a handful would require the presence of magic to explain. Some might be potentially dangerous for characters. Other descriptions may be too graphic for younger players, as battlefields can be a place of brutality and horror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A small pile of broken wood with a twisted metal rim is only identifiable as having once been a shield by the parts of an emblem that can still be seen on what used to be the front, and its former owner&amp;rsquo;s severed arm to which it is still strapped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the front cover, one the front matter and around one page is blank and the introduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
