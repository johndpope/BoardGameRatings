			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster Keepers is a light-hearted Meta game meant to compliment any role-playing game system. This game encourages both meta-gaming AND micromanagement from the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You should already be proficient with or at least possess a passing familiarity with role-playing games in order to use this product. Therefore you should already know what you need for this game but just to be sure you will need dice, cards, miniatures (or some other way of representing where things are), dungeons, and imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is not a stand-alone product. You will need any of the countless varieties of fantasy role-playing game systems out there. This game does not provide statistics or rules for running the player characters or monsters. This game provides a foundation for running the dungeon and random charts for what happens during the course of managing the dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
