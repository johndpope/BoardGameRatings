			<description>The Meck Wars book is a supplement for Injurius Games. You need Injurius Games to play Meck Wars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 5 years of arena battles, the ratings have gotten flat. The masses are getting restless, and the only thing Emperor Injurius will accept is a massive ratings sweep to bring the people back into the fold. A bright young ad executive at Mars Metals thinks of it first... Why not put Mecks in the Arena?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the Meck War, which ended shortly before the League was formed, humanity swore they would never lose control of their machines again. These arena Mecks would be tightly controlled, highly programmed, and well sponsored by the huge corporations that Emperor Injurius had created to run the League.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After just one match, which put two squads of Mecks against each other, Emperor Injurius knew he had found a winner. The ratings were the highest ever recorded. Humanity had found its newest fad - Meck Wars!&lt;br/&gt;..&lt;br/&gt;.Summary from the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the 22nd Century. After several years of successful gladiatorial games, Emperor Injurius has brought forth a new challenge, in the form of an old enemy, to increase the ratings of the arena battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every gladiator who fights in the arena remembers this enemy. Every gladiator who dies for glory knows that it is a new battle. Every gladiator who hoped never to fight them again must face them one more time...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mecks have returned!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Salvaged from the battlefields of the Solar System, their metal and ceramic bodies re-built, their cold, calculating minds re-programmed, Mecks are the ultimate Corporate product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They don't draw a salary, they take sponsorship without complaint, and they bring in the &amp;quot;underdog&amp;quot; viewer ratings that were sorely missing from recent human matches. The first Meck match was Meck vs Meck, but as their teams of programmers learned to refine their behavior, the Mecks were introduced against humans. Suddenly it was as if the Meck War had never ended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You control a squad of five Mecks: the heavy Jumper leads from the front; a pair of middle-weight Spartans carries the firepower into battle; the light and fast Runners round out the team with speed only a Cheetah Suit's transmission could match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mecks earn Battle Honors the same way humans do, and can also gain software/power upgrades and hardware improvements. Their weapons are modular and may be switched from meck to Meck before any battle. Their command structure differs from human methods as well, owing to their networked nature. No distance to calculate for Command Points!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meck Wars is not a stand-alone game. You need a copy of Injurius Games to play Meck Wars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
