			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyber.net.ica(CNI) takes place in a reality very similar to our own, with some slight modifications of course. Cyberspace is alive and tangible. Humans now have access to &amp;ldquo;jack&amp;rdquo; their brains into Cyberspace and experience it not just in 3D and surround sound but as if it were real life. To some it is just that. All it took for some was a few inexpensive home brew motherboards and computer components, with a bit of hacking. Others found the Cyberspace to be truly alive and could tap into the spirit of that new realm through mysticism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a set of variant cyberpunk rules for the Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls RPG created by Ken St. Andre.  It is a source book or sandbox environment using the rules of the Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls role playing game, created by Ken St. Andre and published by Flying Buffalo Inc., or combined with Mercenaries, Spies, and Private Eyes, written by Michael Stackpole and also published by FBI. The contents and concepts inside this book are meant to be used by Game Masters in whole or in part as they see fit. Like Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls, GMs are encouraged to use this material to create their own virtual realities for their players to play in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
