			<description>Housewarming is a simple card game for two to four players.  You're trying to fill the four rooms of your house with decor, furnishings, pets, and other miscellaneous items to increase how Stylish, Comfortable and generally Cool your house is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game you can Work (to earn bucks to buy stuff), Tempt Fate (to roll on the events chart), Go Shopping (to look for stuff you (or other players) may want to buy), or Rearrange Furniture (to optimize your house or get rid of stuff you don't want).  Your goal is to end the game with the highest average of Style and Comfort with the lowest difference between the two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Housewarming uses a custom card deck, an events chart, and several dice and tokens.  A four-player game takes about 40 minutes to play.  Although the topic isn't nearly as relevant for them as it is for a couple buying its first home, Housewarming is appropriate for mid-teens and older.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Housewarming is a free print-and-play game.  It is available at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/381/housewarming&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/381/housewarming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
