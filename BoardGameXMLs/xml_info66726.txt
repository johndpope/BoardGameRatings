			<description>In &amp;quot;Tech Deck:  Dare to Skate Game&amp;quot;, players pretend to be a group of skateboarders competing in the X Games, or just a group of locals showing their stuff in order to be crowned King of the Skatepark.  Each player chooses a Tech Deck fingerboard and performs a trick in the special Skatepark &lt;br/&gt;according to the card drawn.  This is the way you move around the game board.  If you can't perform the trick, you must wait until your next turn and try another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landing on a &amp;quot;Wipeout&amp;quot; makes you draw a card from that stack, but you can act goofy and have a lot of fun (plus you get to move a free space).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Challenge&amp;quot; cards allow you a one time challenge with another player.  If you can get to the finish before the other players do, you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The manual dexterity is fun, and you can honestly tell your friends you did a 50-50 Grind with a Nosestall this morning, but you wiped out on the Tick Tock after your Wallride!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
