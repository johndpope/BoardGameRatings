			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your day stared poorly this morning and you aren't certain if it has gotten better or worse since then. It started as a gloomy, overcast day, the kind where you don't want to do much of anything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You had just finished breaking fast when a company of the city watch came and asked you to accompany him to the District Guardhouse. You weren't being arrested; the Senior Constable of the Investigative Department of the watch had asked to see you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Senior Constable didn't waste any time and got straight to the point. The Ambassador of Thesk&amp;rsquo;s daughter had been kidnapped two days ago. There have been no demands and no one has claimed responsibility but the Ambassador has seen two people lately who he had exiled from Thesk twenty years ago and feels they might be responsible. Now, do you have any questions before you begin your investigation?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
