			<description>Southeast of Perth Western Australia, lies the little timber town of Yarloop. Behind it are the forests of the Darling Ranges. For more than 100 years, the people of Yarloop milled timber from that forest, brought to their saw mills by a network of tramways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yarloop is a tile laying game where players try to place their worker on newly discovered timber coups or the expanding tram network in an effort to score points faster than everyone else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has one meeple.  The Draw stack contains only 15 double sided tiles.  Once the stack is empty, players pick up a tile that is already placed, flip it over and place it in new position on the map.  They may then move their meeple and check for scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first to score 40 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
