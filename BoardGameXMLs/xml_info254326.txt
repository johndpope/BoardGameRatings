			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, you've agreed to run a game today and you have not had time to even think about an adventure. Don't freak out. We have you covered. This document is all that you need. Run this adventure. It will be over in one session. Then you can get back to your own evil machinations next session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many have heard the songs sung by the bards about Justin the Vindicator and the heroic deeds that he performed with his magical sword, Dragontongue. But the sword once had a different name when it was forged by the dwarves and was used by their own in defense of their lands. Now the dwarves want Dragontongue returned to them. But where is the sword now?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most records show that Dragontongue was buried with the knight in a great burial mound. Jostin belonged to a knightly order, The Guardians of the Reach. They built the vast burial mound to commemorate their fellow knight. The location of the memorial was almost forgotten. Ancient records purport to show where it stands. All that the heroes need to do is to get inside and find Dragontongue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is designed for four to five heroes of first level. It is written for adventurers just starting their career and also for players who are new to roleplaying games, especially younger people. It uses 5th Edition SRD rules as a default.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
