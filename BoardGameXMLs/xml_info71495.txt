			<description>&amp;quot;Many decades ago, mankind conquered the stars. With the development of advanced space craft, new worlds and intelligent life-forms were discovered within and beyond the Solar system. However, space travel was restricted to military personnel and scientists despite its conveniences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2035AD, they decided to unify all life-forms in outer space, but an interplanetary war started in 2041AD, with Earth involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2044AD, Galactic Command (GALCOM) was formed to maintain law and order amongst planets. The Gammulan race opposed the alliance and war was waged between GALCOM and Gammulans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 3000AD, player was recruited to defend the GALCOM consortium of planets against Gammulans. At 02:34:22 intergalactic time, A GALCOM diplomatic craft developed a navigational malfunction and strayed into Gammulan territory. GALCOM supreme commander Stranix reported a Sphinx class battlecruiser was intentionally destroyed by Gammulan orbital defence system, with no survivors. Meanwhile, a team of Renegade class interceptors ambushed a Gammulan starfighter in GALCOM sector 04:66-B.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Battlecruiser_3000AD,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
