			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GRAINVILLE-SUR-ODON, 27 June 1944: The Cameronians expected to find Grainville cleared by 11th Armoured Division. This expectation was confirmed by a squadron of the Fife and Forfars who believed the village was clear of infantry but warned of the possibility of enemy tanks. Fond hopes were rudely shattered at 20:00 hours, as D Company moved into the ruins, supported by two troops of 7th RTR. The place was enemy held, opposition was heavy, and three of the Churchills were quickly knocked out. All through the long summer&amp;rsquo;s evening, the battle raged to and fro over the ruins of the small town. Finally, the Cameronians and their supporting armour pulled back for the night, and shortly after so did the Germans. At midnight, the Cameronians&amp;rsquo; M.O. and Padre ventured into the rubble to search for their wounded and found Grainville deserted. The Cameronians would be back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raise your hand ... or optionally SHOUT to your mates for a Projecter Infantry Anti Tank (aka &amp;quot;PIAT) ... if you like the idea of a SIX FOOT LONG historical map with campaign game and macro scenario to play on it. Oops, that pretty much means you're shouting at the top of your lungs for a copy of ATS OMAHA or BERLIN from CH ... we just can't get past the desire to provide you the longest, largest tactical-level battlefields this side of joining a pile of geomorphs at a convention (may we suggest the new Museumfest in Michigan). If you wanted to know if the new British in Normandy releases, i.e., the new editions of the maps ... connect, the answer is &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;. If you wanted to know if these new editions, unlike their predecessors, total about 6' in length ... again, check. Affirmative. Yes. If you want to know what it feels like to collect your Panzerkampfwagen Vg platoon around a hamlet ... and stare over a klick away in game distance .... and order your cardboard Frundsbergers ... panzer marsch! You'll need to mount up and take to the turret in the form of a copy of SHOUT FOR PIATS ... and ORDERS FOR THE MAJOR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course if you want to know what it's like to order your Firefly troop (complete with AFVs bearing a troop leader pennant, see the sample directly above) ... to stop the jerries from going anywhere, let alone forward ... we suggest OFM and SFP ... on the double! Either way, you'll note the road signage says 'this way to Hill 112' and 'this way to Villers Bocage' ... both places that are in hand and coming from CH to build an unprecedented British in Nornandy collection of tactical-level modules ... start engines!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
