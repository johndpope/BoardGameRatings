			<description>The game consists of two packs of 30 cards. Each card has a picture on one side and a description on the other.&lt;br/&gt; One pack of cards is spread out picture side up so that all pictures can be seen. The other pack is stacked picture side up. The game starts by turning over the top card of the stack so that the descritipion can be read. Somewhere amongst the pictures showing is the item matching this description but finding the match may not be as easy as it seems as the pictures have been chosen so as to appear to be something else and a little imagination may be needed to make the match. Whoever makes the match first takes both cards and then the next stack card is turned over and a new match has to be found. When all cards in the stack have been used, whoever has the most cards in the winner. The game rules state that it is for two players or teams but clearly any number can play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
