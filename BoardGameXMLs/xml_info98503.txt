			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a very straightforward version of chess. Players can play either single-player (vs CPU), local multi, or network multi. The CPU is balanced and flexible. Each game will be a little different when playing against the CPU. Sometimes the opponent will be cautious, sometimes aggressive, and sometimes a little of both. Online multi allows for voice and camera integration. The player can either play multi-player in real time, or as &amp;quot;Message Chess&amp;quot; wherein the player trades moves with an opponent over the course of a longer period of time. A notification will great the player each time they sign in to the game, if the opponent has made a move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a few different themes that can be chosen for the board and pieces, but they do not alter the gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
