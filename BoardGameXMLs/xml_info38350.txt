			<description>Property was published in A Gamut of Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is played with an 8x8 squares grid and a deck of common cards. Also, each player have some money at his disposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are divided, being the numbers used to determine coordinates (black are the lines and red the columns)on the grid and the figures to represent buying power of the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his turn, a player plays two cards corresponding to a coordinate in the grid. If that square is empty, he take possession of it, if that square belongs to another player, he must pay a rent to that player, and after that, has a chance to buy that square with his figures cards.
