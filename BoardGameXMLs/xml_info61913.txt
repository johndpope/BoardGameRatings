			<description>A study of the finer points of subterranean combat in magic pants&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the forward:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tunnel Wars is a game about subterranean combat in magic metal&lt;br/&gt;pants. It's a good idea. Trust me.&lt;br/&gt;Tunnel Wars uses only one ordinary six sided die, like you find in casinos and boardgames. You can use one made of diamonds, if you have one. Otherwise, you should probably use one made of wood or plastic.&lt;br/&gt;Characters in Tunnel Wars are humanoids taking part in the bloody struggle for the copper needed to give their side an edge in the brutal conflict. The war is almost entirely subterranean; the few above ground battles that have occurred took place at the mouthes of tunnels on high mountain peaks, far away from civilization.&lt;br/&gt;As such, the secret of pantscomancy and of the value of copper is known only to the goblins and dwarves. Humans, elves, and all the other unimportant surface dwellers are blissfully unaware of copper's value, and are eager to take advantage of the apparent surge in copper's popularity underground, by trading it to dwarves and goblins at slightly increased prices (still well below it's real value).&lt;br/&gt;Both goblins and dwarves commonly tell surface dwellers that copper is a new fashion trend and nothing more. So far, nobody seems to have noticed how unusual it is for goblins and dwarves to suddenly have developed a sense of fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
