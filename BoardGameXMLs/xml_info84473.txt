							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Macbeth</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written between 1606 and 1607, Macbeth is one of William Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s greatest tragedies, rivaled only by Hamlet and King Lear. Set in the tumultuous and somewhat barbaric eleventh century of Scotland, the play tells the story of a heroic warrior, Macbeth, who is driven into a bloody series of murders and horror by his own unbridled ambition and the supernatural forces of darkness, manifested in the form of fatal prophecies. However, as one sees his actions become increasingly vile and depraved, one is still reminded of his humanity and former worth by the pangs of guilt which he suffers in moments of solitude and by the strong bonds of love that connect him to his equally ambitious wife. Herein we realize that the tragedy is not the murders of kings, friends, and children, or the havoc caused by civil war. It is, in fact, the knowledge that a hero has succumbed to the weaknesses inherent in the human race and, embracing wickedness, becomes a villain. This RPG sourcebook focus on the history and setting of this well known Shakespeare piece and how to integrate it into your regular local gaming session. This sourcebook also comes with several adventures seed with different endings to this classic play. You have read the dramatic piece, now play the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
