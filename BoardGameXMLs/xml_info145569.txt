			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the products in the Super Genius Presents line is the strong vision of a single game designer, bypassing some of the normal planning, development, and revision process used for most Super Genius Games products. While we consider those processes to be a major part of maintaining a high level of compatibility, quality, and balance in our main product lines, we also know that sometimes a writer has a strong vision that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exactly match the style of our company, or that the designer doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be diluted through normal development processes. In those cases, if we believe in the skill and vision of the designer, we now have the option of presenting their work without laying claim to it as part of one of our standard product lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While most Super Genius Games products are the carefully developed work of a team (even when there&amp;rsquo;s only one designer, the input of the whole Super Genius staff is likely to have effected the product), Super Genius Presents are the editorial pages, the solo rants, and the soapboxes. As a company we&amp;rsquo;re giving individual creators a chance to present their ideas more directly to the consumer. As commercial works we&amp;rsquo;ll try to ensure such products are professionally produced and edited, but the tone, content, and voice are largely under the control of the authors (though we do offer our opinions, and ultimately have final say in any product we produce).&lt;br/&gt;On Kitsune&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Kitsune&amp;rdquo;, sometimes translated as &amp;lsquo;fox folk&amp;rsquo;, is a blanket term used by society to describe a number of ostensibly-related fox-like shapeshifters who settle both amongst themselves on the fringes of human societies or quietly mingle in it, in the same way that &amp;ldquo;elf&amp;rdquo; might describe a city-dwelling high elf, a forester wood elf, or their more untrustworthy subterranean drow kin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
