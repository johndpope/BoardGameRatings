			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the American bicentennial&amp;mdash;Fourth of July, 1976. The residents of Hollywood, Florida are preparing for a night of fireworks and friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A band of kids are playing in the water near the city&amp;rsquo;s boardwalk. Without warning, a riptide clamps down and drags a handful out toward the ocean at an incredible speed. They yell and scream for help, but it&amp;rsquo;s too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That evening, the kids who were swept away awaken on the beach. They stand up and look around, confused. Everything looks the same, yet different. They make their way home to discover it&amp;rsquo;s now July 4, 1986&amp;mdash;they&amp;rsquo;ve been missing for a decade. Their friends and families are older; everything feels wrong. The doctors and police seem bewildered by the anomaly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Word of the missing kids gets the attention of the National Space Institute&amp;rsquo;s security team. Dr. Stephanie Nordling, director of the team at NSI, is especially interested in how these missing kids seem to have appeared within the same time frame as a strange alien vessel that was discovered just off the coast of Hollywood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The kids need to find a way home, while the vessel needs to find its own way home. Hopefully, they&amp;rsquo;ll find a way to get what they both need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
