			<description>Slapstick! is a game in which players move their pieces around a board in an attempt to simulate the slapstick comedies of 1930s Hollywood.  The game represents these events, e.g. slipping on banana skins, encountering crazy gorillas, pie fights, etc., in the form of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts from a corner of the board (which is divided into rooms) and with 2 cards of each type of comedic act in his or her hand.  Going in turns, they roll a die to move their tokens and attempt to get rid of their cards.  Certain acts, such as those for pie fights, can be passed to players whose tokens are within range.  Others can only be passed to players whose tokens are in the same room or are laid down as traps (a player whose token passes over them has to pick them up).  The player who empties his or her hand of cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
