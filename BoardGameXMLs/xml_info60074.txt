							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Swords Against Sorcery</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swords Against Sorcery is designed for 3-5 characters of either Beginning or Seasoned levels of experience, as detailed on page 103 of RuneQuest. Whether the Games Master wishes this to be the first adventure for the group or carry over characters from his own plotlines is unimportant. Both types of adventurers will work equally well in the following scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, if characters wish to tie the events of Swords Against Sorcery into the earlier published adventure, Swords Across Nehwon (in the Nehwon sourcebook) then it adds another dimension to the storyline. After all, the characters will have already encountered several of the Non-Player Characters that crop up here, such as Sheelba, Helena and Jahol. If the Games Master is running this scenario directly after the events of Swords Across Nehwon, the story is set one month after the previous adventure. &lt;br/&gt;in this scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
