			<description>Pencil Whipped might be the most well known of the Pie in the Sky games and one of the only ones to utilize a later version of the engine and thus running on Microsoft Windows. The game won developer Lonnie Flickinger (aka Chiselbrain Software) a chance at the $15,000 Seumas McNally Grand Prize and awards for technical excellence, game design, visual art, and audio. Based on a strange dream Flickinger had, the game became known for its unique black and white pencil drawn world and for its wider novelty value, being described by Wired.com as &amp;quot;like being trapped inside a very disturbed child's drawing.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pie in the Sky (game engine)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
