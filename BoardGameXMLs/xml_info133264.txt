							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">AHR1: Last Stand of Tyrurk</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module includes maps, new monsters, and a complete description of an adventure to form a ready-to-run AHR: Axe, Hammer &amp; Rune game with minimum preparation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last Stand of Tyrurk is an adventure module suitable for beginning characters with at least one cliche at level 4. In this adventure, the characters find themselves on the search for a long forgotten Dwarven outpost in the Dire Peaks which is said to contain a valuable treasure. These brave adventures must face roving bands of Goblin wolf-riders, giants, and possibly worse before they will complete their mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Axe, Hammer, &amp;amp; Rune is a combat focused setting, it is expected that all characters pursuing this quest will be able to hold their own in a fight, but there are plenty of opportunities for role-playing as well, so well rounded characters are encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary: Game play starts at the Dwarven outpost of Tomsol, a lonely little garrison in the Howling Plains whose mission is to watch for Goblin incursions. A little town has built up around Tomsol. There, the characters meet with a mysterious benefactor who outlines the possible whereabouts of Ulfbet, a lost outpost in the Dire Peaks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As legend goes, the captain of the guard, a Dwarf named Tyrurk, commanded his garrison to flee in order to save their lives during the fall. He stayed behind to buy the garrison time, and presumably died doing so. With him was his rune covered rifle, Sylkyr.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters are charged with following the clues, finding Ulfbet, recovering Sylkyr, and sending a message to the Goblins...there time has come to an end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
