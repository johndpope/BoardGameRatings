			<description>Players purchase businesses and receive a Return On Investment (ROI) for each business owned. Each &amp;ldquo;ROI&amp;rdquo; is based on the risk associated with that business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unpredictable dynamics are created by the &amp;ldquo;News&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Fate&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Cashspiracy&amp;rdquo; cards which introduce world events affecting business owners throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players request Lines of Credit from the World Bank to increase their &amp;ldquo;Return On Investment&amp;rdquo;. However, as in real life, discretion must be used with credit! While not costing anything initially, a $50,000 interest payment must be made for each Line of Credit each time a player goes around the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player must maintain a passport to buy businesses and to collect &amp;ldquo;ROI&amp;rdquo;. If a player loses their passport, their income rights are revoked. But, they are still required to pay their debts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player becomes the winner by surviving the world events, by using their cash and credit wisely, and by outperforming the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
