			<description>From the press release:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new for 2007 game features drivers who qualified for The 2007 Chase for the NASCAR Nextel Cup, which is NASCAR&amp;rsquo;s version of playoffs. The 12 drivers who are highlighted in the game along with their race cars are: Jimmie Johnson, Jeff Gordon, Tony Stewart, Carl Edwards, Kurt Busch, Denny Hamlin, Martin Truex Jr., Matt Kenseth, Kyle Busch, Jeff Burton, Kevin Harvick and Clint Bowyer. The drivers were determined Sept. 8 after the Chevy Rock and Roll 400 race at Richmond International Speedway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players race around the racetrack game board, trying to be the first to cross the finish line for the 10 races that make up The Chase. They collect chips for the races they win, and the player with the most race chips at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along the way, players try to avoid the Crash Zone and Pit Road but zoom forward when they land on a Drafting Advantage space or play a Pass Card. The game board also has several Chase Challenge spaces, which might help lucky players take the lead or avoid a crash. Players who aren&amp;rsquo;t so lucky might be warned about changing track conditions or a tire that&amp;rsquo;s losing air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
