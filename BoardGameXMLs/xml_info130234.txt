			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Ardennes, soldier! Well, we're finally here. In the past few years we've seen the US Army fight its way through the rocky hills of Tunisia and Sicily, painfully crawl up the boot of Italy, storm bloody Omaha Beach, and sweep across the France in what has been described as an 'American Blitzkrieg'. Its now the end of 1944 and that same army, for all of its hard-earned victories, is at the end of its tether. Fuel and supplies are only just arriving in force, the men are exhausted, and the raw recruits are fresher than ever. For the US Army, December was a time to pause briefly to rebuild their stocks and prepare for the final drive into Germany. This opened a very small window of opportunity for the Germans to launch an ambitious offensive with the best troops they could muster. The plan called for an all-out attack through the Ardennes to capture Antwerp, cutting off and capturing several Allied armies, and forcing a peace settlement in Germany's favour. No one, including Hitler himself, was under any delusions about the cost of failure in the up coming operation. For the Germans, it was all or nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
