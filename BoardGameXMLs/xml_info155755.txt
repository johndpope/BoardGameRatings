							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cave Escape</name>
									
			<description>Cave Escape is a push-your-luck dice game for 2 to 6 players where people are in a cavern that is about to collapse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are working to be the first to escape from a 5,000ft deep cavern while making sure that no one gets out before them by sabotaging the other players. The first player to get their meeple top the 5,000ft mark is the winner and survives - the rest of the players are dead. Sorry!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game adds a cutthroat twist to traditional push-your-luck mechanisms for you can sabotage another player's roll so that they lose it all or force them to quit rolling. It also allows players to get farther faster with special dice that they can purchase on their turn with adrenaline tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
