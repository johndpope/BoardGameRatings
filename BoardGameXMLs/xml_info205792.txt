			<description>Embargo is a pick up and delivery game with play mechanics similar to Monopoly or Easy Money, but laced with political jabs...just look at the box cover. The game challenges players to deliver 9 barrels of oil to a port in each country, while trying to avoid going broke. Landing on a competitor&amp;rsquo;s port (occupied by their colored barrel) makes you roll and multiply the dice together, then multiply them again by one thousand- ultimately paying that cost to the owner of that port.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the goal is to deliver a barrel to each country you can forego that objective by placing all your barrels as strategically as possible, hoping to bankrupt the other players. This is a risky endeavor since you are preventing yourself the opportunity of an outright win, and you may end up going broke yourself while pursuing the rapid acquisition of ports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 4 players, ships are divided into pairs which navigate the oceans in opposite directions. Collisions with other ships are just one of the hazards when seafaring around the globe. Landing on an &amp;quot;Embargo&amp;quot; space causes you to pay $25,000 or lose your precious cargo of oil. Choosing the latter causes you to lose a turn the next time you want to reacquire another barrel of oil. Other spaces can reward you with a cash payout, which you can possibly double or triple with another roll of the dice...but beware, the wrong dice roll means you get nothing. Some spaces allow you to draw a card, most of which are fortuitous but some will be detrimental to your pocketbook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Money can be tight in this game unless you land on a money space or the start space (yes, passing start nets you nothing), you draw a card or you have other players land on your ports. The player that delivers 9 barrels first or forces everyone else into bankruptcy is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
