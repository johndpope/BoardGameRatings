			<description>Get ready to add some spice to your game night with Spicy Games! Each of the spice bottles hold all of the pieces you need to play a game. Each game takes 2 minutes to learn and 10 minutes to play. For ages 8 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, they shake up the bottle containing the 19 discs that are white (salt) on one side and black (pepper) on the other and then pour all them out calling out either Salt or Pepper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They score 1 point for each token that came out on the side they called out. Those go back in the bottom while the others are set off to the side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They repeat the process and may call out a different color with the remaining tokens. A player continues to do this until there are no more tokens in the bottle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a few other special rules for outcomes based on what side of the tokens come out (all the same side, 7 or more of the same color. etc)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First player to 100 points win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
