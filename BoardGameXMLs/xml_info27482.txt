			<description>The players jointly build the board, one tile at a time, as the game progresses. Each time a player places a tile that forms a group of three or four like-colored tiles, that player receives points, with the quantity depending on the group configuration and on chameleon (pawn) positions on the board. If a player places a tile adjacent to a wasp (die), he loses points to the wasp&amp;rsquo;s owner. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was an entry to the Mesomorph 1 Piecepack Contest, and is designed for a standard piecepack with a four seasons expansion and pawn saucers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
