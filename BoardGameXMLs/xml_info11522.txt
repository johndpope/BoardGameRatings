			<description>A roll-and-move children's game about being invited to birthday parties, buying presents, and delivering them. Players move around the board trying to draw a party invitation to one of four parties. Then they must go to the gift shop and buy a present, take it to the party, and collect a balloon before they leave. After they have acquired a balloon from each of the four parties, they must race their friends home to win the game. Comes with four exclusive Polly Pocket figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
