							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Witch Hunter</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many fantasy worlds magic is the greatest power in creation. A single man with sufficient arcane might can rout armies, topple castles, and undo the laws of nature. Faced with such terrible power, ordinary folk turn to those brave, skilled, or crazy enough to hunt down and eliminate sorcerers. These few are known as Witch Hunters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Benefitting from extensive training, preternatural talent, or good old-fashioned willpower, Witch Hunters can both detect and defy magical power. These rare and deadly talents ensure these adventurers are in constant and high demand, and many among their ranks find employment as mercenaries and special agents of the crown. No matter who employs a Witch Hunter or what his or her methods, however, when it comes to persecuting sorcerers there is no judge, jury, or executioner better equipped for the job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the campaign, an Witch Hunter could be...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A puritanical warrior who cuts down casters with cutlass and flintlock&lt;br/&gt;    A canny tribal hunter blessed and sent forth by his people to slay a fearsome enemy wizard&lt;br/&gt;    A skeptical killer whose disbelief shields him against spells of all types&lt;br/&gt;    A Church inquisitor tasked with scouring the blight of magic from the world&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This master class expansion also includes seven new feats, including the Mage Hunter Spellcasting feat, a Basic Combat feat chain allowing you to overcome and eventually benefit from dire situations, and a Terrain feat chain focusing on the art of stalking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
