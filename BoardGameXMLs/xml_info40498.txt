			<description>Italian indoor cycling game published in August 1967.&lt;br/&gt;Movement is not determined by dice but by counters although there is a die in the game but that is used to win counters instead of to advance on the track. There are three kind of counters: a red one for energy, a yellow one for sprint (they can only be played in the upper corners) and a blue one for a burst of speed. There are 4 different races in the game: Velocita (Sprint), Inseguimento (Pursuit), Traguardi (Points race) and Eliminazione (an elimination race).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
