			<description>Designer Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For ages, the studious inhabitants of Cogsburg lived without fear, happily ticking along as they went about their business. But now a freak accident has occurred at the Cogtower, scattering cogs all over town and sending the clockwork winders into chaos. The Cogmen must repair the Cogtower before it is too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player directs a handful of resourceful Cogmen to gather cogs and repair the Cogtower. Each turn, a Winding card will be drawn from the deck, and any Cogmen standing adjacent to a Winder will be wound up by that amount, gaining Energy. Once all the Winding cards have been used, a Rainy Day card is added and the deck is reshuffled. If a Rainy Day card is drawn, any Cogmen who don&amp;rsquo;t find shelter will get wet and rust (a terrible fate!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beginning with the starting player, players take turns moving all of their Cogmen, who must spend Energy to move. At the end of the turn, any Cogmen dangerously low on Energy (and not near a Winder) may make a Desperation move, one last push towards a Winder before becoming unwound. A Cogman that becomes unwound is inoperable until he is wound up by an ally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cogmen gather the cogs that are scattered about Cogsburg, returning them to the Cogtower to gain victory points, or he may choose to repair a broken/rusted Cogman instead. A Cogman can only carry a single cog at a time (They&amp;rsquo;re very heavy!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the Cogtower has been rebuilt, final scores are tallied. Each player recieves one Victory Point for every cog they supplied to the Cogtower, plus an additional point for each operable Cogman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic game is for two players. Rules for three players and four-player team play are included. Official rules for entirely cooperative play are forthcoming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
