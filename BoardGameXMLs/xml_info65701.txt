			<description>Players draw three out of 190 cards with buildings, landmarks, food, sports or other items connected to a European country. At a player`s  turn, he describes one of his cards, but rather vaguely and personal, but still unambiguously (he can for instance also use his feelings, like: &amp;quot;I will never climb up THERE!&amp;quot; (Eiffel Tower)) without naming them directly. Then they place three rings onto a map of Europe, one of them including the flag of the country his item is connected with. The other players now place their pawns into the ring they think includes the correct flag. The item is revealed and the players score points tracked down around the map. The player whose pawn surrounds he map twice first, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
