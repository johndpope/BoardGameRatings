			<description>World Dumbination is a funny political war game for 2 - 5 players. The game was inspired by world leaders acting like children arguing in a sandpit, and that is the idea for the cover art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story: Our planet has for decades been monitored by alien species. Worried by the latest events, their enormous spaceships head for earth to save us from things to come. As they&amp;rsquo;ve already made a copy of our planet, they have come to pick up the intelligent people to inhabit this new world, leaving the &amp;ldquo;less gifted&amp;rdquo; behind. Most of the world leaders get on board, but some didn&amp;rsquo;t make the cut &amp;ndash; for more or less obvious reasons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In World Dumbination you play as these five leaders in a quest for world domination. You can choose to play as the leader of the USA, Venezuela, Turkey, Russia &amp;ndash; or, of course, North Korea. It&amp;rsquo;s never been easier to conquer the world. Will you make it to world domination, or will you all destroy the planet in a nuclear super-shower&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even if there are a lot of military leaders remaining, you need to build your military forces from scratch. Reaching your ultimate goals makes you able to draw stronger cards. The goals are different for each nation. USA is of course building a wall. The leader of Turkey wants to become a dictator. If you play Russia you want to be back in the U.S.S.R. The leader of Venezuela needs to get more popular so he stays in power, and North Korea main goal is to become a feared nuclear superpower!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find the best strategy to move your forces and build military bases (that decide the strength of your units). Interact and make deals with the other players through diplomacy or corruption. The players choose and place cards to reveal them all at the same time. Play action and project cards that strengthen yourself or weakens the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While doing all this, you also have to watch out for your ego and popularity levels. With too little self-esteem you don&amp;rsquo;t dare to do any action. Too much ego makes you crazy and focused on only one target (you have to almost be crazy to use the nuclear bomb).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you get to unpopular, you as a leader can be overthrow by the other players, or by your own government. By getting very popular you get a bonus income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are geniuses (those who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get on the spaceships) still hiding on Earth. Finding one or two of them would also help you in your quest for world domination. You can also find things that the aliens left behind who will give you an advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In case the players get too clever, there are Dumbness cards in the mix to make sure some kind of stupidity will take place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You win by having the most victory points at a certain amount of rounds (that you decide before playing), or by being the only leader left with bases or units on the board. You get points by building projects and military bases, conquering new areas and become popular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is all about having fun around the table, weirdly it is quite fun to use dirty politics and engage in a nuclear war against the other players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
