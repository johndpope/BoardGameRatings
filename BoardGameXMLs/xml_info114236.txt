							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blue Peter Explorer</name>
									
			<description>This is a great game for all ages but especially for children who are fans of the BBC programme Blue Peter, which has been on for so many years, it is now an institution. In true Blue Peter style, it is fun and educational,&lt;br/&gt;When you answer a question correctly you are given a piece of your jigsaw and the aim is to complete your jigsaw of the world first. The questions are on the people and places that Blue Peter has explored during the programme's history.&lt;br/&gt;The questions range from quite easy to challenging but children are guarranteed to learn some facts while they play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
