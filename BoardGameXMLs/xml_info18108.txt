							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wild Bill Hickok&#039;s the Cavalry and the Indians Game</name>
									
			<description>One person plays the Indians and the other the Cavalry.  The gameboard has a fort which houses the 12 cavalry markers while on the opposite side of the board an Indian village houses the 12 Indians.  A one-way path winds around the board, with the Indians moving in one direction, while the cavalry move in the opposite, which means they'll come head to head in a short while.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Indians player leads off, spinning the spinner, which has values of 0 to 10; the player moves his first marker accordingly.  The cavalry player follows in suit.  On the next Indian spin, the player moves the Indian marker already in play and adds a new one from the village, each moving the distance the spinner indicates. Play continues on with each player soon moving several of his markers on each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each marker counts for 10 men, and there are several spaces scattered across the board which, when landed upon, indicate you must lose 10 men.  Essentially, that marker is removed from the game, not to return.  Also, when a player lands on an opponent's marker, he captures that piece and moves into his fort or village.  Additionally, a few spaces allow a player to raid his opponent's fort or village and re-capture his captured markers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually, through such attrition, one player will find he has no markers left out on the trail.  At that point, if he is holding some of his opponent's markers captive, he may trade his captives for his own markers, place them in his respective fort or village, and move them into play as normal.  If, however, a player has no markers on the trail, and no captives in his fort or village, he loses the game, giving his opponent the victory.  Thus, the markers have no end destination and may move round and round the board, victory coming only when the opponent has lost all of his markers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
