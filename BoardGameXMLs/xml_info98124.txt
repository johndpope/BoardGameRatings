			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This arcade inspired video game by Big Five Software was their first release to include digitized voices. This was in keeping with the game's inspiration, the arcade game Berzerk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls an animated figure that moves through a series of electrified mazes. The mazes are populated by robots that attempt to run into the player. The player must shoot or evade the robots and exit one of the openings at the top, bottom or sides of the screen. Running into a wall or robot will cost the player one life, as will getting shot by one of the robots (who start shooting back on higher levels). Bonus points are awarded for destroying all robots before exiting the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The iconic Big Five Flagship makes an appearance if the player spends too much time on one screen. The Flagship cannot be shot and can move through walls, heading directly and continuously toward the player. The player loses a life if touched by the Flagship. However, the Flagship also destroys any robots that it runs into.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
