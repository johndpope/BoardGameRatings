			<description>from the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hot sands of the Egyptian desert are spotted with great stone pyramids. These monuments pay homage to great Kings like Tut, Ramsses and Amenhotep. Their rich treasures and mumified remains are guarded by unsolvable mazes, secret passages and mysterious curses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One lesser known pyramid stands apart from the rest. It is the tomb of King Tutanskoop. Tutanskoop had been King for three weeks when he was caught erasing 18 minutes of hieroglyphics from the court records. As a punishment he was cursed to spend eternity wondering his tomb, picking up Tanna leaves while being chased by vicious Tumble Bugs. His only reward for his labor is another maze, more leaves and more Tumble Bugs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tumble Bugs is a fast, Hi-Resolution arcade game. It is challenging, addicting and fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
