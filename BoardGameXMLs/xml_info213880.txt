			<description>MAKERS, the game of making incredible products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Makers is a card game for 2 to 4 players, in which you will have to satisfy the largest number of customers by building the products that best suit their tastes and needs. Hurry up in making your products and meet as many customers as you can before the other makers. At the end of the game that maker with more product chips, will be our &amp;quot;handyman&amp;quot; winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PREPARATION&lt;br/&gt;Distribute 4 product tokens to each player / maker: 1 coin (yellow), 1 Gear (blue), 1 flower (green) and 1 diamond (red). Leave the rest, next to the Fault tokens (black), within reach of all players / makers. Add the 4 service cards. Shuffle the customer cards and put them all face down on the table creating a series of 4 batteries. Turn over the first customer cards each of the batteries.&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the product cards and deal 5 to each maker. Leave the rest mouth down on the table forming the deck of products. On your side and on your back will create the battery discards, which we will call recycling pile. Whether exhausts the product mallet blends the recycling stack and forms with it a new product mallet. The maker who has recently performed some related activity with creativity or crafts begins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MECHANICS AND GAME DEVELOPMENT&lt;br/&gt;MAKERS is a card game that is developed in turns and in each one of them you can choose between several actions. At the end of your turn you must have at least 5 product cards in your hand, but you can only have 5 product cards in your playing area. In their respective shifts, the makers will try to complete products that demand customer letters using their own product cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PHASES OF THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;PHASE 1)&lt;br/&gt;In each round, the makers, by turns, can carry out any of the following actions in any order:&lt;br/&gt;1. Place a product card in your play area.&lt;br/&gt;2. Replace or send to the recycling stack any number of product cards you have on your play area.&lt;br/&gt;3. Use one of the 4 service letters, spending the corresponding product token.&lt;br/&gt;4. Discard any number of product cards in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;PHASE 2)&lt;br/&gt;Draw as many product cards as you need until you have at least 5 in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;PHASE 3)&lt;br/&gt;Turn to the maker on your left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
