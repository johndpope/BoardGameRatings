			<description>The designer is most noted for his statistical games that create games for sports not usually depicted in such games. Britain hardly ever developed stats games up to 1980 or so, and Gary filled the gap in the market by making games for Cricket and Soccer. However he must have felt that he had to make at least one American staple and so he published this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As usual with statistical games, all you need are two dice and all the charts and tables provided within the game. Thus you can try to replay a whole season (if you fancy playing over 1,000 games!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
