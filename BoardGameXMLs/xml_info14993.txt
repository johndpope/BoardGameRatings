							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">You Haven&#039;t Changed A Bit</name>
									
			<description>We have developed &amp;quot;You Haven't Changed a Bit&amp;quot;: a board game based on actual Golden Anniversary couples.  The object of the game is to match golden anniversary couples to their newlywed pictures. Stories on the backs of the photo cards provide a few clues to the matches and are real conversation starters; funny ways the couples met, how they have or haven&amp;rsquo;t changed over time, and their advice for achieving a long, happy marriage.  &lt;br/&gt; The game is ideal for parties, bridal showers, and as a gift. It provides a few laughs and sets expectations for young couples about what will and won&amp;rsquo;t change throughout their marriage. It helps bridge the gap between young and old generations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
