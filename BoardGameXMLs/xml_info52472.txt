			<description>From Publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blood is thicker than water, as they say. But what happens when people use ties of blood to exploit others? You may run into this problem in Monte Cook's new miniadventure, Thicker Than Water. In this module suitable for four 12th-level characters, one PC discovers a distant relative seeking help to complete a prophecy. Of course, things are never that easy -- particularly if the PC doesn't want to help?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Preview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Migos Fehr is the son of Charad, a mysterious air elemental creature somehow related to the Prince of Evil Air Elementals, Yan-C-Bin. Charad descended upon the material world about a century ago and, in the guise of a suave and dashing human, produced offspring with a number of mortal women, then he did the same thing again 30 years ago. Migos and his siblings all retain the traits of their supernatural father. Migos seeks the remaining carriers of Charad's bloodline. While he has found those from Charad's more recent visit, he also seeks those who descended from his actions long ago. He believes that people of his bloodline have a destiny (he calls it a &amp;quot;holy destiny&amp;quot;) and that they are generally superior to others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, he wants to fulfill an obscure prophecy called the Presage of Forms. This prophecy, originally spoken by the seer Talla 900 years ago, states that when six examples of the perfection of form gather together, they can unlock something called the Power Universal and gain access to its limitless might.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As it happens, Migos is completely wrong in thinking that the prophecy refers to his brethren, and he's made other mistakes as well, which you will discover later in this adventure. But, of course, he does not know this. (He wouldn't accept the notion of his errors even if someone told him or offered him proof?he's that convinced.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character Hooks and Running the Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an event-driven adventure, as opposed to a site-based one. Refer to the Dungeon Master's Guide, page 98, for a description of the difference. Basically, you can find here a number of events, all linked, to place in your campaign. You can space these events apart, with other encounters, events, or even whole adventures taking place between them. The amount of time between events depends mostly on the character hook used to get the PCs into the adventure and how much setup time you have...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
