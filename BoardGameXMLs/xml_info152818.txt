			<description>From the Kickstarter campaign:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of these 3 packs comes with 6 cards tailor made to expand the game in ways people have been asking about since the original release of DrunkQuest. Feel like there aren't enough Permanents in your game? Grab the Weapons Rack booster. Are you a professional drinker who wants to see Monster numbers soar to new heights? Coin Purse it is! Or, maybe you and your friends are cardgame pros that feel like you could handle extra depth and strategy to your game, even while booze clouds your mind. Then the Tactician's Bag is for you! In a later update we plan to go over each card in the 3 packs so stay tuned!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
