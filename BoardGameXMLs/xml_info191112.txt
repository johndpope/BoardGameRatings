			<description>Dubai is a fast set-collection game of speedy economy, tall towers, and savvy investments for 2 to 6 Architect Investors building and trading their way to be the wealthiest tower builder in the booming city of Dubai!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a board where each colour's value is tracked, as well as a 5-card face-up Market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players will either Take or Trade from the Market, Build a set of same-colour cards into a tower, which gains points but erodes that colour's value, or Invest in a colour by playing the colour cards in front of themselves, which increases that colour's value, and fights for share ownership of that colour. At the end of each phase, when towers are open for business, players with the most investments in the most represented colours are awarded ownership of the tower, and gains it for points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tower is considered complete if it has three different colours, and an existing colour can't be built into a tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over after three phases, with one, two and three towers' completion to end each phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;News Event cards appear from the deck that change up the game, but they don't resolve as surprises from the deck, but rather stay in the Coming Up pile until the next one is drawn, possibly giving time to prepare for the coming event. Or not! News is a fickle beast!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The full Print &amp;amp; Play &amp;amp; discussions can be found here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/21108398&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/21108398&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
