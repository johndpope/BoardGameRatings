			<description>Computer Ambush is a turn-based tactical wargame set in world war II. As sergeant Padooka of the US army, or German Feldwebel Kurt Reich, players must lead their squad to victory and eliminate the enemy patrol in the ruins of a French village in Normandy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is one of the first of its kind, taking into account the statistics and equipment of each soldier, line of sight, fatigue, morale, wounds...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by programming each soldier's actions for the turn (reload a weapon and fire, run across the street and throw a grenade...), then watching as the game resolves each actions simultaneously. The game ends with the defeat of one of the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a character editor and several scenarios, and can be played against the computer or a human opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Ed Williger and Larry Strawser&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
