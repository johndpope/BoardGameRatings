			<description>Back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your father a high elf, your mother human, you're not sure which world you really belong in.  Now your father has disappeared and as his son and heir must take control of his kingdom. But the evil elf Thornstabber is challenging your right to rule because you are half-human. Your fathers special power was over lightning, wind, and rain. Are you also a stormbringer? And can you learn to master this power in time to keep Thornstabber from conquering your lands? Learning to use your power-if you have any- will take the help of a high mage. Should you seek his aid and face the challenge of the weathermakers Old Man Wind, the Blue Dragon and the Weeping Lady? Or should you trust your own swordskills and human strength against Thornstabbers elfin magic?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
