			<description>The ancient evil has awakened, and the dungeon is collapsing. RUN!&lt;br/&gt;You've accidentally awakened an ancient evil, and now you're running for your life as the dungeon collapses around you! Rubble, monsters, and treasure are crashing down from the dungeon floor above, and the ancient evil is hot on your heels! Can you make it out of the dungeon alive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Scoot is a fast and fun game with easy to learn rules and quick gameplay. On your turn, play a &amp;quot;Scoot&amp;quot; card to show where you run, and increase your Panic to move even more. Watch out for the rubble and monsters dropping from the floor above, but try to scoop up that treasure as you run past! After each player's turn, draw from the &amp;quot;Collapse&amp;quot; pile and see what falls next...or whether the Ancient Evil advances. If he catches you, you're doomed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For advanced games, add in the &amp;quot;Alignment&amp;quot; cards, which give each character a secret goal, and change how victory points are scored at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With simple mechanics that elicit surprisingly complex interactions, the mad scramble to the dungeon exit becomes a quick but compelling light strategy game, perfect for repeat plays to satisfy that &amp;quot;just one more game&amp;quot; urge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enough talk! The evil is here! RUN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
