							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Armored Core 2: Another Age</name>
									
			<description>Armored Core 2: Another Age is a mecha video game in the Armored Core series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another Age is the last entry in the series to be set in the universe of the original Armored Core.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion to Armored Core 2 runs on the same game engine as its predecessor but features a number of changes in the way the game is played. There is no trial mission in Another Age that kicks the game off, the player is simply thrown into the world with their AC and their first job offer right there waiting for them. The Arena, which played a significant role in Armored Core 2 has been scaled back a bit, but a fair number of the game's missions involve one-on-one combat with other Ravens in a set-up not unlike Armored Core 2\'s Arena. Another Age has sparse expressed plot, it is more a portrait of the life of a mercenary, always bouncing about from place to place and not getting tied down to any one particular cause. Occasionally recurring elements pop up from time to time as the game progresses, but there is no defined storyline to the game. While there is virtually no storyline there are over 100 separate missions that make up the mass of the game, the largest Armored Core title to date, and each mission plays out in a specific area of the world map screen that would reappear in following AC titles down the road. Another Age is also noted for its cameo appearances. Past enemies from previous Armored Core games Stinger and Nineball appear as bosses in several special missions that are unlocked once you clear all 100 of the game's missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Armored Core 2: Another Age&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
