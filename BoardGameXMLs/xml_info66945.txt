			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mini Six is a fast and flexible rules system that encourages cinematic play. It's based on a popular multi-genre role playing game that was created in the 1980's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the rules you need for fast play are included on the first page. The following six densely packed pages present options and advanced rules such as character perks and complications, vehicles, magic, and stock characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanically, it is a clone of well-known system. We'd love to use the name of that system, but because we don't own the trademark or have permission to use it, we can't. The system was first used in a popular science fiction role playing game released in the 1980's. That system has been made open for use by it's owner, West End Games, but the standard trademark license (STL) to refer to that system has not been released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not exactly the same as the original system, however. Mini Six is a smaller, leaner game than the original. In addition, a few tweaks have been made here and there to streamline play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mini Six is just the rules. No setting is included, but we intend to release some of our own. It can be used to play just about any genre of game. A few examples of fantasy, science fiction, and modern game elements are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
