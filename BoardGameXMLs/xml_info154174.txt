							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Big Bang Theory: Rock! Paper! Scissors! Lizard! Spock! Dice Game</name>
									
			<description>The Rock! Paper! Scissors! Lizard! Spock! Dice Game contains 3 red dice, 1 black die, and 24 small chips. The object is to be the last player in the game who owns a chip or chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 3 chips. A player rolls the black die and places it in the center of the table. This is the die that all players will be competing against.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player rolls all three red dice. The player compares their dice to the black die, and loses chips for each die that is defeated by the center black die. They also pass a chip to the player on their left for every die that instructs them to do so. For every die that matches the black die in the center, the player passes a chip to the player on their right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all players have had a turn, the black die is rolled again, and a new round is begun. Play continues until only one player has chips remaining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
