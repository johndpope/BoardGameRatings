			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is quite flexible, supporting cooperative or competitive play, and also supporting open-ended campaigning or establishing victory conditions.  Most players will end up with numerous characters, most of them in supporting roles.  Characters are built from points pools, including Resources (loosely equivalent to Attributes in many respects), Skills, and Traits.  Action resolution involves a modified d% roll, with players trying to &amp;quot;roll under&amp;quot; a Skill rating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note the game begins with a &amp;quot;disclaimer&amp;quot; regarding religion and religious belief, as then proceeds to a lengthy historical introduction.  The game created something of a controversy when published; eventually forum comments were purged and disallowed for the game.  Many readers found the in-game portrayal of especially the Catholic church to be overly vituperative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
