			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Savage World of My Little Pony uses several Setting Rules found in the Savage Worlds Deluxe Edition, some of which are different from what is found in the core rules. Each Setting Rule is listed in full below; some of these are optional but strongly recommended for most games. Optional Setting Rules are noted as such in their individual entries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Contest of Wills&lt;br/&gt;The Savage World of My Little Pony adds a new system for combat using &amp;lsquo;Clash of Wills&amp;rsquo; attacks that can inflict &amp;lsquo;daunts&amp;rsquo; on your opponents in a similar fashion to attacks and wounds. These are explained in more detail in their own section on Combat as part of the Game Rules chapter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Critical Failures&lt;br/&gt;Optional; When a character rolls a &amp;lsquo;1&amp;rsquo; on both dice (snake eyes) on a Trait roll, they cannot spend a Benny to re-roll it and are stuck with the critical failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes Never Die&lt;br/&gt;Optional; With this rule in play, characters who would normally die are simply knocked out for a dramatically appropriate time instead. Only if the situation is particularly heroic, or if it serves as a major story point can characters actually die. For example, a character who tumbles off of a cliff in the midst of an epic battle with the adventure&amp;rsquo;s villain may catch onto a ledge and pull themselves to safety before blacking out. They are still &amp;lsquo;out&amp;rsquo; for that particular scene as if they had died, but they can eventually climb to safety. Conversely, villains are similarly hard to get rid of permanently and will find ways to escape or come back even after being defeated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No Power Points&lt;br/&gt;Instead of using Power Points, unicorns simply choose the spell they want to cast and make a Spellcraft roll. The penalty to the roll is specific to the spell itself.&lt;br/&gt;Once cast, check the results below:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Success: The spell activates as usual.&lt;br/&gt;     Raise: A raise on the roll grants additional bonuses to the spell stated in its description.&lt;br/&gt;     Failure: The spell does not activate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Backlash- There is no backlash effect if a unicorn rolls a &amp;lsquo;1&amp;rsquo; on their Spellcraft die.&lt;br/&gt;Maintaining Powers- Unicorns can maintain spells as long as desired up to the limit of their duration, but each spell maintained inflicts a &amp;ndash;1 penalty to cast any new spells. You may choose to cancel any number of maintained spells as a free action.&lt;br/&gt;Interrupting Powers- If a unicorn with an activated spell is Shaken or suffers a wound, daunt, or fatigue level, they must make a Smarts roll to maintain all their spells. If the roll is failed, all spells are instantly dropped. Maintained spells shut down automatically if the caster sleeps or is rendered unconscious.&lt;br/&gt;Spell Preparation- A unicorn may prepare a spell by concentrating for a round (no movement or other actions besides free actions and avoid interruption, as described above). If successful, they ignore 2 points of penalties on all spells cast with their next action. If they do not enact any spells on their next action, the preparation is lost.&lt;br/&gt;Cantrips- Cantrips do not normally require a Spellcraft roll to cast successfully (some can have Cast Options if you choose to roll as part of using the cantrip). However, any cantrips that you maintain inflict penalties as if they were maintained spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tenet Against Violence&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many roleplaying games prominently feature violence as one of the most important tools, if not the most important, at the disposal of the player characters. While this is a perfectly valid path (and makes for some exciting action and adventure) to take in a game, The Savage World of My Little Pony is meant to stay true to the show that created it. As such, the rules emphasize creative problem solving, storytelling, roleplaying, and teamwork over physical violence. In the show My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, the characters defeat terrifying monsters and villains all without the use of violence, even in the face of similar danger. Every instance of violence in response is quickly shown to be futile, and the characters eventually triumph through their own skills, force of will, and teamwork. It is this spirit that The Savage World of My Little Pony seeks to capture, and in order to do this, an important rule has been added to the ones presented in the Savage Worlds Explorer&amp;rsquo;s Edition, called the Tenet Against Violence:&lt;br/&gt;In any game session in which one or more of the players resorted to violence, whether it is physical violence or other actions intended to cause deliberate physical or mental harm to themselves or others, all players receive no experience points for that session. This is ultimately up to the Game Master&amp;rsquo;s discretion, but it is intended to punish players who violate the spirit of the show and of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In place of the normal combat system featured in Savage Worlds, this module presents an alternate re-flavoring of the mechanics of combat in order to stay true to the show. These alternate rules allow for the same fast-paced action present in Savage Worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
