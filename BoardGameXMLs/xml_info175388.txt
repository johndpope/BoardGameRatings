			<description>Learn the colors and match them with pictures. Three learning games in one box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variant 1:&lt;br/&gt;Three cards make a set. These sets are marked with a little animal (a bug). If you place cards of one set side by side, the bugs match each other, when placed correct. &lt;br/&gt;Shuffle all 36 cards and place them faceup on the table. On your turn, throw the die. On 2, 4 or 6 take any one card from the table and place it front of yourself. On 1, 3 or 5 pass the turn to the next player. Try to collect all three cards of a set. No one may take a card belonging to a set started by another player. You may start a new set only after you finished a set. The game ends when all cards are collected. The player with the most cards in front of him wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variant 2:&lt;br/&gt;Memory - play with the 24 picture cards or with all 36 cards. If played with 36 cards, always turn up three cards and try to find the matching triplets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variant 3:&lt;br/&gt;I spy with my litte eye something ... Use the color cards to determine the color to spy and use the chips as victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
