			<description>Saxtorpsloppet (&amp;quot;The Saxtorp Race&amp;quot;) is a motorcycle racing and betting game from Swedish publisher Alga. It is one of Alga's first games ever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has an unusual mechanic since one person handles all six motorcycles and an infinite number of participants can take part and place bets. (It is also possible to be only sex players, each with one motorcycle and in that case it is a normal racing game.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of six small wooden motorcycles (with drivers), each mounted on a small sheet of carton, some playing card-size pieces to lay out as the track, and the rules. The track pieces have numbers on both sides, 1 to 6 in different random orders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing the track pieces is laid out in a straight fashion in a random order (which makes the number of possible tracks very high) and one playing piece (motorcycle) is choosen to start. That piece will, when placed on the side of the first track piece, point towards one of the sex numbers (digits) and that motorcycle is then moved along the first. Now the second motorcycle will point towards a number, and so a third motorcycle is moved forward (pointing to a number). And so it goes on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually one of the already moved motorcycles will be moved a track piece ahead and point to another number on that track piece. In a few moves' time all six motorcycles will be engaged in the race, &amp;quot;promoting&amp;quot; another (or ocassionally itself) to further pieces on the track. Winner is the playing piece (motorcycle) that reaches the last track piece first. The track pieces are double-sided so the race takes place along 24 track sections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
