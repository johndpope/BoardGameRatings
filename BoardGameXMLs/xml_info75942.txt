							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Changeling Cantrip Cards</name>
									
			<description>User Summary: Crreated by White Wolf in an effort to combine the CCG market of the mid-1990's with their role-playing lines. These cards were a game accessory used to randomize the use of powers and abilities in Changeling: the Dreaming. Each had an illustration on one side and rules explanations and mechanics on the reverse. The product did not sell well as players disliked the collectible aspect of what should have been a useful game tool and accessory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Packs were sold at $2.50 each for a random set of 10 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Blurb: These oversized cards bring together over 160 original, full-color pieces of art from Changeling. Changeling magic is wild and Capricious; one never knows what to expect from it. These amazing illustrated cards provide a wonderful game aid to bring your character's cantrips to life. These fantastic art cards are also game accessories that simulate the wild flow of faerie magic. While not necessary for game play (rules for making your own cards are available in the Changeling rulebook) all Changeling players and World of Darkness fans will want to collect and own this limited series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
