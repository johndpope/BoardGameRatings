			<description>The Blueprints product line offers you old-fashioned blue printed maps for using in your adventures and campaigns. For each map you get a blueprint version and a standard black and white version. The maps are all vector-based so you will get maximum print resolution. Despite their old fashioned appearance each map offers you a degree of customization, using the pdf technology at its best. A button (which will not be printed) on each map allows you to turn on and off the grid, eliminate the room numbers, get the walls filled, don&amp;rsquo;t show doors and furniture and many other options, depending on the kind of map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each product features a classic fantasy adventure location: a dungeon, a keep, a temple complex, a thieves guild and so on. You can use these map as reference to build your own adventures or simply take them at hand in case your players go in an unexpected direction during the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Kobolds Warrens&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the kobolds warrens.&lt;br/&gt;This blueprint offers five fantasy locations that may house our little dirty friends: the kobolds.

But the dead do not like this invasion...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ruined Keep&lt;br/&gt;The ruined keep has been home of various monsters in the past. While in the outside ruins wandering monster dwell for a while, kobolds dug deep in the backside mountain and established their warren there. The dirty little monsters use a secret passage to sneak outside during the night and steal goodies from adventurers...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abandoned Tower&lt;br/&gt;A band of kobolds bandits have claimed this ruined tower as their hideout. The leaders of the kobolds are a sly shaman and a mighty warrior. The kobold brothers maraud the wagons of poor villagers in the vale below. The villagers are tired of this band of kobolds but do not dare to venture in the tower because they think it is haunted...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dwarven Burial Chamber&lt;br/&gt;The dwarven burial chamber remained untouched for centuries because two mighty stone golems guarded its entrance. Recently an evil wizard got the control of the stone golems and took them away for his own purposes. The curious kobolds entered the burial chamber and desecrated the old resting place... &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
