			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This latest product in the new Ship Plans range for the B5 universe is a complete tour of one of the Narn Regime's finest warships: The magnificent G'Quan-class heavy cruiser, in all its glory. The G'Quan forms the core of any Narn attack fleet. With the development of the G'Quan, the Narn finally threw off their dependence upon old Centauri technology and implemented revolutionary design features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;G'Quan Ship Plans takes you through every aspect of this workhorse of the Narn Regime fleet - every bulkhead, generator, capability and design flaw. Painstakingly researched from both the B6 canon universe and real-life naval and space vessels, every deck on the ship has a full, detailed and to-scale schematic, along with accompanying descriptions and explanations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment&lt;br/&gt;the print edition contains a booklet, a folded map of the deck plans and a cardboard &amp;quot;screen&amp;quot; with a map of the ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
