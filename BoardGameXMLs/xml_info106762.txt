			<description>King Arthur II takes the player back to Britannia, not too long after Arthur and his knights defeated their enemies, vowing to turn their lands into a brighter place for all. Alas, things did not work out that way. Arthur suffers from a magical wound which the best healers and magicians have been unable to heal. The Holy Grail is missing and the Knights of the Round Table have disbanded. Some fled, some are rebelling and to make matters even worse, a monstrous race, the strength of which was hinted at in the first game, has emerged. The Formorians are demonic creatures that usually come in the &amp;ldquo;big and scary&amp;rdquo; variety and they have their own agenda for Britannia and Arthur. &lt;br/&gt;The player is tasked with creating a new army, one with even stronger knights and with a whole range of new units available to recruit. The most formidable of which are the dragons: hard to kill due to their thick skin and leathery wings and fearsome as they breathe fire and destruction over their targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though the overall concept of King Arthur remains unchanged, Neocore has crammed a ton of changes and a number of innovations into this sequel. You still cruise the map with your knightly heroes and command forces that seem to have stepped right out of a dark fantasy novel. And like before, your actions determine whether you will go down in history as a saint or a tyrant through the game&amp;rsquo;s deep morality system. At the heart of this system are the quests which come available through diplomacy, adventuring or battle. The more extreme you are in your choice between good or evil, the higher will be the rewards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;King Arthur II is a role-playing wargame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
