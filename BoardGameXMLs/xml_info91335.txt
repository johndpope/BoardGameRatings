			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player is on his way to Paris and must cross an unknown city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts at the south entrance of a randomly-generated city. The player must travel across the town and reach the only available exit, to the north. Along the way, a lot of hazards await him, from overzealous police officers who will fine the player for the smallest infraction to engine failures, punctured tires and muggers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a wireframe 3D display of the current position of the player in the town. Several indicators show the current fuel level, available cash money (needed to repair the car or pay fines) and a compass. The player must monitor these indicators, time his passage at some intersections to avoid traffic lights and use the few shops and banks he may encounter to refill his gas tank, buy a spare tire or withdraw more cash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Version notes:&lt;br/&gt;The game was first published as a BASIC program by Morad Hamdi in the French videogame magazine Hebdogiciel. It was then reworked by Michel Fernandez and published by Cobra Soft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
