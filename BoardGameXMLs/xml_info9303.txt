							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Intrepid Journey: Game 1 â€“ Survival in the 20th Century</name>
									
			<description>This is a game designed to ensure that players have knowledge about the facts necessary for survival in the 20th century. Questions are very technical, such as &amp;quot;Is a BC dry chemical extinguisher effective on a Class A Fire&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;People may be asphyxiated by volcanic ash (T/F)?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play works by rolling a dice and moving around a circular track, asking questions at particular points, with correct answers moving you forward. One must also gather supply points, which can supplement the roll of the die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game appears to be out of print, and I cannot find any web references. The rule/question book is 100 pages long. I can take a digital photo of the game if you wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
