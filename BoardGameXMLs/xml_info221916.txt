			<description>Stalin Subway (Russian title &amp;quot;Метро-2&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Metro-2&amp;quot;) is a Russian first-person shooter video game based in a fictionalized post-war Soviet Moscow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was developed by G5 software and Orion games. It was published in Russia by Buka Entertainment in September 2005 and the United States in October of that year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before E3 2005 the developers gave GameSpot a preview of the game. GameSpot noted that its &amp;quot;combination [of] historical fiction plotline and modern FPS gameplay sets it apart from the typical sci-fi or military shooters that dominate the market today&amp;quot; and showed interest in way the physics engine allowed &amp;quot;different bullet penetration abilities for each weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in 1952 in Moscow in the Soviet Union, under Joseph Stalin who has been in power for over 30 years. The game focuses on a fictional internal plot against Stalin and the Soviet government. Locations include the Metro subway stations including the secret Metro-2 line, the KGB Lubyanka Building, the Kremlin, Moscow State University and Stalin's bunker. The game is notable, alongside You Are Empty (2006) and the games in the Metro 2033 series, for being one the few games to be set in and around the Moscow Metro system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot&lt;br/&gt;In this game you play as the soldier Gleb Suvorov, a member of the KGB out of his depth and the mysterious GRU officer Natalia Mihaleva. Suvorov discovers that high-ranking officers want to detonate a secret nuclear weapon sent via D-6 during the Bolshevik Assembly. He rescues his father from the KGB prison, thwarts the plot and saves Stalin, the ruling Communist Party and many innocent civilians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stalin_Subway The Stalin Subway]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
