							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">All That Glitters...</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The dark jungle trees loom above you and the scent of tropical blooms hangs heavy on the windless air. Overhead, brightly coloured birds wheel and dip through the branches. Swarming mosquitoes buzz angrily as you raise a waterskin to your lips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Still you push on, carefully following the riverbank and the fragment of your map. Those scraps of parchment came from this jungle - of that you are sure - the carving they had been carelessly wrapped around were the work of the local natives. Now you have left those peaceful craftsmen far behind and the map has led you to the uncharted territory of the murderous Atem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ahead the river breaks into white water. These must be the rapids marked on the map. Reaching into your pouch, you draw out the fragments of the parchment, and once again you mind drifts ahead to your ultimate goal - the treasures promised at the journey's end. Riches! And hopefully an end to this stifling, humid jungle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you unravel the map's mysteries and find your way to the promised treasure? Or will your dreams end only in death and an unmarked grave far from home!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only the bravest characters of levels 5-7 will live to discover that all that glitters is not gold, but much, much more!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
