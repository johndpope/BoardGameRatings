			<description>This is a sheaf of paper containing these items:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Second World War&lt;br/&gt;This uses modified Confrontation rules for a 5-player WWII game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Milopoliks&lt;br/&gt;A multi-player 19th century military-political game.  This uses the Confrontation maps and land counters but includes a new set of rules and six sheets of cards and counters to cut out (the latter are supposed to be glued to the back of the Confrontation counters).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chief of State&lt;br/&gt;A large multi-player game (up to 12 people, in theory) in which each player controls a nation's allocation of resources to industry, agricultural production, technology, etc., in an effort to improve its situation more than any other nation's (on a percentage basis).  Conflict is heavily abstracted.  This game uses the Confrontation maps, but has new rules, and doesn't use anything else except the included allocation forms. This game was designed by Scott Duncan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gamescience Report&lt;br/&gt;A newsletter, probably the first (only?) issue.  It has some errata, clarifications, and optional rules for Confrontation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play-by-mail rules, plus the cold war and hot war order forms to use with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
