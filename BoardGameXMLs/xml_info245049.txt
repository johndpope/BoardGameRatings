			<description>You've been boosting cars ever since you were a little kid. It was the &amp;quot;family business,&amp;quot; so to speak. So, when you and your cronies stumble across a parking lot full of luxury, heavily modified rally cars, there is no freaking way you can pass up such a tasty cherry just waiting to be plucked. But, to steal them all, and not end up doing a nickel in the big house, you know you must be... gone in 61 seconds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How To Play&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle and arrange the &amp;quot;Car&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Security Guard&amp;quot; cards in a 4x8 grid, face up on the playing surface. This is the &amp;quot;Parking Lot.&amp;quot; Security Guards face the most expensive car between those in front of and behind it. Place the rest of the deck face down. The player to the left of the dealer has first turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each turn a player draws 1 card and replaces a card in the Parking Lot with it, keeping the card removed. &amp;quot;Forward&amp;quot; cards replace any unblocked card to steal it by driving it away in forward gear. &amp;quot;Reverse&amp;quot; cards allow the opposite action. &amp;quot;Plus&amp;quot; cards steal a car in either direction and give the player an extra turn. Blank cards cover Security Guards to remove them. If a card can't be played, place it at the bottom of the deck and skip the turn. A turn ends when the drawn card is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A car cannot be stolen if another car or Security Guard is blocking the path out of the lot, or if the guard's flashlight is pointed directly at it. The game ends when all cards have been stolen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who has stolen the greatest value of cars after all have been boosted, wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
