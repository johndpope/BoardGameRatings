							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Giant&#039;s Rapture (C&amp;C)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Type: Overland, Dungeon&lt;br/&gt;Level: 5-8 listed on back (6 - 8 Listed on title page)&lt;br/&gt;Party: 4 to 8 characters (listed on title page)&lt;br/&gt;Setting: Portable to Home-brew&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eurich Gunshoff IV, Count of Kleaves, is beset by powerful enemies. The King to the north has laid waste his holdings beyond the Tot River and even now threatens the river castles. Only the coming winter holds him at bay, giving the Count time, if only a little, to muster his strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long have the people of Kleaves worshiped the gods of the south, and it is to these people that he turns, striking a bargain with the powerful King of Kaymor. In exchange for a precious gift the Kayomarese promise to aid Eurich and his people, but it is Eurich's charge to deliver the prize. He can spare few troops, and with spies all about he cannot be too careful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prize he sets in a wagon in a caravan, and as escort he calls upon those who dwell upon the fringes of society, adventurers who seek fame, gold and glory. They are charged to cross the wilderness and deliver the wagons safely. But the road is fraught with danger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Walls of stone block the road and winter upon the open plains carries dangers beyond the biting cold. But more than stone and frost, the end promises fire without comfort. Designed in 3 parts, Giant's Rapture offers overland travel, dungeon, and intrigue and pits the character's wits against the open road and one another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed as a Tourney Adventure Giant's Rapture contains three adventures: A Stone's Wager, Winter's Promise, and Trial by Fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
