			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Going Concern is a supplement that expands on the rules for running a business given in the Dungeon Master's Guide. Within you'll find options for different business types and cultures, random events that impact businesses, and management actions player character business owners can use to enhance their profits. Other topics include debt and interest, merits of purchasing an existing business versus building your own, adventure hooks to tie business ownership to the greater campaign, and a new background that allows a new character to start off with a small business of his or her own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
