							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NHL 2K11</name>
									
			<description>NHL 2K11 marks 2K Sports&amp;rsquo; third ground-breaking hockey release on Wii.  Taking video game hockey to a new level, improved Wii MotionPlus control brings revolutionary puck skills to your Wii Remote with the ability to execute real-time (one-to-one) dekes, puck juggling, shooting and defensive maneuvers.  Bringing these incredible moves to life are improved player models, freshly lit and redesigned arenas, and highly detailed jerseys and equipment. Completing the package and making this the deepest hockey experience available on Wii, 2K Sports introduces the all-new Road to the Cup mode featuring Mii characters battling in mini-games, trivia challenges and skills competitions.  With even more authentic hockey action than before including broken sticks, more responsive skating and improved A.I., NHL 2K11 is sure to score big with Wii gamers this season!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The iPhone version is a slimmed down version of the game, with simplified controls and fewer maneuvers and game modes. Much of the heart of the game is maintained by the release, however.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
