							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Second Boer War</name>
									
			<description>Boer War is an operational level simulation of the Second Boer War(1899-1902), fought between the forces of the British Empire and the Boer republics of South Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game map portrays southern Africa as it was at the end of the Nineteenth Century. Counters represent the military forces that took part in the conflict, including headquarters, logistics as well as combat units. Relatively low unit density requires a key-point defense strategy for both sides and protection of supply lines which the Boers were initially able to raid with impunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenarios, Design Notes, Experimental Rules and Errata were printed in issue 214.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
