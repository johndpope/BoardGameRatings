							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lair of the Stitch Witch</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lair of the Stitch Witch is an introductory adventure for use with any 5e Compatible Fantasy setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this adventure, the characters encounter a portal to another, darker world. The Necrobyss is a horrific land suspended in the deepest regions of space, far from the more civilized worlds of the multiverse.  Connected to various planes and numerous worlds through portals known as the Eyes of Ocassus, the Necrobyss is a land forged from the crushed head of a long-dead titan. In the Necrobyss, the land itself is formed from the bone of this once undead monstrosity. Rivers made of the titan&amp;rsquo;s blood flow across the land, and those beings native to this terrible place have learned to survive in such a horrific landscape through foul magic, unparalleled cunning, and brutal tribalism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lair of the Stitch Witch brings the characters to one of these Eyes of Ocassus, and through it, into an initial encounter with the world of the Necrobyss. The initial encounter with the Eye of Ocassus is created to be able to be dropped into virtually any fantasy setting, permitting the GM to drop this adventure into any existing campaign, or to use it as a launch point for a new campaign. Should the characters survive, they will discover the existence of the Necrobyss, and the abhorrent beings who call this strange world home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lair of the Stitch Witch offers:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    An introduction to a new, original dark fantasy setting&lt;br/&gt;    Ten new monsters&lt;br/&gt;    Two new locations&lt;br/&gt;    Two new magic items&lt;br/&gt;    A gruesome, gore-packed adventure for players of 1st - 3rd level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
