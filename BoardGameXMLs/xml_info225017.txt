			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Can't Go Home Again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether your players are solving the mystery of vanished village residents, searching for clues to a generations-old crime, or driving out invaders so settlers can return, impatient visitors don't want to wait for a Game Master to draw every hole in the roof. This Pathfinder Map Pack provides beautifully illustrated 5&amp;quot; &amp;times; 8&amp;quot; map tiles that can be used to construct a variety of village ruins. Inside, you'll find 18 richly crafted map tiles, with features like:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Abandoned Fountain&lt;br/&gt;- Broken Bridge&lt;br/&gt;- Moldering House&lt;br/&gt;- Rotting Granary&lt;br/&gt;- Scorched Room&lt;br/&gt;- Weedy Graveyard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters shouldn't waste their time sketching maps whenever characters decide to visit an abandoned hamlet. With Pathfinder Map Pack: Ruined Village, you'll always be ready to take your players into the too-quiet walls of former residences&amp;mdash;and face the horrors within!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
