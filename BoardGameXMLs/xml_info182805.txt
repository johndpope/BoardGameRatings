							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Missing Mythic Magic Volume XVII</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uncover Forgotten Arcane Lore!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone knows that knowledge is power, and that having options is better than not having them. It should come as no surprise, then, that wizards, witches, and other powerful spellcasters are always on the lookout for new and exciting spells to add to their repertoires. While many spells from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook received a facelift and an upgrade in Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Mythic Adventures, the sourcebook that introduced mythic power to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, dozens of spells were left behind. Missing Mythic Magic Volume XVII, and its predecessors, aim to give each and every spell from the core rules a full-fledged mythic upgrade, all the way from A to Z, with a special focus on making mythic spells that feel as over-the-top and larger-than-life as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This installment includes 20 mythic spells, from remove disease to scrying, greater. A mythic repel metal or stone can affect objects of much greater size, and grants much greater control over how they are repelled, including allowing you to make ranged attacks with them. A mythic resilient sphere can be created so that it is not anchored in place, allowing you to roll it about freely, and is much more resistant to damage. A mythic resurrection can not only bring back outsiders, constructs, and undead, it can even bring back those whose souls are unwilling or imprisoned, and a mythic rusting grasp can affect a much wider array of objects, and can even take the form of a 60-ft.-radius burst. This tome contains all that, and much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
