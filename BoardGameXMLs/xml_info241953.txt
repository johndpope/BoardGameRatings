			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Holiday One-Shot Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compatible with Most Fantasy RPG systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recommended for 4-6 player characters of levels 2 to 4&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Children have gone missing from a quiet Elven village!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have been chosen to seek out the culprit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you save the children and bring the fiend to justice?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hello and welcome, adventurers and Game Masters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this adventure your players are asked to help an ancient elven community hidden in the mountains above a nation of humans. The adventure begins when the players stumble upon a magical portal to the elven village late one evening. Although the elven Yuletide festivities are at hand, sadness grips their kingdom. Someone broke through their formidable mystic defenses, entered the valley and absconded with several elven children. The culprit is described as looking like a large satyr, with the upper body of a human and the lower body of a faun. Its rough skin and coarse fur are a purplish black. The large ram&amp;rsquo;s horns on its head and its hooves are a deep black. It wears a chain with bells around its waist and a woven basket on its back. It is a demonic being known as Krampus, and each Yuletide it comes to the Prime Material Plane in search of naughty children to punish! As if that were not bad enough, Krampus is served by vile-hearted dark elves!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The thieving beast also stole the elves&amp;rsquo; sacred gem; its name translates roughly to Alfspark in the local human&amp;rsquo;s tongue. This is a large seed, the size of a man&amp;rsquo;s head, which is infused with the mystical power of the elven gods, which the elven seers use to keep their valley hidden and in an eternal spring-like state. Without it the portal to their valley is stuck open, the elves are unprotected, and unless it is recovered their valley will return, dramatically, to freezing conditions. It will mean the destruction of their community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your players are asked to find and return the captive children, defeat the evil fiends who took them, and find the Alfspark; all before the sun rises and the hidden elven village is exposed to the outside world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains a completely original Holiday ONE SHOT adventure, fully detailed and ready for immediate use with very little preparation by the GM or the players! Inside you will find great Old-school art and maps, with detailed encounters for each area. This module also includes a fully detailed map of the nation of Alderburgh, done in the Old School style, with information for further exploration. A quick night of Yuletide role-playing fun right at your fingertips!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module provides wonderful background information and additional areas for adventure for those GM&amp;rsquo;s setting their campaigns in the author&amp;rsquo;s ever expanding campaign world, which now comprises four different kingdoms: Jarlburgh, Alderburgh, The Red Eagle Barony, and D&amp;uacute;n Loachas. This adventure takes place along the eastern edge of the Alderburgh valley, the location of the Starry Knight Press modules S1 The Harquebusier, SK2 Scoundrelâ€™s Run, and SCh1 The Purloined Pachyderm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book features 16 pages of excitement and thrills, with players facing a mythic holiday foe, and it is sure to please discerning GMs and players everywhere!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
