							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">3D Pawn</name>
									
			<description>3D Pawn is like a simple 3 dimensional chess, played around a 3 by 3 square cube just using pawns.&lt;br/&gt; Players take turns (starting with white) to move a piece. Pawns can be moved forward and sideways but not backward. Pawns can also take diagonally. If a pawn is on its starting side, it can be moved twice in the same direction.&lt;br/&gt;Goal: players aim to win by getting one of their pawns onto their oponent's side without being immediately taken.&lt;br/&gt;The bag contains a wooden cube to play around, and 9 magnetic pieces of each colour, which stick to the cube. An instruction sheet is also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
