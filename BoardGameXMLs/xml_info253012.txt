			<description>Publisher Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fast Fun Card game, designed by David Harmer (author of Aftermath! Technology!, Aftermath! Magic!, and Aftermath! Survival Guide). This single-deck card game is a quick to learn game for 2-6 players. Only 5 minutes to learn, but can be played for hours. Many of the cards change the game rules, but the details are printed on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This card game was sold online through the Fantasy Games Unlimited Website. The shrinkwrapped deck of cards had card backs marked &amp;quot;FH&amp;quot; and included the first expansion which adds new cards to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
