			<description>Hundreds of years from now, the greatest sport the galaxy has ever known will explode on your screens as everyone watches their favorite teams of giant Mechs beating each other to scrap. Mechadrome is a &amp;quot;Mech Combat Gladiator Arena Skirmish Game&amp;quot; set in the far future where man and alien races have come together, forming teams that do battle in arenas set in abandoned, war-torn cities and industrial zones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are simple, fast &amp;amp; fun and you may build your Mechs with a wide variety of devastating weapons, or use our own pre-made teams like the Terran Titans or Team Bushido. The game features a variety of scenarios such as Capture the Flag or No Mech's Land, the objective will always be different, so no game will ever be the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechadrome Mech models are available in 28mm scale, and made from traditional resin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
