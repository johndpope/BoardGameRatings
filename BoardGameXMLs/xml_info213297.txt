			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expat Life is a phrase-matching game designed around the unique lifestyle of global nomads. Expat Life is perfect for expats, diplomats, military, third culture kids, and social gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of question cards and answer cards. Each round, a judge puts a question card into play. All other players select the best answer from their hand and pass it to the judge. The judge picks a winner for that round, and the judging duty rotates to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expat Life features easy rules and quick set up so you don&amp;rsquo;t waste time. It&amp;rsquo;s a compact card game, so you can throw it in your bag and bring it to a friend&amp;rsquo;s house. The endless combinations of questions and answers will have you laughing right away. The familiar scenarios will have you swapping stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
