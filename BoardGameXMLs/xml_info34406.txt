			<description>Battlefinder! is a campaign generation supplement for use with the various miniatures rules released by The Perfect Captain. It is  also suitable for use as a campaign generator for other gaming systems set in Western Europe, for the period 1000 to 1700 A.D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It is in essence a modular campaign board that can be used in thousands of configurations. You can use this in conjunction with our miniature rules sets (Ironbow, Spanish Fury, Actions! and Spanish Fury, Battle! or Pistolado!) or with any other set you might own (for those of you who dare to touch a non-Perfect Captain product&amp;hellip;you know who you are!). This set can be used in a variety of ways, some of which I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ll develop yourselves - and if you do develop something, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to write it up for our Yahoo group, and share it with us all.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The cards included with this campaign generator can be used to simulate most areas of Western Europe from the Pyrenees to the edge of the Eurasian Steppes, and from the Alps to Scandanavia.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Battlefinder! components include a rulebook, a mapsheet, terrain cards and a set of counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all games from The Perfect Captain, Battlefinder is available for free download to print and play. (See Web Links.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
