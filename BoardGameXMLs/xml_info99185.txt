			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the western seaboard of far distant Verdan, the human city of Balphor has been set upon by the armies of the Autumn Queen. Ill equipped to deal with such a threat, the men of Balphor have barred the gates to their great city, sealing themselves off from the world that exists outside. As the elves lay siege to the city, its residents do the only thing that they can do. They wait for death to claim them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;vs. Elves takes place within the walls of Balphor, on the western seaboard of Verdan, at the close of the 7th Aeon. Players assume the roles of human settlers, besieged by the armies of the Autumn Queen, the cruel ruler of Verdan in the wake of King Oberon&amp;rsquo;s assassination. The Autumn Queen will not rest until her lands are purged of human taint. She will not rest until you are dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to play vs. Elves, you will need a copy of this document, a standard deck of playing cards, and a copy of the vsM Engine (which is made freely available by the cunning and devious Philip Reed).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
