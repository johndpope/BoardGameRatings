			<description>The Space Sheriff Spirits (宇宙刑事魂 Uchū Keiji Tamashii, lit. &amp;quot;Space Detective Spirit&amp;quot;), is an action game for the PlayStation 2. This game is based on the popular Japanese live-action TV series Space Sheriff trilogy produced by the famous Toei Company. The three seasons were directed by Hattori Kazuyasu and Yoshiaki Kobayashi, and were named Space Sheriff Gavan (宇宙刑事ギャバン Uchū Keiji Gyaban, 1982-83), Space Sheriff Sharivan (宇宙刑事シャリバン Uchū Keiji Shariban, 1983-84) and Space Sheriff Shaider (宇宙刑事シャイダー Uchū Keiji Shaidā, 1984-85). This series helped the Metal Heroes genre to grow popular in Japan in the '80s. The Space Sheriff trilogy was quickly exported in European countries, such as France since 1982 (the series was renamed X-OR), Asia (including Indonesia, Malaysia and most notably Philippines) and Latin America (Brazil). The game was simultaneously released on May 25, 2006 in Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Weekly Famitsu rated it 21/40.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kenji Ohba and Hiroshi Watari reprised their roles as Gavan and Sharivan, respectively. Takuo Kawamura took over as the voice of Shaider, as Hiroshi Tsuburaya died in 2001.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Space Sheriff Spirits&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
