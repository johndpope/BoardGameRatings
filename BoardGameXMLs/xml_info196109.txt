			<description>You are Shinkai, gifted with the ability to control the five Mystic Forces with which you can learn the art of conjuring to do battle with your enemies. Learn the art of enchanting and harness the powers of the Mystic Forces to create your own magical items, or transform yourself into a Dragonknight; a powerful dragon-like creature capable of flying and performing lethal breath attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is now the year 600 AA, and with the growing threat of the Corruption, the race to reactivate the once-mighty spires, which have the ability to heal the land, is in full flight. Kings of all lands are pouring their resources into the restoration of the Defenders and the fight against the Corruption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many fear the fate of all of Oryathar is set on a path of annihilation, and that the mounting hordes of corrupted creatures are an unstoppable foe. But with the rebirth of the Shinkai, events are bound to change. The land may yet fall to the Corruption, but not without a fight. Not as long as you, Shinkai, still retain hope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have been born to reclaim the lands from the grip of the Corruption, and see the Defenders restored to their former glory. You have the ability to stand against the darkness that threatens all! But beware, for the influence of the Corruption is great, and you too could fall prey to its evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play one of seven unique races and join the battle to save Oryathar. All characters have equal access to the multiple forms of magic, and may learn Talents from up to three separate Specialties, as well as a host of Skills and Universal Talents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No waiting for Level Ups!&lt;br/&gt;Character progression is constant, with that next must-have ability or power just around the corner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All rules needed to play Mystic Forces, including a full Creature Lore and Game Master Section, are included in this rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experience the intense, mystical world of Oryathar in this exciting fantasy roleplaying game from Noble Quests!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Source: From the back of the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
