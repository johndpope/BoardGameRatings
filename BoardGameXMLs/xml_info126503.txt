			<description>You could, if you were so inclined, call The Sea Will Claim Everything an adventure game with an emphasis on characters and storytelling. You could say its gameplay is more about exploration and details than it is about obscure puzzles. You could say it defies categorization and revels in simply being what it wants to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You could, but you&amp;rsquo;d be wrong, because what it really is is a portal to the Lands of Dream. More specifically, it&amp;rsquo;s a portal to the Fortunate Isles, where the sinister Lord Urizen is using the debt crisis to impose his will on the people, and where the ancient biotechnological dwelling called Underhome is facing foreclosure. Your help is needed. Are you ready for a journey?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
