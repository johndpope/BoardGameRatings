			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Confederation Wars the Madeiran Union was one of the fiercest and most mysterious sides of the conflict.  Striking from uncharted space at random vectors the Madeirans never seemed to be at a loss for ships, supplies, or men.  Even now nearly thirty years after the founding of the Confederation the Madeiran Union is still talked about with an air once reserved for urban legends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the wreckage of the MMS Yu-Ti on a desolate, un-named ice world. The CMSC has discovered the existence of a Madeiran Ghost Fleet deep in the Levigos Nebula near the center of the Rim and behind the lines of Bug space.   Believing that the fleet lay as salvage the CMSC dispatches the Sword of Hathor to survey the Ghost Fleet in hopes that the vessels could help replenish the losses sustained in the war against the Bugs &amp;hellip; the problem is this is a Ghost Fleet in more than just name &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
