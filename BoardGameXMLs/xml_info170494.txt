			<description>From the back of the box (translated from German):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick Step is a smart amusement game full of surprises for 2 or 4 people. Luck is not determining because it depends very much on where to best move your stone. Each game of QUICK STEP is exciting and full of new contingencies to which you must respond tactically smart and clever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick Step is, as the name implies, a fast, quick lively game that invites to play several games in a row to determine the overall winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup Quick Step:&lt;br/&gt;With 2 players, each player gets four double-sided pieces (green/red) and builds a tower with it. One player puts all the green sides face up and the other player puts all the red sides up. The towers are then placed in the big starting circle marked with red and green. &lt;br/&gt;With 4 players, the blue/yellow pieces are used also. Setup is the same, but blue and yellow start at the other big circle, playing then in the other direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing Quick Step:&lt;br/&gt;Roll the Dice. Move one piece that shows your color. If you land on an empty space, turn your piece face down (now the color of your opponent is visible!). If you land on any other piece(s), don't turn your pice face down. All pieces under your piece are now blocked and cannot move until you move your piece away. If you roll a &amp;quot;6&amp;quot;, don't turn your piece face dawn, even if you land on an empty space.&lt;br/&gt;It may happen that your color is not visible when it is your turn. Then you just skip your turn. The situation on the board may change and then you can play again.&lt;br/&gt;To reach the end of the track, you have to roll exactly the needed number and you don't turn your piece face down then.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the person who moves one piece directly into the ending circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
