			<description>The guests are read a short story with blanks at certain points. The game is for the guests to fit in the correct words during the evening. The most right answers, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box also contains two more modest party games. Public Notices asks all participating guests to fill in the gaps on well known notices. And Change a Letter tests their knowledge of animals. Each player is given a list of words and they have to change just one letter to make it the name of an animal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
