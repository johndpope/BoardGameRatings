			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GoldenEye 007, based off of the 1995 Bond film, was highly successful and much praised.  The single-player campaign mode does a good job of capturing some of the locations and confrontations featured in the the film, and admirably mixes shooting and stealth elements that keep you on edge the whole time.  &lt;br/&gt;However, even with how good the single-player mode is, it is the multiplayer mode of GoldenEye 007 that pushed it over the top into becoming an all-time favorite.  With various weapon sets, tons of characters to choose from, deathmatch mode, licensed to kill, slappers only, and many others, you'll keep coming back for just one more match!&lt;br/&gt;Perfect Dark was released as the &amp;quot;spiritual successor&amp;quot; to GoldenEye 007 and has improved upon the high bar that GoldenEye 007 set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GoldenEye 007 was released for the N64 in 1997.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
