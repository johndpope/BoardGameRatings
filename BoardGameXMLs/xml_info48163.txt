							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Railway Rivals Map A: South Wales Coalfield (East)</name>
									
			<description>A map for use with the Railway Rivals game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map covers the Eastern portion of the South Wales Coalfield, a particularly hilly area referred to in the UK as 'the valleys'. It was rich in coal, and much of the rail traffic was coal being sent to ports for export. In consequence, the map has 'special runs' - so on alternate runs, one end of the run is a special destination such as any or specific ports, or to edge towns for connection to England.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hilly terrain means that this is not a good map for beginners. Playing with the 'leapfrog' variant can mitigate some of these issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
