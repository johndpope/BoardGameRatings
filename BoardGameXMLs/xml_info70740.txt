			<description>TactDecks - A portable, expandable, easy to learn tactical combat game combining the best elements of card games and miniature-based wargames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build a heroic, customized fantasy party out of the included 10 Character cards, or feed your creativity by supplementing with the Series 1 TactDecks Boosters. All Characters have different sets of statistics and powers - find your own unique combination and lay waste to your opponent!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TactDecks is a two-player competitive game where the objective is to eliminate your opponent through a tactical combination of spells, troop movement, and light board manipulation. All components of the game - board, troops, terrain, mechanics - are represented by pocket-sized cards, making TactDecks highly portable and affordable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like many traditional miniature based wargames, TactDecks troops are selected based on a total army point value agreed upon prior to the start of the game. In addition to selecting troops, terrain is also chosen from this common point pool. Initial troop selection and terrain placement is considered a tactical component of the game, since some troops may not be fielded by both players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat mechanics are based on Near (adjacent) and Far (ranged) attacks, modified by individual troop prowess. Degrees of attack success are determined by an &amp;quot;event deck.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to physical attacks, TactDecks also features varying spell mechanics, trap placement (with expansion booster cards), and a light melee dueling system incorporating a feature called &amp;quot;Reserves,&amp;quot; which also help determine initiative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TactDecks is easy to learn and scales in complexity based on whatever additional booster sets the players bring to the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A single TactDecks Basic Set may be used as a competitive starter deck or split and used by two players with the included optional rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
