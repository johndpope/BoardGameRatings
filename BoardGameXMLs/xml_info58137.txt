							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jedi&#039;s Honor</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jedi's Honor&lt;br/&gt;by Troy Denning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the Battle of Yavin, the Alliance needed a secure site to base their operations. Luke's dual mission: to search for a world the Empire has overlooked, and to observe local systems along the way.&lt;br/&gt;But in the Sil'Lume Asteroid Belt, the search takes on a personal twist - a local agitator taken prisoner by the Empire is reputed to be the son of a Jedi Knight! Should Luke pursue the rumor, or is his mission for the Alliance paramount?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luke Skywalker - Jedi-in-training, Hero of Yavin - stars in this fast-paced tale of quick wits and tough decisions. You'll choose his best options and fight his opponents.&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes logic is your best tool as you analyze the situation as Luke sees it. Sometimes you have to trust in Luke's piloting prowess. And sometimes the young Rebel's untrained ability with the Force is all that stands between him and destruction!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jedi's Honor is an 80-page solo adventure featuring:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    An interactive system that emphasizes thought-provoking decision-making.&lt;br/&gt;    Longer story segments which allow for rich detail and characterization.&lt;br/&gt;    Movie-like intensity and focus.&lt;br/&gt;    A hidden game system that does what no other solitaire adventure can - it puts you so completely in the hero's world, thoughts, and feelings that you can almost hear the roar of Luke's X-wing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a novel - but you decide the course of the story!&lt;br/&gt;It's a game - but you interact with every twist to determine what happens!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
