			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evil Morvelinh has decided to enslave the gnomes of the kingdom of F&amp;eacute;erie. Two young gnomes, Wlamir the wizard and Olaf the warrior escape captivity and decide to fight back, free F&amp;eacute;erie and destroy Morvelinh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stryfe is a top-down action game for one or two players in coop mode. The goal of each level (called chapter) is to find the Silver key, which allows to pick up the Golden key, which itself is used to open the Gates of Invisibility and go to the next chapter. The game is heavily inspired by Gauntlet: both characters have different strength and weaknesses, players can pick up bottles of potion which can be used to destroy monster generators, chests to gain points and food to gain hit points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was developed by Emmanuel Zerbib, with graphics by Orou Mama.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
