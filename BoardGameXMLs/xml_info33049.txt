			<description>A path movement game based on the Boer War.  Players move down the path on the way to becoming the Commander of Chief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An early and simple game based on a military subject with a detailed and colorful map.  Key landing spots include an Ambuscade and Victoria Cross.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Called to Arms' was a game that took players along a perilous route through battles and adventures during the Boer War. It was a simple game of chance rather than military strategy that clearly took the side of the British imperial forces against the Boers. As such there was an attempt to both excite players and instill with patriotic feelings. In this respect the game is material evidence of the relationship between popular culture and ideology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under Creative Commons License: Attribution Non-Commercial&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
