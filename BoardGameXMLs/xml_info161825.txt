			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;original quote from the developer's website: Farming Simulator 14 invites you into the challenging world of a modern day farmer. Take on all the challenges of farming life, including animal husbandry (cows), crops, sales ... it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to manage and grow your own farm in an open world. As your career progresses, you will have access to a huge selection of farming vehicles and machines, faithfully recreated from the biggest names in the industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After Farming Simulator 2013 a new game was released. Farming Simulator 14 is basically a limited and easier version of FS'13. There are less brands of machinery available, there's a small map, which is always the same. FS'14 was released for mobiles and handhelds, focusing on a more casual gaming experience. Though for mobiles the app is quite cheap (and sometimes available for free), a lot of the better machines are only available as purchasable DownLoadable Content (DLC) through the ingame shop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Network multiplayer for mobile is supported both through Bluetooth or WiFi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
