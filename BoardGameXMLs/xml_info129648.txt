			<description>The HomeVesting playing board has two six-sided playing courses: the outer, purple &amp;ldquo;Rehabilitation&amp;rdquo; course, and the inner, orange &amp;ldquo;Selling&amp;rdquo; course. Each course represents a different stage of the investing process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outer &amp;ldquo;Rehabilitation&amp;rdquo; course is where we initially buy, carry, and fix up our properties. The game always starts on this outer course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inner &amp;ldquo;Selling&amp;rdquo; course is where we seek deals to sell our investments and cash out. Players individually move onto the inner Selling path as they complete their Rehabilitation process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary of the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players select investment properties, begin on their individual colored Start spot, and take turns moving their pawn around the outer Rehabilitation path to develop their properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually, each player will complete their Rehabilitation phase, progress to their colored Start spot on the inner Selling course, then proceed around the Selling course to seek a deal for cashing out and selling their investments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until only one player remains which has not settled all debts and cashed out of the game. All players have the option of short-selling and cashing out of the game at any time before completing their full rehabilitation and selling process, which establishes their final cash position. But a final remaining player is always forced into a short-sell to end the game. All players then evaluate their final cash position. The player finishing with the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
