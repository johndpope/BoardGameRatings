			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FIRST IMPRESSIONS is about the very people who play it.  Have you had dinner with Attila the Hun, been married to a magnifying glass or just good friends with a cactus?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;440 witty, perceptive, striking cartoons form the basis of this fast moving game where your imagination, eloquence and judgment can run wild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are played in turn and the idea is to cast your vote for the player to whom the card applies by using the voting masks with color changing eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're the one they think is like a bowl of spaghetti then you collect that card.  You could end up with a personality profile consisting of the The Leaning Tower of Pisa, Henry VIII, an octopus and a mango.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can back your judgment and argue to sway the misguided opinion of others.  Those that voted for you then move ahead in a race to the finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has two objectives:&lt;br/&gt;-  To advance your token on the board to be the first to reach the finish at the center of the board.&lt;br/&gt;-  To discover you image - the impression that you make on other people.&lt;br/&gt;Which object you place above the other depends on you and the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
