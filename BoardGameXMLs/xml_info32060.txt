							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kwest: A Game of the Sea</name>
									
			<description>Game comes like most Geographia Games with a separate board and a somewhat tiny components box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components are 50 sailing cards (45 with a single and 5 with a double sailing symbol), 5 location cards, 15 treasure cards, two cardboard ships on wooden stands, a wooden dice cup containing a special dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After setting up your starting hand (15 cards with the possibility to replace from the stockpile) you draw a location card where to dig up a pirates treasure.&lt;br/&gt;Sailing is done with the symbol cards, also depicted on the different sailing routes on the board.&lt;br/&gt;You have to fiddle out the best and farthest calculated moves with your hand, double symbol cards allowing double moves.&lt;br/&gt;In the storm reigned region in the middle of the board you have to use the special dice, depicting the standard card symbols (spade, heart, club and diamond) and 2 anchors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you reach your destination island you have to land on the shores, now rolling an anchor on the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you dare, you can try to plunder another island on your way back to homeport, but beware: Winner is the one returning home first with a treasure !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What adds additional spice is the possibility to capture the opponents ship and that the movement cards are randomly chosen after you emptied your starting hand, so no more calculating your route is possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
