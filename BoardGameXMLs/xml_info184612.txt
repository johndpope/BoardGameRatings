							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vampiric Infusions Volume I</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ancient Vampiric Secrets!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not too long ago, before there was a dhampir race, playing a vampire was a difficult and frustrating task. The vampire template was clearly not designed with player characters in mind, and couldn&amp;rsquo;t support the wide variety of interpretations of the vampire myth now available in fantasy media. Necromancers of the Northwest proposed a solution to that problem with Liber Vampyr: Secrets of the Blood, a book that presented a customizable version of a playable vampire, which not only gave you great control over your vampiric powers (in the form of vampire feats), but also gave you control over which weaknesses you possessed, as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While Liber Vampyr revolutionized the world of vampire PCs, there can never be too many options, and this book provides a small infusion of extra vampiric power to your campaign. Included are five new revenant weaknesses (allowing you to create a revenant with weaknesses taken only from this book, if you so chose), and twelve new vampire feats, which grant a variety of powers including several feats which represent the benefits of being an elder or ancient vampire, the ability to explode in a cloud of ash upon your death that infects those nearby with a disease that may turn them into revenants, a resistance to the effects of vampiric weaknesses, and the ability to share the senses of your spawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for new tricks and twists for vampires in your game, this book is for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
