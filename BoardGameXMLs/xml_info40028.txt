			<description>This is one of a series of abstract strategy games from Wales Game Systems, all branded with a Western theme after another of their games, 64-32 Ranch Roundup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description taken from inside the game's box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EQUIPMENT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Board:  The playing board consists of four home sections, each having nine numbered circles upon which are placed the nine playing pieces of one color, each piece on its own number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing Pieces:  Four sets of playing pieces are provided.  Use the cowboys numbered from 1 to 9.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play Money:  $800.00 in 64-32 Ranch Play Money is provided.  Before the game this money is divided so each player has $200.00.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is for each player to advance his cowboys around the board by moving and jumping until all of them have been returned to their respective starting positions in the home corral.  The first player to complete the moving of all his cowboys around the board wins his game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
