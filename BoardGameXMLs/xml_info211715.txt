							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battletech: Spotlight on Crescent Hawks</name>
									
			<description>For every Kell Hounds or Wolf&amp;rsquo;s Dragoons, there are a hundred similar outfits that are just as talented&amp;mdash;and just as deadly&amp;mdash;that you have never heard of. Or worse, you have not heard enough. Sure, the glory hounds who make the evening tri-vid news are movers and shakers, and can change national borders whenever they want, but they&amp;rsquo;re not the only ones. For every Eridani Light Horse brigade, there is a mercenary crew with a storied battlefield history just as spectacular. These are the unit commands that have gone largely unnoticed in the long, bloody history of the Inner Sphere, their stories untold or nearly forgotten. Take a closer look at the battles and events that have shaped the human sphere, and you&amp;rsquo;ll find even two-bit troops like Wilson&amp;rsquo;s Hussars have made a difference.&lt;br/&gt;Spotlight On: Crescent Hawks includes a Unit History, Personalities, Personnel Rosters, Mission Tracks, and data for use with all scales of BattleTech play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
