			<description>Seafari Under the Sea is a spin-and-move game where players move around a track of bubbles &amp;quot;under the sea.&amp;quot;  Each player has a puzzle picture card, and all the puzzle pieces are face-down on the table.  As they move, players land on spaces that allow them to pick one, two or three puzzle pieces.  They must take face-down pieces and try to match them to their puzzle.  If they match, the may be added to the puzzle.  If not, they are returned to the face-down pile.  Some spaces also force players to put a puzzle piece back or stay on the space until a certain number is spun.  The first player to complete his or her puzzle wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
