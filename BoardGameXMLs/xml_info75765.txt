							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heaven&#039;s Gate</name>
									
			<description>Heaven's Gate is a card game set in a far, far distant future. Colonists from Earth made inroads into other planets thousands of years ago, and now the people on those planets have all but forgotten Earth. The game takes place when the new civilizations are once again reaching their zenith and rediscovering the ability to traverse the stars. Only this time, they're not alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to either defeat your opponent by capturing (or exterminating) his planet, or by achieving transcendence on your own. This is accomplished through research, devotion, space travel, and battles both on the ground and in the skies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
