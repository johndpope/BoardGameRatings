			<description>From the Back of the Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shooting Gallery recreates a shooting range on a computer screen and includes action packed rounds. Round 1 is a version of the carnival shooting booth. Round 2 requires hitting a &amp;quot;clay pigeon&amp;quot;, a target that is tossed off into the distance that you try to hit with a shotgun (a.k.a skeet shooting). In Round 3 you must quick draw against a target and Round 4 is a repeat of Round 1 except point values have increased and the targets change direction. Round 5 requires hitting two clay pigeons with your double-barreled shotgun. In Round 6 you must quick draw against two targets. And finally, in Round 7, you are suddenly transported back into the wild west where you must finish off all the bad guys without accidentally shooting the townspeople.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
