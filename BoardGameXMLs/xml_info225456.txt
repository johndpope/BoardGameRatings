			<description>Rocket is casino style card game created by the makers of the game Pairs.  The game can be played with any Pairs playing card deck, but was specially designed and introduced with the Bar Maids deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 to 7 (including one dealer)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Need: A Pairs deck, and chips or coins for gambling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flow of Play: Rocket is structured as a casino table game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players are playing against the dealer (not each other), and the dealer plays by fixed rules.   In a home game, players should take turns being the dealer. There is a slight advantage for the dealer, so the game is only fair when the deal passes around the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Deck: You can play Rocket with a single Pairs deck, or up to 8 Pairs decks shuffled together. The deck should be reshuffled when approximately 20% remains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bet: To begin, each player must place a bet. Different players can bet different amounts. A bet must be divisible by 10 units, because all payouts will be based on 1/10 of the bet. The dealer agrees to cover bets of any size, up to a maximum bet agreed upon by all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Starting Deal: Deal one card face up to each player, and then to the dealer. Play begins on the dealer&amp;rsquo;s left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a Button: Casinos may wish to start each hand with the low card,rather than on the dealer&amp;rsquo;s left. In this case, use a button to designate the starting position, and break ties by choosing the player closest to the left of the previous button (rather than by dealing an extra card). Under these rules, the dealer still acts last.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player&amp;rsquo;s Turn: Each player is playing against the dealer only. In turn, players may either fold or hit. All players act before the dealer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Folding: When you fold (similar to surrender in blackjack), you are paying to get out of the game. Pay the dealer a fraction of your bet, which is 1/10 of the total bet multiplied by the lowest card in either your stack or the dealer&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;br/&gt; For example, if your bet is 20 coins, and the lowest card between you and the dealer is a 4, you can fold by paying 2 x 4 = 8 coins. You retrieve the remainder of your bet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hitting: When you hit, you are staying in, and trying not to get a pair. Take one card, faceup. If you don&amp;rsquo;t pair up, you are safe. If you get a pair, you lose, and must pay that number, multiplied by 1/10 of your bet. For example, if you have bet 20 coins and get a pair of 8&amp;rsquo;s, you pay 2 x 8 = 16 coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dealer&amp;rsquo;s Turn: The dealer always acts last, and plays by a diff erent set of rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dealer Must Hit: Th e dealer always hits (she cannot fold).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dealer Pair: When the dealer catches a pair, she pays all surviving players that amount, multiplied by 1/10 of their bet.&lt;br/&gt;For example, if the dealer catches 7-7, and your bet was 50, the dealer pays you 5 x 7 = 35 coins. (You also keep your bet.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death Card: A 3 is sudden death for the dealer. The dealer loses immediately if she gets a 3, even on her first card. Th is pays all bets at 3/10 (as if the dealer caught a pair of 3&amp;rsquo;s). Note: A 3 is not lethal to players, only the dealer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continuing: If the dealer doesn&amp;rsquo;t pair up or catch a 3, play resumes with the first player. The game continues until all players either catch a pair or fold, or until the dealer pairs up or catches a 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
