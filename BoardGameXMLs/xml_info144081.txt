							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quarq</name>
									
			<description>Quarq is a card game system. You can play an unlimited number of games with a Deck of Quarqs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quarq games are simple.  The rules for each fit on a single card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fundamentally, Quarq is a deck of 72 cards, consisting of&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     60 Quarq cards, each a unique &amp;quot;3-D&amp;quot; combination of 3 of the 12 suits&lt;br/&gt;     12 suit cards, which are used in some games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quarq comes packaged with 14 games, including&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     5 adaptations of top traditional card games&lt;br/&gt;     4 brand new strategy card games&lt;br/&gt;     3 novel stand-up games&lt;br/&gt;     2 poker games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...and many more Quarq games added by YOU, the community, at quarq.org.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quarq games range from &lt;br/&gt;twists on traditional games like Bridge, Hearts, Concentration, to&lt;br/&gt;radically new games that could not be played with a traditional deck of cards, like Psychics, Trade Routes, Conquistaspores.  Some are designed for 2 young kids; others are for 15 abstract thinkers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quarq games are more radically diverse than traditional card games.  They use almost any other mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As it is a game system, Quarq is also a creative medium.  &lt;br/&gt;At quarq.org, players can create new games, or post reviews of existing Quarq games.  They earn points for their participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
