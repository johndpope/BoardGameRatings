							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Death at Black Marble Quarry</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Marble Quarry is a recent attempt at expanding production within the local region. The quarry&amp;rsquo;s eponymous black marble is extremely rare, with only a few reliable mines located around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mine was also designed to serve a secondary purpose: as a privately run penal colony. Quarrymen are prisoners sent to work the quarry as punishment, with their living quarters located off-site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quarry has been running more or less smoothly for the better party of a year, but suddenly the entire quarry has gone silent. Kingdom officials have been sent to investigate - yet all have failed to return with news.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, with no other choice, the kingdom has started to send private adventurers to investigate and return the mine to proper working order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
