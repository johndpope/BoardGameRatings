							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dead Reefs</name>
									
			<description>It is said that for hundreds of years, pirates from the English island of Dead Reefs were looting the ships sailing by and slaughtering their crews. One of the wrecked ships was carrying an old relic, kept secret and locked by a centennial monk order. It is known to have been then stolen and retrieved by the ruler of the island, Baron DeSantra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shortly after, inhabitants of the island started dying in unnatural ways one by one. The first victim of this strange series of events was the Baron&amp;rsquo;s wife, who was killed by her husband with his sword.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten decades after these alleged &amp;ldquo;facts&amp;rdquo;, a new death is reminiscent of the legend and casts fear on the island of Dead Reefs. A detective from the mainland, Amadeo Finvinerro, is sent to investigate the death and find the killer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are this detective. And you will need more than natural skills to shed the light on this terrific case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dead Reefs&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
