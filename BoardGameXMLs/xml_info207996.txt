			<description>TAILITS is an abstract strategy game for 2 players, Black and White, based on the Japanese logic puzzle LITS, and inspired by the game TAIJI. It is a follow-up to Battle of LITS by the same designer. Starting with Black, players take turns placing L-, I-, T-, and S-shaped tetrominoes from a shared supply onto the board. There are three restrictions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Every new piece must share an edge with at least one of the pieces already on the board.&lt;br/&gt;2. No two congruent pieces may share an edge.&lt;br/&gt;3. No four cells in a 2x2 arrangement may all be covered by pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each piece has two black squares and two white squares. Players attempt to make large groups of squares of their color (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections count). When no more pieces can be played, whoever has the largest such group wins. In the event of a tie score, the player who made the last move wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
