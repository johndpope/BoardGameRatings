			<description>Sennen Kazoku (千年家族 Thousand Year Family?) is a life simulation game developed by Indieszero and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance. It was released only in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin by playing as Cupit, who have been asked by God to protect a particular family from dangers. Players spend their time in the game meddling in the lives of members of the family. The family members move about on their own, but players can shoot them with emotion arrows which change their actions, examples being &amp;quot;Work Hard Arrow&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Calm Down Arrow.&amp;quot; The goal of the game is to keep the family going over multiple generations, perhaps spanning a thousand years (hence the name).&lt;br/&gt;The game action is viewed from the side, with players looking into the family's home as big headed characters move about. To meddle in the path of a character, players merely select an emotion arrow from a menu and aim at the character. To help in the family management, players have quick access to stats about each member of the family along with a family tree. The game helps out by keeping an up-to-date listing all off happenings within the family.&lt;br/&gt;Sennen Kazoku makes use of the Game Boy Advance's internal clock. Even when the Game Boy Advance is off, the family will keep evolving. Players have to be sure and turn on your Game Boy Advance every now and then, or you'll miss key events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sennen Kazoku&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
