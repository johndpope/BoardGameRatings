			<description>Who Killed Devius Taxus?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 50 AD and the place is Ancient Rome. The last few days have seen the best Roman athletes, chariot racers and gladiators entertaining the vast crowds in the Colosseum and Circus Maximus. The Thermal Baths in Rome will be the venue for a lavish feast at which the cream of Rome's political and sporting societies will bathe and then feast. However, before the feast has begun Senator Devius Taxus is found dead in the plunge pool. Host your own party to discover how he came to meet such a steamy end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
