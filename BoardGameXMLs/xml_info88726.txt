							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">CONTACT! - The Canadian Army Tactical Training Wargame (1980)</name>
									
			<description>User's summary, partly paraphrased from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONTACT! is a set of tactical wargaming rules developed by the Canadian Army Combat Training Centre as a training aid. It is based on a simplified version of the &amp;quot;Wargames Rules for Armoured Warfare 1950-1985&amp;quot;, published by the Wargames Research Group (WRG) in 1979. It is played on a terrain model using miniatures representing single vehicles, infantry sections, and crew-served weapons. Players adopt the roles of commanders of platoon or company sized groups. The game requires at least a neutral player in the role of controller, who sets the scenario, supervises play and resolves disputes. Combat is resolved by percentile dice rolls on probability tables, modified by range, suppression status, movement and terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Editor John Curry added some weapon tables for the British and American Army, and additional information and order of battles for Canadian, Warsaw Pact and British forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
