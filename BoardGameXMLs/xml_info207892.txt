			<description>This card game is played with a 61-card deck. The deck has four suits (Star, Flag, Cross and Seal) each with cards numbered 1-15, along with a Koon card bearing the picture of a raccoon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt 10 cards each to start. On each turn, a player draws a card from the top of the remaining deck or of the discard pile, plays a set or more if he wishes, and discards a card. As in rummy, sets can be three or more of a kind or three or more of a suit in sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, in addition to laying down sets of their own, players may add cards to any set or sequence of any player on the board. The Koon card is wild and may be used in any set, but if it is played on the end of a sequence, the player holding that actual card may play it, and add the Koon to the other end of the sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to be the first player to empty his hand. The last card in a hand may be discarded or may be used in a set, with no discard. Other players add up the value of cards remaining in their hand and score that many points. Game winner is the one with the fewest points at the end of the agreed number of hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
