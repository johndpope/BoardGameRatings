			<description>Introducing The Game of Life: Yo-kai Watch edition game in which players choose to play as Nate, Katie, Bear, or Eddie, and then set off on exciting adventures! Players explore the city and discover Yo-kai in all different places -- on the beach, at the school, the forest, and at the park. The game spinner might send a player in an unexpected direction, but they can also use their Watch Detection Power cards to capture more Yo-kai! The first player to return home with 3 Yo-kai game medals wins! The game features 2 exclusive Yo-kai Medals (not part of the gameplay.) For 2 to 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
