							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Sun Campaign Map</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gale Force Nine&amp;rsquo;s Official DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS Campaign Maps are high-quality single-sided vinyl surfaces that are ideal for tracking the progress of your adventures during their campaigns! These maps lay flat for ease of play and are sold in sturdy polycarbonate tubes for easy storage and transport. The maps may be marked with WET-ERASE markers to temporarily record the paths your heroes travel, make notes about encounters and locations or the modify landscape to suit your own campaign. They also look great on the wall of your game room! The Campaign Maps measure 30&amp;quot; x 42&amp;quot;. All of GF9's Campaign Maps are based on artwork provided by Wizards of the Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I live in a world of fire and sand. The crimson sun scorches the life from anything that crawls or flies, and storms of sand scour the foliage from the barren ground. This is a land of blood and dust, where tribes of feral elves sweep out of the salt plains to plunder lonely caravans, mysterious singing winds call travelers to slow suffocation in the Sea of Silt, and selfish kings squander their subject&amp;rsquo;s lives building gaudy palaces and garish tombs. This bleak wasteland is Athas, and it is my home.&amp;quot; From The Wanderer's Journal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This campaign map details the world of Athas, the setting for DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS campaigns in DARK SUN. Packed with details, this map is a great way to chart your adventures across this dangerous and desolate landscape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
