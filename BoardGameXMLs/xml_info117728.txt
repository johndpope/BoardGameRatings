			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It Just Got Dangerous!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;101 Hazards and Disasters gives you&amp;mdash;yes, you guessed it&amp;mdash;101 new hazards and disasters that will help make encounters in your game truly perilous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From treacherous sites touched by powerful deities, to new unstable mosses, molds, and fungi that can grow at frightening speeds; to forbidden crystals that drive men mad, to horrific disasters like exploding lakes, tropical cyclones, and meteoric sites. 101 Hazards and Disasters brings a host of new options and risks to the lives of player characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wholly compatible with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, 101 Hazards and Disasters is designed so that hazards have variable challenge ratings to help suit the need of campaigns at any level of play. Almost every new hazard has a way to identify it before a PC becomes embroiled in its dangers. Along with ways to overcome, destroy or bypass these perils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get yours now and make your campaign hazardous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
