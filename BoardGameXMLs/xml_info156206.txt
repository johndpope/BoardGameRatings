							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trio</name>
									
			<description>Trio is a game for three, played an a grid of 52 triangular cells (in two alternating colors) arranged in the shape of an equilateral triangle, but with its corners cut off and replaced with a curved line connecting the outer edges of the board, forming its own cell.  Each of these additional cells is called a Fortress and belongs to a player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has three kinds of pieces in their own color: one General, four Officers, and seven Soldiers.  To begin the game, the General pieces are placed in the middle triangle of the first row adjoining that player's Fortress.  Filling out that row are the four Officers.  The next row inward has seven triangles and each are occupied by Soldiers.  These two rows are known as each player's Zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to move a General into an opponent's Fortress.  A cell may be occupied by only one piece at a time; players capture each other's pieces by landing on the same cell and removing the opponent's piece from the board.  Capture is not compulsory, and continuing moves after a capture is not permitted.  Movement of the pieces is through the sides of the triangular cells, not the points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Soldier moves to one adjacent cell in any direction except backwards towards his home Fortress.  An Officer moves across two adjacent cells, unless there is a piece he wishes to capture in one adjacent cell.  After capturing, he must remain in that cell until the next turn.  While in their own Zone, Officers may not move back towards their own Fortress.  Once out of their Zone, Officers may move in any direction.  Generals move across one or two adjacent cells in any combination of directions, so long as they do not return to the same cell on the same turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to move his General into an opponent's Fortress wins the game.  Since it is possible for any piece to capture any other piece, it is possible that all three Generals could be captured and no player would win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
