			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sinclair developed the ZX Spectrum 128 (code-named Derby) in conjunction with their Spanish distributor Investr&amp;oacute;nica. Investr&amp;oacute;nica had helped adapt the ZX Spectrum+ to the Spanish market after the Spanish government introduced a special tax on all computers with 64 KB RAM or less which did not support the Spanish alphabet (such as &amp;ntilde;) and show messages in Spanish.&lt;br/&gt;New features included 128 KB RAM, three-channel audio via the AY-3-8912 chip, MIDI compatibility, an RS-232 serial port, an RGB monitor port, 32 KB of ROM including an improved BASIC editor, and an external keypad.&lt;br/&gt;The machine was simultaneously presented for the first time and launched in September 1985 at the SIMO '85 trade show in Spain, with a price of 44,250 pesetas. Because of the large number of unsold Spectrum+ models, Sinclair decided not to start selling in the UK until January 1986 at a price of &amp;pound;179.95. No external keypad was available for the UK release, although the ROM routines to use it and the port itself, which was hastily renamed &amp;quot;AUX&amp;quot;, remained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
