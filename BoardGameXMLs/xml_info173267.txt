							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Donkey Derby</name>
									
			<description>Party game. In the box there is a roll of twine. This should be cut to 4 equal lengths. One end of the twine is tied to a chair leg and the other end is held by the players. So, the players at the starting line will all be holding a length of twine (about 12 feet long) and they must pull it backwards so that the twine doesn't sag in the middle and the line should be about 18 inches off the floor. Each player now has a 'Donkey' put on to their twine, as near to the players' as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the word &amp;quot;Off&amp;quot;, each player has to jog their twine furiously so that their donkey heads towards their chair. The first to touch the chair leg with their donkey's nose, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be modified to allow young children to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
