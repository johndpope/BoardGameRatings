							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Child Beauty Pageant Tycoon</name>
									
			<description>Child Beauty Pageant Tycoon is a game where you and your friends take the role of a mother whose greatest goal in life is to have her children win Beauty Pageants.  The first player to win five Beauty Pageant crowns wins the game.  There are 4 very different ways to make your Child ready to compete in a Pageant.  1) Spending a night with a Stud to give your child an edge from the very start. 2) Gaining experience by simply competing in Pageants. 3) Training your Child in a special Skill. 4) Buying a special 1-use Item to be used in any Pageant.  Each Pageant will have different entry fees and winnings, and they will focus on different stats.  When a pageant focuses on a stat, it counts for double towards winning the pageant.  For example, let's say Mary Beth has a 'Smarts' score of 3. In the Pageant shown above, she will get to double her smarts score and it will instead give her 6 points toward winning the Pageant!  Glitz or Talent stats still count toward winning, but they aren't doubled in this Pageant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
