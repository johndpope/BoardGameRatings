			<description>From the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than a game...&lt;br/&gt;A Horror Movie in Outer Space!&lt;br/&gt;The Monster: Bred for the mines... with an appetite for flesh!&lt;br/&gt;The Hero: Terminator or doomed fool? You decide.&lt;br/&gt;The Damsel in Distress: Sleeping. Unaware. And most likely dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An action-packed race against time. Battles to the death aboard a doomed, blood-smeared ship. A genetic experiment out of control... and on the prowl! The tragic results if you fail!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 disk sides. Tension-building musical score and sound effects. Pans, close ups, fades, montage... just like a movie. Includes a map of the ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A side scrolling, action/adventure game with cinema-like qualities.  You play the part of the hero, investigating a genetic experiment gone awry, aboard a spaceship. You uncover clues as to what happened, and battle against the clock to destroy an evil menace, save any survivors, and escape before the ship self-destructs. You'll have to manage your meager supply of ammo and health, navigate a complicated series of hatches and rooms, and use your wits to stay alive.  Survival-Horror in a sci-fi setting, with many &amp;quot;movie&amp;quot; moments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
