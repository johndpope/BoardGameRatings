			<description>Data Boxing features yesterdays legends and hall of famers reflecting the glory days of years gone by. You'll find Ali, Marciano, Dempsey, Louis, Tunney, Foreman, Frazier, Baer, Braddock and more.To quote the designer of the game, Dr. Julian Compton, from a Data Boxing Newsletter (in 1977), &amp;quot;One of the real thrills for this game player is to see the stars of the past come alive in a game structure. Usually these names will be familiar, but ever so often an unknown will rear his head in a bid for greatness.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data Boxing is &amp;quot;the boxer's Boxing Game&amp;quot;. It's a detailed, realistic simulation of boxing where boxers of all eras are matched.  There is a real component to it because it's based on the actual performance of boxers. Individual fighters are rated on cards, and bouts are resolved through dice and charts and/or rounds cards (see Data Boxing II below).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data Boxing is based on decades of study and research. It began as a research project in 1967 by humanities professor and boxing authority, Dr. Julian Compton (1940-2010). The heavyweights were evaluated on up to 155 variables. The table game first appeared in 1976. The computerized version was first released in 2004 which is set up similarly to the board game. The computer implementation was done by NASA programmer Don Mankowski.  Data Boxing was featured in the December 1977 edition of Ring Magazine, The People's Almanac [1978], Computer Sports Match-ups [1981] and in the December 13th, 2006 issue of the Tallahassee Democrat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
