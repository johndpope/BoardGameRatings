			<description>From the publishers web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Some fortunes are better left unread...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Greetings brothers, the time is nigh....Not all of us are strong enough to carry the blessings of the Ancient one. For his wisdom transcends the stars. His influence through our dreams and unspoken realms, deep beneath the sea, he waits. Dreaming for the day he shall be free. Even though we may be weak as mortals, he gathers strength from our devotion, hope through our determination, and power from our sacrifice. While we all wish to share in his gifts, the Great One only rewards those of purist faith. All others will be crushed beneath the waves when R&amp;rsquo;yleh rises from the deep.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cthulhu Fu is a variant of the popular Cookie Fu system where players take on the roles of rival cultists in dark cult world of Cthulhu (circa 1930). The cultists summon / manipulate the forces of darkness against each other and claim victory in the eyes of the great overlord. There are many ways to defeat your opponent: summon the forces of darkness to rip apart your foe or by shattering the barriers that protect his mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This stand alone game comes packed in a black mini take-out pail, 5 dice, rules menu and &amp;quot;Miskatonic Mint&amp;quot; flavored Omikuji (fortune cookie).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
