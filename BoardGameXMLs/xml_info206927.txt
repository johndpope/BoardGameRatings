			<description>F.L.O.W. is a cooperative time-traveling game where you are an agent of F.L.O.W., the Federal Land and Oceanic Workforce, entrusted with maintaining the Temporal Continuum and the fate of the human race. Connect pivotal locations in time, called nexuses, using chrono-streams (strings). Travel to nexuses, and shape events to architect a favorable ripple effect through the continuum. Can you and your team of F.L.O.W. agents complete the directives before time runs out?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over several rounds, each consisting of two phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Action Phase, you take a Time Crystals from the shared pool to take an action. You must coordinate with other players on what action you're taking and when you're taking the action. You may perform actions such as creating a chrono-stream, retrieving incident records from HQ, upgrading your bio-tech, and jumping along the time continuum. The phase ends when all Time Crystals are used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Flow Phase, you must coordinates the ripple effect of incidents along the time continuum. If you are not careful, you may create a paradox that could destroy the nexus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when you are either completed the directives, or when the time corruption reaches a critical level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
