			<description>&amp;quot;The game takes place in a futuristic world in the year 2155 where several factions are battling for control over the planet. The most important of these are the Federated States and the Eastern Confederation They are fighting over &amp;quot;No Man's Land&amp;quot;, what was once North America. Due to high levels of radiation, soldiers fight each other through the use of Mechanized Assault Vehicles, machines connected and remotely controlled by the minds of their pilots.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game is a mixture between first person shooters games such as Unreal Tournament 2004 and mecha simulation games such as MechWarrior. The player can select between two different factions and various different MAV types, with each being equipped with unique abilities and weapons. You can also customize your MAV to some extent, such as being able to trade speed for armor or vice versa. The game has support for various different playing modes, such as equivalents of Deathmatch and Capture the Flag. Players can switch between first-person or third-person view while playing the game. Although primarily focused on multiplayer, single-player is allowed through the use of computer controlled bots.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is currently available as a free download.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dark Horizons: Lore,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
