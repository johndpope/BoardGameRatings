							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Q-Back Football Game</name>
									
			<description>Detailed football simulation created and produced back in 1989 by an avid football fan. A two-player game, players make decisions about what plays to run on offense and defense like American Football. Like American Football, the winner is the player who successfully scores the most points via touchdowns and field-goals. The game comes with a special count-down timer to be used for the game clock and the play clock, and is used to help determine penalties or substitutions. Only a handful of copies of the game were created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
