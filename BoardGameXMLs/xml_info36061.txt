			<description>&amp;ldquo;You guessed it. Rival space empires are at it again. A card game for 2 or more players.&amp;rdquo; The object of the game is to capture the Homeworlds of all your opponents. The game is played with a custom deck of 75 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players earn Credits by controlling Sectors of space. Credits may be used to open new Sectors and to put Fleets and Leaders into play. Credits may also be used to research one of the nine types of technology. The level of technological development plays into the combat system, which is the means by which enemy fleets and sectors are destroyed and Homeworlds are captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
