							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Encounter at Hanover</name>
									
			<description>Encounter at Hanover is a promotional game for the town of Hanover, Pennsylvania, sponsored by the Hanover General Hospital Auxiliary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hanover is mostly famous for being the site of an American Civil War battle in the Gettysburg campaign.  While the name of the game (the same as a book on the battle) and the box cover (which shows ACW soldiers) suggest a wargame of some kind, the game is in fact similar to Monopoly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in Monopoly players move around the board buying properties and improving them.  Here the properties are local Hanover business and the improvements are franchises instead of houses .  The rules are similar to Monopoly's with some exceptions, the main one being that ownership of a group is not required for development, but owning three properties in a row triples rent on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
