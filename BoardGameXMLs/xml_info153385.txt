							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Witching Hour</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Witching Hour is an intermediary adventure for the Contagion Role Playing Game. The world of Contagion is a dark and terrifying place. On the surface it is no different than the world you and I live in. Most people go on about their lives never realizing the terrors that walk among them. Despite humanity's vast ignorance, the horrors are there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Witching Hour pulls the characters deeper into the Contagion setting. In this adventure, a strange but alluring woman has come to the home city of the characters (or a city nearby) and set up shop. Soon after Natalie&amp;rsquo;s arrival, missing persons reports seem to increase. The characters notice that the various supernatural factions of the city seem to have access to many more magic items. Slayers and cultists both seem to be showing up with magic tattoos with a frequency that can be no coincidence. In addition, those in the know claim that this woman knows the secret of eternal youth. Could the characters benefit from this woman? Is she a monster that must be stopped?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geared toward advanced characters, The Witching Hour is designed for 4-6 players of 4th to 7th level. People familiar with other role playing games will find something unusual in the design concept of The Witching Hour. Rather than being a linear module with events that go from point A to point B, this adventure offers a story seed. Basic events are illustrated, along with character snapshots. The ending is left open and ambiguous, for the Gamemaster to decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Witching Hour includes expanded setting and system information including a new spell: Steal Life and a new wondrous item: The Necklace of Eminence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
