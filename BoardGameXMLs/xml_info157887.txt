			<description>from the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;What Makes Saga Unique, Why Choose Saga?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Saga is a universal system: Saga can run a campaign in any genre or campaign-setting!&lt;br/&gt;     Combat is deadly, realistic, and fast paced!&lt;br/&gt;     Saga is narrative and non-combat-oriented; non-combat skills are important in Saga!&lt;br/&gt;     Saga is skill-based; there are no levels in Saga!&lt;br/&gt;     Character creation is flexible, intelligent, and realistic! Players create and play the character they want to play!&lt;br/&gt;     There are no class-based restrictions or penalties! Players make choices and play characters the way they want to play.&lt;br/&gt;     There are no racist stereotypes, restrictions, or penalties! Races and their individuals are diverse and multifaceted as in reality.&lt;br/&gt;     Magic is chaotic, unpredictable, arcane, and magical! There are no formulaic spells and lists in Saga, and magic is apt to have negative consequences when it fails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THIS Core Rulebook MANUAL CONTAINS&lt;br/&gt;everything you need to play a campaign in any genre or campaign-setting. The rules cover combat, magic and psionics, stealth, crafting, diplomacy, other non-combat skills, large-scale warfare, physical needs, disease, poison, equipment, weapons and armor, and much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
