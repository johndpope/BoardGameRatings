			<description>Six brave fourth-graders join forces to protect the playground from the tyrannical Dark Prince Ipal, but only one of them can be crowed Spell Master. Overcome treacherous obstacles and defeat the evils of recess by spelling!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Magical Spell, you create words to earn dice, which you use to overcome enemies and obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, players will assemble Letter Cards to create words. Each letter grants the caster dice. The more rare the letter, the more powerful the die. To defeat encounters, players must exceed or match a combat value. Defeat the enemy and gain victory points. Fail and take wounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magical Spell includes a deck of Letter Cards which also grant special abilities. Use F to create fire spells, or H to heal. The game is played with a polyhedral set of dice and invokes the feel of a light dungeon crawl set in the imagination of elementary school kids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
