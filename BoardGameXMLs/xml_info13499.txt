							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Technopoly</name>
									
			<description>Technopoly transports players from the familiar lanes of Monopoly's New Jersey to the bustling lands of Silicon Valley. Based on familiar rules and layout, this game offers much that is new. This game is similar to Monopoly but has more strategy and requires more choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing track is mostly two-way and has several sub-paths. Players compete for contracts with computer manufacturers, network developers, and military suppliers. The opportunities for following directions, problem-solving, and social brinkmanship are many. Jim McBurney has detailed each technology on the cards, but no knowledge of computers or technology is necessary for play, any more than you need a degree in hotel management to play Monopoly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some players may miss the familiar names like Board Walk or Marvin Gardens, but techies will appreciate being able to buy UNISYS &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; SERIES and XEROX ETHERNET.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
