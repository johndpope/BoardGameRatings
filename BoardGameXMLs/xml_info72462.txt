			<description>From back of box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You are a Space Alien and you need Earthlings for a sinister and mysterious goal known only to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use your alien mind-control powers to manipulate Earthlings into doing your bidding and use your ship to blast your foes in this action packed game of deception and intergalactic mayhem&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earthling Abductor is a quick, simple card game with a strong memory element. Players assume the role of alien species competing to abduct and control Earthlings. Cards represent Earthlings (human and otherwise). Cards in a player's hand are Earthlings that have been previously abducted, and can now be activated by their alien overlords to do nefarious tasks - most frequently abducting more Earthlings. Cards face-down at various locations on the table represent Earthlings to be abducted. The face-down stacks at each location are built up by players during the course of the game; thus each player potentially has some knowledge about what types of Earthlings are at each location, which is where memory becomes involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move their spaceship tokens from location to location, abducting Earthlings (moving some of the face-down cards away from the location), and then fly back to their homeworlds to score them. Some Earthlings cause trouble when they are abducted (damaging the spaceship), while other may offer benefits while they are aboard. Players can also directly and indirectly attack other players' spaceships, to either prevent them from completing their abduction goals or sometimes to steal dangerous Earthlings without suffering the consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players win by successfully abducting 10 Earthlings and returning them to their homeworld. Each player also has a secret objective which allows them to win with a smaller number of Earthlings, such as six of the same species or 7 of the same gender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earthling Abductor: Deluxe Edition contains 68 Earthling cards, 7 Alien races, and 6 plastic space-ships. It supports 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earthling Abductor also comes in a non-Deluxe edition, in a smaller box containing 44 Earthling cards, 4 Alien races, and 4 plastic space-ships. It supports 2 players. The two versions are otherwise identical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
