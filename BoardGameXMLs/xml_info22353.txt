			<description>A game with unusual equipment. One player is the &amp;quot;detective&amp;quot;, he holds a special magnifying glass in which a tile is inserted. The magnifying glass only lets him or her see a tiny piece of the tile; so it has to be moved back and forth to find out what the tile shows. In the meantime, however, the other player are trying to roll a little metal ball into a hole on their special clocks, the hole having been determined by the detective first. As soon as a player has gotten the ball in the right hole, the detective has to show the picture from the tile on the game board, if successful, he or she can keep it. The magnifying glass is passed on to the next player. The player who wins most tiles wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
