			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eyecatcher Junior challenges kids to match game tiles to the gameboard. First, all the tiles are turned face down and then kids race against the timer to place as many tiles on the symmetrical board as possible. The tiles may look simple, but are designed around unique animal pairs that will test children's identification and motor skills. At the end of each player's turn, the total number of tiles placed correctly on the board are counted and recorded on the unique score sheet. Kids can play as many rounds as they want and best of all the game cannot be mastered since each turn presents a completely new challenge. Eyecatcher Junior encourages kids to concentrate carefully while acting quickly and they have lots of fun doing it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
