			<description>Little Fighter Online (LFO, Chinese: 小朋友齊打交 Online) is a fighting game for Windows which is popular at start in Hong Kong, but has shown a rapid decline in popularity in its progress. The gameplay itself is based on the earlier Little Fighter 2 game, which had many of the same features at first glance. The game was produced by Marti Wong (involved in all LF games) and Oscar Chu, a Chinese MMO developer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Little Fighter Online&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
