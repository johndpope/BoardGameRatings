							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nanofeasters</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning&lt;br/&gt;All Nano-Feasters (homo sapiens horribilis) over 8 years of age must obtain a transit authorization while within the Greater Bay Area. Log on to the San Francisco Police Department public mesh site (#SFPD.mesh/TreatyofBoston/Enforcement) at least 14 days in advance of any visit to the greater San Francisco metropolitan area. Nano-Feasters without current and valid transit authorization may be detained until their Treaty of Boston status can be verified, and may face deportation, at their own expense, to their home of record.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanofeasters are an engineered predatory species designed by the Lifer Army of God as a weapon against their Choicer adversaries. Unlike other engineered species, Nanofeasters have never been force-grown in womb tanks; all the members of this subspecies are the product of fetal genetic alteration performed on pregnant mothers who volunteered themselves and their children for the procedure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first generation of Nanofeasters were born just a few years prior to Life Tank&amp;rsquo;s 2061 rampage, and spent the first years of their childhood sequestered at one of the AOG&amp;rsquo;s many hidden bases. When these mutates first stepped onto the battlefield as teenaged killers, they were a terrifying shock for the Choicer military. Dark rumors whispered that the Nanofeaster genome came from deepest space. However, the Nanofeasters are anything but Lifechained. Instead, the robust Nanofeaster genome is a corruption of human DNA, an engineered atavism mingled with purpose-grown nanotech weapons slaved to the monster&amp;rsquo;s marrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, the engineering of new Nanofeasters is prohibited by the Treaty of Boston, and the mutagens used to create the creatures were supposedly destroyed after War&amp;rsquo;s End. However, new Nanofeasters are born with surprisingly regularity; cross-breeding Nanofeasters and other 4 post-human children is a high priority for the current Lifer leadership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
