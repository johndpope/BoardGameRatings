			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crafts and professions are useful skills for just about any player, but where exactly do players go to master their chosen fields of expertise?  Adventure Havens:  Guild Houses offers twelve ready-to-use guilds for your d20/OGL games.  Each guild is fully developed with a detailed history, important NPCs, and story seeds that can be easily folded into your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have a player that needs to visit the mage's guild to learn new spells?  Is your rogue looking for a discreet place to pick up more caltrops?  Does your warrior need access to a forge to craft his new blade?   Don't just hand-wave these details.  Make them part of the game the way they should be!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the guild information, you'll also find new rules for crafting masterpiece items.  Your players will want to learn how they can benefit from these exceptional items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
