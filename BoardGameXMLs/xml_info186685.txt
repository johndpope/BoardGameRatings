			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Neo-Troops, players run characters that are bio-engineered super-varans--large reptilian humanoids.  Super-Varans begin life with no feelings, no personality, no memories, and no personal motivations, existing only to complete missions.  They belong to a specific Type (similar to class in most systems) that defines not only their abilities but their role in missions.  Types include: Standard, Assault, Firepower, and Scout.  Some varans (predominantly Standard Type) receive additional enhancements to support mission role.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Varans are defined as much by the extensive high tech equipment they carry as they are by their consciousness.  The rules present numerous types of equipment--nearly all weapons, armors, or soldier supports.  Drugs are widely used as performance enhancers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
