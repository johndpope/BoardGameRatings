			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's only natural for politicians to be two-faced...especially when they've been cloned!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When legendary superthief Red Robin was hired to break into U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney's home office and abscond with some documents, she thought it would be an easy job. But then she found herself in the middle of vast conspiracy--an effort by The Editor and his evil cohorts to replace important leaders with clones!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Robin vs. The Editor &amp;amp; The Clones of Mitt Romney introduces a Clone mechanic useful for those gamers who actually like using ROLF! for more than just one-offs, while giving creative souls raw material to spin ROLF! battle scenarios off from this product. (And if you send them to us, you too can be a published game designer and admired by dozens of people!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It also features three pre-generated characters, new traits, and the usual assortment of new battle scenarios and combat maneuvers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Editor is taking his red pen to the world! Stop him before it's too late!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
