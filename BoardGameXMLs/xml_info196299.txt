							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lady and the Tower</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players in the game assume defined roles - the Lady, the Lord, the Bishop, and minor roles.  The game utilizes a series of custom cards than must be prepared prior to play, and that are physically (partially) destroyed during play (note this is consonant with the &amp;quot;Last Chance&amp;quot; nature of the competition for which this game was designed).  The scenario can be completed multiple times with decreasing enjoyment.  Play proceeds in turns, players taking action at any time as long as every player takes one action in every turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards needed are included as print-and-play components of the document, though after printing they must be assembled (directions are included).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
