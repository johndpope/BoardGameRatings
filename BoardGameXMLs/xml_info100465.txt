							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NHL Big League Manager: Junior Edition</name>
									
			<description>Among the new features: player cards featuring NHL teams which allow Junior GM's to earn extra points by matching three or five of a kind ( from the same team). This game was also where we first developed the simplified scoring system which we liked so much, we used it for the Platinum Edition. &lt;br/&gt;Junior General Managers draft players, makes trades and can even grab a free agent from rival General Manager. Finally, the perfect board game for young hockey fans!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to build the strongest team of players best able to win hockey games all while balancing the difficult task of being a general manager. Your team is then pitted against your opponents. The winner of 5 games wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
