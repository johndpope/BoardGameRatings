			<description>This is a 4-player partnership version of the game Duck Soup. It is played with two deck of standard cards. Each player is dealt 13 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two phases (caleed Duck course and, after thirteen tricks, Soup course) with different trick-taking rules. The trick is taken by the exact duplicate of the card played, or failing that the last-played card of the same rank as the one led, or, failing that: the lowest card of the suit led in the first half of the game (Duck), or the highest in the second half (Soup). Another difference is that Aces are low during the Duck course and high during the Soup course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final score of a partnership is the number of cards won by a player multiplied by the number of card won by his partner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
