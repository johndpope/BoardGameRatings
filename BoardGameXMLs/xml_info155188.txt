			<description>Shienryu (Gekioh: Shooting King on PS1) is a vertical scrolling shooter created by Warashi for the arcade which was released in 1995, later followed by a Sega Saturn console release in 1997 and Sony PlayStation release in 1999 (JP) and 2002 (US).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking place in the distant future, Earth's people starts their search for new planets to colonize, specifically those similar to it. The colony ships, known as the Caravans, travel deep into space until Caravan 7861 discovers a suitable fourth planet from an alien sun. However, none of the other Caravans had followed. After 93 years of civilization on the new Mother Planet, the investigation of the missing Caravans finally leads to a horrible discovery: the previous Caravans had been attacked and conquered by a powerful regime of alien-humans. Commanded by the mysterious Shienryu, the alien space fleet invades the Mother Planet and constructs fortresses across the world, destroying and replacing any established human influence. In response, a defense team called &amp;quot;Burn Dragoon&amp;quot; is founded which calls for the best pilots and navigators to defend the new planet from the invading regime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control either of two double-piloted ships going against the bases of the regime based both on the new mother planet and in space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survival is a great emphasis in gameplay as enemies will fire blankets of pulse shots across the screen, some larger than others and some taking on wide intricate patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extends are awarded to players who reach an indicated score (the score is changeable in the Saturn version) as well as 1Ups, though both 1Ups and even 2Ups are available after defeating minibosses in a certain amount of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Shienryu&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
