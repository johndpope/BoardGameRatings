							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Supercards: Perú Campeón</name>
									
			<description>Supercards is a football card game for 2 players (with an additional solitaire mode). Each player holds five hand cards and tries to form effective combos which enable them to shoot at the opponents goal. The opponent can use block or counterattack cards, but since hands are refilled at the beginning of a turn, one can try to attack when the opponent is low on cards to maximize one's chances. Some special cards simulate fan support and specially gifted players. &lt;br/&gt;There is a game end card somewhere in the bottom half of the draw pile. When that appears, each player has another two turns before the final whistle sounds. Whoever scored more goals, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the solitaire mode, the player plays their way through a world cup with group and knock out stages. The opponent is randomized with a simple system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
