			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tired of the same old Sorcerer? Want an arcane caster that's got a little more spice? Well, The Le Games is here to help! The Sorcerer is back, and this time she's taking names! Unorthodox Sorcerers is full of new classes and game material!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this book you will find 5 new and exciting Sorcerer classes that will spice up any fantasy game! Each new class comes with a complete history and a full 20 levels!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by John Walsh, and an extraordinary cover by Carrie Hall, this book takes you new depths with the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing God - a story written by Martin Jenner that explores the classic battle of good vs. evil!&lt;br/&gt;The Farm Boy - a story written by Melinda Moore that asks &amp;quot;what if a common girl went on a date with a sorcerer?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Numeromantic Sorcerer - Numeromantic Sorcerers are the masters and mistresses of the use of numbers. Perhaps as child prodigies, they found a natural facility for division, multiplication and all forms of digital manipulation. However, these Sorcerers go beyond the norm when they realize that numbers have not just a mundane meaning, but also a magical one. Words and numbers are but different aspects of the same universal language. Hence, the adept manipulator of numbers can use these to substitute them for the words used in creating magic and casting spells.&lt;br/&gt;Occult Detective - Occult Detectives are the police force of the magical world. Whether they work for an official organization or as freelancers, their intentions are to discover as much as possible about incidents (particularly criminal incidents) in which magic was employed. As a result, they have developed a range of forensic and investigative techniques to assist them in their inquiries. Either working freelance or for an organized agency, Occult Detectives travel the planes seeking answers to puzzles, crimes and enigmas; they also seek to identify, locate and bring to justice any perpetrators of magical crimes. Naturally, this can be a dirty, dangerous, and thankless job because not everybody agrees on the definition of crime.&lt;br/&gt;The Suppresser - There are many people in the world who believe that knowledge and power is best restricted to those who deserve them and who know how to value them. They resent the idea that power, especially magical power, should be available to the common riff-raff. Not only are they resentful, they have the resources to do something about it. One way to keep power for the powerful is the sponsorship of a branch of Sorcerers known as Suppressers.&lt;br/&gt;Immanent Heresiarch - An Immanent Heresiarch is a Sorcerer who believes in the ability of human beings (and to some extent other sentient creatures) to realize a transcendental potential within them that is the equal of or greater than that of any gods known in the multiverse. As a result, according to Immanent Heresiarchs, there is no need for humanity to bow down before the gods but should instead work to rid the world of them. Obviously, this must be done in secret since currently the gods still possess greatly more power than does humanity.&lt;br/&gt;Sixfold Septateuch - Followers of the Sixfold Septateuch are members of a fanatical religious cult that believes in the forthcoming end of existence, and the need for individuals to please the demon god Zhag-Skre through a rigorous meditation and physical disciplines. In a further unusual dogmatic belief, Followers of the Sixfold Septateuch will only accept Sorcerers within their ranks, believing that only those have any chance in surviving beyond the end of the current form of existence, which will begin an era in which seven dimensions will dominate.&lt;br/&gt;Pyramid Mage - a special prestige class that uses the power of the pyramid!&lt;br/&gt;New Sorcerer Spells - Fantastic new spells written by Tony DiGerolamo!&lt;br/&gt;Baubles &amp;amp; Urus - these tiny artifacts are written by The Le are are welcome in any group!&lt;br/&gt;Sorcerer Song - this is an exclusive new mp3 song, produced by our friends at Bailey Records (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.BaileyRecords.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.BaileyRecords.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
