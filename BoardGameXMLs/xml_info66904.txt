							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Naughty Tentacles Sourcebook</name>
									
			<description>This sourcebook is largely what it says on the tin, although it has a large focus on paranormal effects.  From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This sourcebook is designed to provide rules to allow GMs to use the Fuzion rules set to play games in the horror anime genre, also known as the Slimy Tentacles genre or Naughty Tentacles genre. These rules can be used as a stand-alone sourcebook for that genre, or you may use them as an enhancement to the many Fuzion-based anime RPGs already on the market, including Bubblegum Crisis and Armored Trooper Votoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Naughty Tentacles are just that, &amp;lsquo;naughty&amp;rsquo;. Most of the material produced in this genre revolves around demons and aliens who are... perverse. In an extreme. They run around using their tentacles for some very sick things, which will be detailed in the various appendices in this sourcebook. However, not all of it is like that. After all, Rumiko Takahashi's Inu Yasha and Mermaid Saga tales are also a part of the naughty tentacles genre. The genre is a rather widespread subject, ranging from rather tame PG-rated anime all the way to very explicit X-rated animation. For each of these sub-genres, we will provide an appendix detailing unique rules and notes for each of them, as well as a recommended viewing list.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
