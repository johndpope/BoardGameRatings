			<description>Wizard101 is a 3D massively multiplayer online role-playing game created by KingsIsle Entertainment. Players take on the role of students of Wizardry to save the Spiral (which is the set of worlds this game takes place in), and battle a variety of creatures by casting spells using a turn-based combat system similar to collectible card. Players advance in the game by accepting quests to learn new spells, gain equipment, and collect gold. The game holds a rating of &amp;quot;Everyone 10+&amp;quot; from the Entertainment Software Ratings Board for crude humor and mild fantasy violence. Although designed for pre-teens, the game appeals to all ages.&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning the player controls a novice wizard, who is named by the player using a set of words at the start of the game. That wizard joins the Ravenwood School of Magical Arts, a school of wizardry located in a fictional town called Wizard City. Instead of the traditional character classes, Wizard101 offers players a choice among seven different &amp;quot;magic schools&amp;quot; (Fire, Ice, Storm, Myth, Life, Death, and Balance) which will influence character development and parts of the magical spells (in form of collectible cards) available to the player in combat.&lt;br/&gt;In Wizard101, the different areas accessible to players are referred to as &amp;quot;worlds&amp;quot;. Upon character creation, only a part of Wizard City (The Commons, Ravenwood, Unicorn Way, Olde Town, Shopping District, Triton Avenue, Golem Court, and a short introduction to the world of Grizzleheim) is opened to access. As the player progresses, more worlds become available. Availability depends on subscriptions and/or the purchase of crowns. People who purchase memberships receive special privileges and gifts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Wizard101&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
