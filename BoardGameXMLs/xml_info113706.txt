			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An arcade version of the World War II Battle of Leyte Gulf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game featured four different action sequences each linked to a main campaign map. The player was tasked with sailing a battleship, troop transport, and aircraft carrier through the Leyte Gulf in order to attack and capture at least three out of four Japanese bases on different islands. Fleet commands were issued from the map screen and a bridge screen that allowed the player to switch from station to station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the player encountered an enemy at sea or attacked an island, the game switched to one of the arcade sequences. This might involve: an anti-aircraft target shoot vs. kamikaze planes, a ship-to-ship main gun duel, a dive bombing sequence vs. an enemy surface ship (these could be tricky), or a ship-to-shore surface bombardment target shoot (the goal here being to destroy as many enemy beach guns as possible before sending in the Marines).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game featured a very mild supply maintenance system; the player had to try to limit damage to the fleet as much as possible while keeping an eye on the fleet's fuel supply and finite number of Marines. Whenever a beach was attacked, the player had to decide on how many men to send to the beach. A stalled attack would cost more lives and force the player to attack the beach again, thus reducing the number of ready Marines on the transport. If too many men were lost then the player's mission could not be completed. Men could also be lost if the transport took too much damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the danger of reaching a &amp;quot;no victory&amp;quot; condition, the player could also run out of time before capturing enough enemy bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar games to this one included Destroyer, Beach Head / Beach Head II, Dive Bomber and Destroyer Escort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
