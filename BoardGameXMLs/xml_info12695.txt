			<description>In Ancient Greece, a Museion (Museum in Latin) was originally a temple for the worship of the Muses, later becoming a place dedicated to works inspired by these goddesses.  The nine Muses were believed to provide mankind with inspiration for all the fine arts and sciences and worship of them was often celebrated with contests of music and poetry and games of skill and knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created for The Fitzwilliam Museum by Oxford Games, Inspiration is a game of skill and knowledge with a difference&amp;mdash;here the answer is provided and you have to supply the question!  The object is to write a plausible question for the given answer in order to bluff fellow players into believing that your question is in fact the correct one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of play, you may select one of the nine Muses to be your inspiration throughout the game.  In each round, one player picks up an Answer &amp;amp; Question card and reads the answer aloud.  The other players write down (in secret) a plausible question for this given answer.  All efforts are handed to the reader.  The reader then reads out all the questions (including the question written on the answer card) taking care to disguise the author of each.  Players take it in turn to select the question they believe is the one given on the Answer and Question card.  When all players have chosen, the actual authors are revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;Forty-five Muse cards (five of each of nine Muses)&lt;br/&gt;One hundred and fifty-five double-sided Answer and Question cards&lt;br/&gt;Score pad&lt;br/&gt;Six pencils&lt;br/&gt;A Rules of Play and Information Scroll&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
