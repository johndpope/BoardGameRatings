							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Parasite</name>
									
			<description>Parasites have invaded a zoo in a small town. They are moving from host to host trying to exploit all the different animals. Players will take on the role of parasites and their respective hosts in an attempt to gain or steal the most points by the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with a deck of cards containing a set of colored host cards for each player numbered 2,3,4 and 5. The deck also contains special action cards, one for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will also receive four parasite tokens of their selected color valued 1,2,3 and 4. The players colored host cards and parasite tokens represent potential points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with one card turned face up next to the draw pile. Drawn cards will be placed next to this card. A new row will start after five cards have been drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn players can (1) place a parasite on a host card, (2) move a parasite to an adjacent host or action card, (3) draw a card to place in play or (4) pass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing a card will activate a scoring phase. All previous cards are then evaluated for scoring condition. Cards of your color without any parasite tokens score the full value for the player. Cards with parasites where the value of the parasites are of less than value that the host card it is on will score points for the owner of the parasite and card owner. EXAMPLE: A three green parasite on a five blue host card will score three points for green and two points for blue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards where the total of the parasites is equal to or more than the host card total, will NOT score for either player. Action cards allow players to perform a special action like move other players tokens or look through the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over when all the cards have been drawn and placed into the play area. The player with the highest point after all the cards have been drawn is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
