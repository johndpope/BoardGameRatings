			<description>User Summary: The player's guide for the revised edition of the Chronicles of Ramlar. Nominated for an ENnie Award in 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RAMLAR: WHAT IS IT?&lt;br/&gt;The Chronicles of Ramlar is a fantasy roleplaying game set on Eranon,&lt;br/&gt;one of the two major continents on a world created by Ramlar, the Maker of All. The premise behind the game is to create your own heroes and weave their self-authored chapters of legend and immortalized legacy in to The Book- the ultimate annals chronicling Ramlar&amp;rsquo;s world. Will it be easy? No, otherwise anybody could do it. Not everyone is capable of slaying dragons and monstrous creatures terrorizing the countryside, banishing rapacious entities with the sole arsenal of divine faith, or channeling the mystical energy of the leylines to defend entire civilizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And in your exploits, you may experience any of the wonders Ramlar wrought upon his world, from the exhilarating height of the Cliffs of Eternity to the soul-screaming depth of The Mouth, from the monumental Arbor Palace to perhaps the fabled Hethmarkn archive where The Book rests and epic tales culminate. Tales that could be your tales. Maybe you will choose to side with the Druegarn and their fellow spawn of the Dark God Gabrun. Perhaps you will oppose the honored warriors on the battlefield of the next Dakass Luot, prefacing the Song of Unmaking. Whatever your destiny, the power to cement your glory lies in your hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your chapter in The Chronicles of Ramlar has just begun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REVISED EDITION? WHAT ABOUT THE PREVIOUS ONE?&lt;br/&gt;Good question. Apart from being &amp;quot;bigger, better, faster!!!&amp;quot; this version is compatible with the first edition (save for the inclusion of &amp;quot;Expertise&amp;quot; which overhauled and supplanted the original skill system). All additions presented herein expand and improve upon the original game system. All you&amp;rsquo;ll need to make are a few quick and simple conversions and you&amp;rsquo;re good to go....We want to make it as breezy as possible for Ramlar fans to upgrade their game at nominal or no extra expense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
