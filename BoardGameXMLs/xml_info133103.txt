			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes a GM wants to spark some interest and mystery via some object the player characters find. Even without handing out a major magic item, a GM can make a world seem more in-depth by providing some colorful items that suggest they have a back-story behind them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To assist in such efforts, this second volume of The Genius Guide to What&amp;rsquo;s in My Pocket? provides some more odd little items, none of which will be of great use to players, but all of which might pique their interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These items were designed to encourage players to ask questions and to act as starting points for GMs who wanted to introduce some new story hooks. The accompanying story seeds are creative motes and ideas rather than specific story elements, and they are best used by GMs who like creating stories and rumors on the fly. Even if one of these items doesn&amp;rsquo;t encourage further investigation when found, it may provide another great opportunity for a GM to create a colorful background when characters attempt to sell it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When magical, the items list their aura, caster level, and construction requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
