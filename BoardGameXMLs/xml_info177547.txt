			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Arman and the Nasians share a number of common traits. Both are taller than the human norm and share characteristically blonde hair. However, they live on opposite sides of the world of NeoExodus. One man thinks he holds the key to proving that both share common ancestry. All he requires is a group of adventurers to escort him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exodus boasts a turbulent history&amp;mdash;from the rise of the Kaga to the defeat of the First Ones and the events of the Twilight War. From creation of the Imperial Alliance to the present crisis that threatens to tear that alliance apart. Great heroes and terrible villains drove its march, though even in hindsight the two are not always easily separated. Theirs were the titanic passions, the burning obsessions, and base treacheries in which modern Exodus was forged and tempered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Exodus needs heroes...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this adventure you will find you'll need to embark on adventures in the exciting setting of NeoExodus: A House Divided. The Origin of Man adventure will serve as an adventure and showcase of the NeoExodus: A House Divided campaign setting and its unique differences from all the other gaming campaigns on the market. An adventure for 7th level characters for the Pathfinder Role Playing Game. The Origin of Man adventure was written by the former Pathfinder Society Denver Venture Captain and NeoExodus Creative Designer, J.P. Chapleau.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
