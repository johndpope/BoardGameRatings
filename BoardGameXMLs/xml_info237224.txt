							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">On the Trail of the Gods</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the inventors Edison and Armstrong set out on their first journey to Mars in 1870, there has been speculation about visitors from other worlds to Earth as early as the prehistoric times of mankind. Archaeologist Alastair Whitman believes he has found proof. The characters are invited to join the Glasgow International Exhibition in 1888 where they can learn about the latest technological inventions and even meet celebrities like Nicola Tesla. When the exhibition receives threats, they realize that Whitman&amp;rsquo;s discovery might be an explosive issue: Not just scientists are interested in it, and the characters have to take care that this knowledge does not fall into the wrong hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is set on Earth, especially in Glasgow (Scotland), Egypt, and the Sudan. The characters will journey through the Sudan where they will have to beware many dangers, such as the followers of the Mahdi, who are fighting about his succession. A long journey up the Nile will take them into currently unstable territories where the characters will be on their own. Will they choose the right company? Will they achieve the rescue of Whitman and escape his persecutors? The characters will learn the answer On the Trail of the Gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventurers can be of any nationality, even if the starting point of this journey is set in Scotland. The events in this adventure challenge various archetypes, especially Academics, Discoverers, Reporters, Scientists, and Soldiers, but other adventurous characters will be just as useful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
