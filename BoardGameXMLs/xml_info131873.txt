Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it unless given direct written permission from the publisher which must be noted in the image caption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of travelers, organized and sent by members of Capital City&amp;rsquo;s elite, are checking in on the locals of Southridge. A recent Bandit attack has left the town shaken and splintered into two factions, as they are baffled to why a popular Steam Mech Technician was kidnapped. What are the Bandits planning? And why did they single her out?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now it's up to these travelers, or this band of &amp;ldquo;outsiders&amp;rdquo; as the locals of Southridge call them, to piece together the events that lead up to this abduction. The Mayor, Terexx A. Smyth, seems to know a lot more than he&amp;rsquo;s saying, or is it the subtle Chief of Security, an ex-Jagger by the name of Richter, who&amp;rsquo;s really running the show?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab a revolver, and it's time to earn some respect the hard way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Welcome to Fort South Ridge&amp;hellip;The southern-most territory in all of, well, civilized Westward. Hell, we are the only thing that&amp;rsquo;d be dividin&amp;rsquo; the badlands from those so-called civilized people. You&amp;rsquo;re new here, ain&amp;rsquo;t yah? Well, one thing's for damn sure, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn this real quickly that we watch each other&amp;rsquo;s back here and ain&amp;rsquo;t busy stabbin&amp;rsquo; them. Enjoy your stay. Richter will take it over from here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;- Mayor Terexx A. Smyth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
