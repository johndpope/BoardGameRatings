			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plot line is a father trying to get through a swamp in search of his lost son, but the real point is to navigate through platformer puzzles using a light that overlays the base screen with other steps, levels, cogwheels, and lanterns.   The dull grey-brown of the swamp still shows, while a small circle around your character is illuminated in mostly bright greens to show the other level.  Eventually you meet up with level bosses to defeat in order to resolve the plot.   This game won quite a few awards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
