			<description>Players fly their airplane from airport to airport across the United States.  The goal is to deliver passengers to their destination airports.  Players need to decide which passengers to carry on each leg of a journey to maximize the effectiveness of the trip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action cards allow special moves such as non-stop flights.  Players can thwart their opponents by blocking flight paths to airports or loading opponent's passengers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to deliver the most passengers to their respective destinations by the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features a large playing board representing 19 major and minor airports in the USA, 6 plastic passenger planes, and nearly 100 passenger pieces in two sizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Selected for GAMES Magazine's 1986 Games 100 under the heading The Race is On.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
