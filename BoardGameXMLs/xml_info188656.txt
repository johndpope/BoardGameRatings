			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This tongue in cheek adventure brings new PCs into a small town after an adventure. Upon arrival they quickly discover that the small agricultural community has just been robbed of its harvest supply. With the seasonal change coming those supplies are necessary for the town's survival. One of the victims of the attack was an alchemist. Contained within his bag were a few Potions of Growth. The bitter taste of the potion disagreed with the bandit who discovered it and he flung it into a field. Unfortunately for the PCs oversized fowl must be overcome before dealing with the bandits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set under the 5th edition rule set, this adventure makes for a nice side adventure to a campaign or a quick &amp;quot;one-shot&amp;quot; adventure. This challenge takes place at the end of the harvest season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
