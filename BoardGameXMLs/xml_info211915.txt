			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Aflakl&amp;oacute; the goal is to be the wealthiest player when the market cards deck is depleted. Players roll a die to move around Iceland and depending on the spaces they land on they can buy fish plants, go fishing, draw event cards or sell their catch. Event cards are played immediately, but players also have action cards which can be used when needed, usually to wreck havoc amongst the other players. When players buy fish plants (or land on existing ones) they can go fishing, and then sell their catch later. The price depends on the market cards in the center of the board which are changed when players cross the starting space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Aflakl&amp;oacute; is a revolutionary new Icelandic board game where players compete to expand their fisheries empires by sailing around Iceland, catching and selling fish and taunting each other. On every corner danger is near, in the form of changing government, Norwegian fishermen and Greenpeace. Players have to have steel nerves to withstand the pressures and have a chance to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
