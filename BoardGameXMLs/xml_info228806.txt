			<description>This is a two-player game where one player controls the 32 Peasants and one player controls the Three Guardsmen.  The guardsmen control the castle ( 3 x 3 positions) and the peasants try to gain control of the castle.  They start in the four corners of the board (each corner has 8 positions.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play: Peasants move first and then each player moves alternately.  Peasants move one space at a time and never jump.  Guardsmen may move one space or may jump one peasant, removing it from play. Guardsmen must jump if possible or be removed from play.  Moves can go in any direction, following the lines on the board.  Once in castle, the peasant can not leave.  The guardsmen can move in and out at will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
