							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rebellion Era Infinities Sourcebook</name>
									
			<description>From the Authors' Notes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thor A. Thorson Jr.:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of the tremendous support and encouragement from all who contributed to the Rise of the Empire Infinities Sourcebook and those who have perused this volume, Matt and I are pleased to release the second of hopefully five sourcebooks starting with the events in the previously mentioned sourcebook and then continuing into the Rebellion Era. In addition, we are also happy to include Brian Powell to help with springing ideas off of each other, and we hope that this sourcebook measures up to the content and quality of the previous sourcebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Matthew Norton:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a dark time in the galaxy. The Empire has arisen, the Rebellion is growing, and all out civil war is blossoming. And this is only in the second book! The sequel to our Rise of the Empire Infinities Sourcebook, the Rebellion Era Infinities Sourcebook, has proven to be the most daring book attempted by Thor, Brian and I. Inside is a rich tapestry of galactic life in the galaxy, yet a dark tone hangs over it all. This could not have been accomplished without Brian's and Thor's help. On my Christmas vacation I worked for a week hashing out the timeline, and then we literally examined every line for the next entire month toget the best vision of this dark time to you. And I appreciated Brian's and Thor's help, even if they made me scream on the inside, for they acted as a badly needed counter balance to me. And even though I lost much, much sleep working on this book, I can not be happier with what has been made. You, the Holonet, have been great and I would like to thank all of for your support for our previous book and your support for our current creation. Brian, we butted heads a lot, but you had some of the best ideas in the book. And Thor, thank you again for giving me a place to put my creativity and love for Star Wars into something I am truly honored and humbled to be a part of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brian Powell:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In every story there is a start, a finish, and conflict in between. In the tale of putting this sourcebook together, Thor gave us a start, Matt lead us to an ending, and along the way I created plenty of conflict. My contributions to this sourcebook, came a few months after Thor and Matt begun the timeline, so I was poised to see the story from a position of a first time reader, and with my input, together the three of us made the story better. Many hours spent online in chat sessions we tempered the great work of Thor, and made it better, grittier, and larger in scope. To Thor, I wish to express my gratitude for including me in an expanded role in his grand works. To Matt, I wish to express thanks for truly being a great source of powerful ideas which gave me something to live up to during our creation phase. Also would like to thank the Holonet community for giving each of us a home on the web, where we have been honored to share ideas with and participate in numerous projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
