			<description>The idea is to win a MiniT (=Mini-Tennis) Tie-Break.&lt;br/&gt;The game has 56 position cards, 20 running cards, 32 forehand cards, 32 backhand cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with the usual serve of a normal Tie-Break.&lt;br/&gt;The played cards are put down on the table so that a pattern of cards is being developed into the size of a tennis court  (8 by 5 cards). Player A starts with his serve. Then the players alternate getting 2 serves, starting with player B.&lt;br/&gt;Play continues to 7 points or until a player leads by 2 points once 7 is reached.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
