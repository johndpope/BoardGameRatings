							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Bakerâ€™s Dozen of Post-Apocalyptic Traders</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even after an apocalyptic event, people still need stuff, and when people need stuff, enterprising individuals will set up to sell them it, whether this be physical goods or services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement details thirteen different traders that could be found in a post-apocalyptic setting. Most should be suitable for any setting, as long as there is a reasonably secure place for them to operate from - although one is mobile - but they are generally aimed at settings a few years, or a few decades at most, following a near-future apocalyptic event, rather than many hundreds of years in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample shop:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skinny Pete&amp;rsquo;s Meats: A seller of meats of dubious provenance, all the evidence suggests that Skinny Pete doesn't actually eat his own wares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is cover and one the front matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
