			<description>In G. I. Joe Adventure Board Game!, players take on the roles of the eponymous comic book (and cartoon series) heroes and race around the board attempting to complete as many missions as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are given objective cards to accomplish and start their tasks by wandering the training areas with their heroes, gathering equipment cards to help them in their quests.  Movement is based on dice rolls.  After gathering what they feel is adequate, they set their heroes off towards the locations in the adventure areas stated on their objective cards, expending equipment cards to access secured sites and overcome enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When they reach their destinations, they score the points stated on their objective cards and draw another objective card, starting another cycle of gathering equipment and moving towards the objectives.  The first player to score 100 points wins, ending the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
