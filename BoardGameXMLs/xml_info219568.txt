			<description>Get ready to tell stories like you've never told them before. What's that? Why is this different and just not some marketing ploy? Well, I'll tell you internet friend!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Everything Makes Sense, you'll be telling stories will all your friends, your family, and even your greatest enemies for story glory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games last several rounds or until THE END OF TIME ITSELF. Play until your heart's content. Play for laughs, play to win, play to tell the greatest tale. Play to understand the fundamentals of what it even means to play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We're pretty confident things will make sense, otherwise, that would just be awkward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- How to play -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is simple. Each player draws two cards from the Character, Setting, and Plot decks up to a maximum hand size of (6) cards. Whenever you play a card, draw the same card type, always drawing back up to six cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group selects a Story Stickler (judge) who reads off the Theme card, enforces any rules of that card, weights in on the direction of the story if needed, and most importantly awards the points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player plays up to three cards per theme, playing one between the Beginning, Middle, and End of each story. The Player who goes first has the freedom to set up the story however they like, whereas the player who goes last has the power to really end with a bang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The round ends when all players have played three cards between the Beginning, Middle, and End. The Story Stickler then picks whom the winner is based on whatever they liked from that story. A new Story Stickler is chosen and a new Theme is picked, giving way to a new tale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh! I almost forgot. There's also Plot Twists that can be played anytime to override any card in the story with another card from your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As crazy as stories can get, hopefully... Everything Makes Sense!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
