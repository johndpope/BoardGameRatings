							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tome of Twisted Things</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are proud to present our third product in our Little Red Presents line (first two were Medjay &amp;amp; Fencer)- Tome of Twisted Things!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We try to showcase up and coming designers, giving them a chance to cut their teeth on a book. This time we've got wonderfully twisted classes that blur the lines between good and evil!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Darkborn &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prestige Class &lt;br/&gt;By welcoming demonic energies into their soul, darkborn are a weapon good uses to combat evil in its own home. Using a unique bargaining/betting mechanic darkborn fight back against the darkness at the cost of their own immortal soul. But beware, this path of power is seductive and more than one darkborn has fallen to the power they wield...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Avenger &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paladin Alternate &lt;br/&gt;You are not good nor evil, all you care about is revenge. By making a deal with a god of vengeance, avengers are given the power they need to seek the revenge they so desire but must help others!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Ruiner &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Antipaladin Archetype &lt;br/&gt;Charged with bringing about the destruction of the world, ruiners are not interested in petty things like demons or selfishness. They seek to destroy- plain and simple. They revel in the pain they inflict and serve no lord...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Tyrant &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prestige Class &lt;br/&gt;It is fair to say that all men desire power. Often the world descends into chaos as men squabble and bicker over who deserves power, as each tries to gain more power than the rest. Few are the men who seeks to wield this power with a sense of purpose. The tyrant stands among these privileged few, assured on his right to rule over lesser beings. Whether a despot or duke, benign or barbaric, all tyrants seek to rule over the land and impose their will to end chaos they see around them by whatever means necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Warped &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Race &lt;br/&gt;Born from an unnatural union of humanoid and eidolon, the warped are forever marked by their planar heritage. While it is not as uncommon as some wish for a summoner to be intimate with their eidolon, any children resulting from the union are usually put down if found out. Nearly universally feared or despised by most cultures, the warped tend to see life as a struggle. &lt;br/&gt;Also Included: Bloodborn Warped Summoner, and Monk of the Flowing Form &lt;br/&gt;archetypes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Over 20 New Feats &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Including story feats for evil outsiders seeking redemption, warped racial feats, and metamagic feats!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is great for evil campaigns (like Way of the Wicked, something set in the Underdark, or a game in/from Cheliax if you are doing Golarion ) or even in campaign settings where things are a little darker (Ravenloft and Eberron come to mind).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
