							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sorcerous Lineages</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Just Have to Be Born With It&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone knows that the source of a sorcerer&amp;rsquo;s magic is in his blood. Most sorcerers have arcane lineages that tend to fall into fairly straightforward and easy to define categories. This sorcerer is descended from a dragon, and has a draconic bloodline. That sorcerer is descended from a devil, and has an infernal bloodline. But there are some sorcerous lineages that are unique unto themselves, and which, for various reasons, have developed unique powers, specific to a single family tree. This book is about those arcane ancestries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While a standard sorcerer bloodline gives you mechanical abilities that match a tightly focused theme, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you very much in the way of background and flavor, and their narrow focus approaches a scientific or clinical categorization. By contrast, each of the ten bloodlines in this book has a rich and unique identity, which is not only reflected in their unique bloodline abilities, but also in extensive background sections which detail the origins of the bloodline, as well as providing some insight into what life is like for members of the bloodline, and information on how other sorcerers with that bloodline live and act, not only giving prospective players great starting points for building their character&amp;rsquo;s background and personality, but also offering fully-formed arcane families or organizations that a GM can use to make the game world a more dynamic and interesting place, even if none of his players are interested in sorcerers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever wondered just where your sorcerer got his magic powers, or thought that an arcane aristocracy was a cool idea, or even if you&amp;rsquo;re just looking for a new set of bloodline powers to try or even just something fun to spark your imagination, this is the book for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
