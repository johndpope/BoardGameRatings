			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The edge of the century draws near, as does the life of the great Queen Victoria. In America, the Native tribes have been decimated, and the frontier declared closed. England is beginning to lose her Empire, though for the moment it is safe. In the cities, women shout for the right to vote, workers strike for a living wage, and anarchists gather in secret with Das Capital in one hand and a bomb in another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Europe, ethnic unrest and a complex web of alliances will soon burn the continent in a war many men think will be good. They say that Europe has gone soft and weak and needs a war to make it strong again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And underneath the calm, stoic Victorian facade, madness coils and twists, waiting to erupt. Secret societies meet, calling on spirits of the dead and ancient gods. Curses lay upon families, waiting to drag them down into madness, or worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Okay, I'm out of time. Basically, I'm looking at turn of the 19th/20th century as it would have been seen through the eyes of Edgar Allan Poe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
