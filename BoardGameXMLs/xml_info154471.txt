			<description>Each player gets 4 different meeples of one color: man, woman, letter and luggage. The movements are determined by a special roulette wheel. The goal is to travel from the starting spacees (1-4) to the summer vacation spots (A-D). The 1st player to get all 4 meeples to his vacation spot, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each spinning of the roulette wheel determines the moves of all 4 players (A-D) at once. For the different kind of meeples, there are different rules of how and when they move and what happens, when the meet each other. So for example, the woman can carry a man of any color (this symbolizes them forming a pair) and the letter causes man and woman to step a few spaces back, while they are busy with reading. Some encounters even cause the meeples to get sent back to their home to start anew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game most likely was published in the 1930s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
