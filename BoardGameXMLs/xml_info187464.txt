			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do-Gooders &amp;amp; Daredevils: Gears &amp;amp; Grease Helps Supercharge Your Super-Ride&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This release for the Do-Gooders &amp;amp; Daredevils series presents Gears &amp;amp; Grease, a private company that develops super-vehicles and the weapons and equipment that makes them super. Run by the mutant, Gearhead, and his alien partner, Grease Monkey, this company can provide super-heroes with the means they need to get into battle -- and survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within you will find three new flaws to start off, followed by game stats for the company's two owners and the Gearbox secret facility where all of the vehicular magic takes place. Next, you are provided with over 20 new vehicle features, and an expanded vehicle size category chart that allows you to build vehicles as large as a solar system. If that's not enough for you, more than 20 power build add-ons are also provided, ranging from active camouflage to defensive systems to super-shocks (most of which are scalable by rank), finishing things off with more than a dozen weapon builds, nearly 10 vehicle complications, and 10 stock vehicle templates to get you started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
