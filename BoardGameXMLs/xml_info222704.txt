							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Endiri Incident</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outpost Endiri glimmered in the dark background of the gas giant. The thump from the hull was the cue to get up from the embrace of the travel pod and enter the small space station. As you slip out of the dreamy state induced by the long journey, your mission flashes into your mind with intense clarity: Mining Facility Endiri K32 had lost contact with the Nexus station. The last report was that of a major magnetic storm emitting from the gas giant Endiri. There were eight scientists running the space station and monitoring the automatic mining rigs on the moon Sheridan. The outpost was supposed to be abandoned and only used as a relay station as the mining operations proceeded without problems. But as the signal was lost the company figured that the main antenna was malfunctioning and sent a team of service technicians to solve the problem. That&amp;rsquo;s you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
