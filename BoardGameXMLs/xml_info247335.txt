							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Changelings of Porphyra</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is a Changeling?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Lands of Porphyra campaign setting, a changeling is a humanoid that was raised to believe they were a member of a certain race, only to find out they had been born something else entirely. As infants these beings are abducted, adopted, abandoned, sold, and/or traded, and then changed by magic to resemble a member of a different people. The circumstances of a changeling&amp;rsquo;s existential reassignment are often a complex mystery. This change is not perfect, however, and many changelings grow up wondering why they feel different. This feeling can grow into unforgiving resentment or overwhelming curiosity, depending on the individual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Changelings of Porphyra includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Pink Flower of Saint Zenobie story by Aaron Hollingsworth.&lt;br/&gt;    Changeling racial characteristics for the Lands of Porphyra Campaign Setting.&lt;br/&gt;    Ecology and roleplaying information on this infiltrative race.&lt;br/&gt;    5 race traits and 5 alternate racial characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;    An arcane trickster archetype, a sorcerer bloodline, and a swashbuckler archetype.&lt;br/&gt;    2 pieces of mundance equipment, 3 feats, 3 magic items, and 3 spells.&lt;br/&gt;    Favored class bonuses for a multitude of classes.&lt;br/&gt;    A 1st level changeling bloodrager npc&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
