			<description>Outfoxed! is a fast, fun, quirky card game in which you play as either the foxes, or the elusive birds, in a super epic showdown for survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How To Play&lt;br/&gt;Separate all cards into 3 different color decks. Give the blue to one player, the orange the other. Shuffle the black deck and set it face-down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start, the blue player places 25 bird cards face-up on the playing surface, in any design within an 8x8 grid. This is the &amp;quot;Flock&amp;quot; in which all cards must stay connected (share a side) at all times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The orange player has first turn, and may play 1 fox on top of any bird to eat it, and remove it from play. Next, players take turns drawing 1 card from the black deck, which identifies the number of moves a player may make during a turn. Foxes may only move by pouncing on a bird and taking its place. Birds can fly, and therefore may move to an open place on the invisible 8x8 grid. If a &amp;quot;Plus&amp;quot; card is drawn by the orange player, he or she adds a fox to the game. If drawn by the blue player, he or she adds 3 more birds. During play no move may be taken that separates even one bird from the flock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The orange player wins by eating all birds. The blue player wins by surrounding the fox(es) with 8 birds (on all 4 sides and 4 corners).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
