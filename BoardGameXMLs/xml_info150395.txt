							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sinoca &quot;Sin&quot; Meeku</name>
									
			<description>Free RPG Day 2013 Character for use with Shadows of a Black Sun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sin comes from a long line of bounty hunters and learned many of their ways, even though she did not join in the family business. The Rodian came to Coruscant ten years ago seeking ever larger fortunes and wrestled her way into the property market. What Sin thought was an innocuous deal turned out to involve the Pykes, and they made sure she would profit more if she undercut her original client deeply. In time, Sin came to appreciate the world of crime and what could be accomplished working outside of the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
