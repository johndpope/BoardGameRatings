							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Triominos Turbo</name>
									
			<description>Why Triominos? Because it's like dominoes, but with 3 sides... So it's not dominoes... It's triominos. Got it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why Turbo? This game is against the clock. You have to be quick before time runs out. If that happens, everyone gets punished... including you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So the other players aren't my friends? In your dreams! Everyone wants to win! You have to act quickly and get rid of all your stones before the others... Without getting distracted by the evil timer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
