			<description>A chess variant in which spaces have a card with a picture of a chess piece drawn on it which determines the move of the player's pawns. It is played on a 6 by 6 grid; to start with only the end zones have cards on them, but each turn another (face up from a stack)is placed onto an empty space. Pawns starting from spaces without cards can only move forward or backwards and can't capture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is thus partly about conventional chess and partly about constructing the board to favour yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My copy was sold as a double game with Thataway, with which it shares a board and some pieces; I don't know if it has ever been sold separately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I believe this game was originally sold as Chafts, as early as 1986. David Watts visited Cardiff to trial it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
