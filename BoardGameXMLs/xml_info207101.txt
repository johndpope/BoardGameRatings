			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player group are camped by a small stream on the side of a mountain. Just after dawn they hear the sound of hooves, and a few minutes later the sound of a man cursing and mumbling under his breath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a few minutes more, a short, elderly man appears, riding a pony. He is dressed in fine clothing, wearing a huge but tasteless hat, and is accompanied by one of the biggest men they have ever seen. The man is so big it would seem he couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a horse big enough, so he is walking about three paces behind the pony. He carries a huge mace, which he carries across his shoulders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The man stops by the stream to water his horse and spots the PCs. He looks them over, then begins to smile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
