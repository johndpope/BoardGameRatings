			<description>A bidding game for 2-4+ players in which each player represents a powerful Arab family faction during The Rise of the Caliphate 632 - 750.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in 10 turns with each turn representing one conquest: Arabia, Palestine, Babylonia, Syria, Egypt, Persia, North Africa, Afghanistan, Spain, Sind&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common set of victory tokens and fate points and a single caliph token&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck comprising three card types: Control, Conquest, Culture. Cards have a value of 1, 2 or 3.  There are 4 different types of culture cards: Religion, Science, Art, and Custom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a bidding mat and screen. The screen is used to hide the mat during bidding. The mat is divided into seven spaces (categories) with rewards as indicated: &lt;br/&gt;Control (5 Victory Tokens)&lt;br/&gt;Conquest (4 Victory Tokens &amp;amp; 2 Fate Tokens)&lt;br/&gt;Culture (3 Victory Tokens)&lt;br/&gt;Draw (5 Cards)&lt;br/&gt;Draw (4 Cards)&lt;br/&gt;Draw (3 Cards)&lt;br/&gt;Conversion (2 Victory Tokens &amp;amp; 2 Cards)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start each player is dealt 1 card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The turn is divided into 4 Phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Fate Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Each player gets 10 fate tokens and draws 1 card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  Bid Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Players use their fate tokens to bid, in secret, on the 7 mat spaces. Cards can also be used. Control cards can only be used on the control space, conquest cards on the conquest space and culture cards on the culture space. Each card is worth 1-3 fate tokens. Some Control cards (Caliph cards) can only be used by the current Caliph. Some Control cards (Rebel cards) can only be used by non-Caliph players. &lt;br/&gt;-   When all players are done the screens are lifted and all bids are revealed. &lt;br/&gt;-   Unused Fate Tokens and cards can be saved from turn to turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.  Spoils Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   The player with the most fate points (from tokens &amp;amp; cards) in a space wins that space. The winner of a space is awarded with Victory Tokens and/or cards as indicated. &lt;br/&gt;-  All bid cards and fate tokens used in the bid are discarded. &lt;br/&gt;-  The winner of the control category takes possession of the Caliphate Token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.  End Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Max hand size is 10 cards. Discard excess cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring&lt;br/&gt;-   If you win the conquest category in turn 1 gain 1 extra Victory Token.&lt;br/&gt;-   If you win the conquest category in turn 2 gain 2 extra Victory Tokens&lt;br/&gt;-   If you have the lowest control score during the turn 6 lose 1 Victory Token&lt;br/&gt;-   If you have the lowest control score during the turn 8 lose 2 Victory Tokens&lt;br/&gt;-   If you have the lowest control score during the turn 10 lose 3 Victory Tokens&lt;br/&gt;-   If you have the lowest conquest score during turn 7 or turn 9 lose 3 Victory Tokens. &lt;br/&gt;-   If you play at least 4 different types of culture cards in a single bid, you immediately score 2 Victory Tokens, whether you win the bid or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 10 turns the game ends.  The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
