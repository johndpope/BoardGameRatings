							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Trek Starfleet Game</name>
									
			<description>This was a small promotional game which was distributed by fast-food chain McDonald's. The game is based on the first Star Trek movie. The winner is the first player whose starship reaches the V'GER space at the end of the map. The game pieces are attached to the perforated cardstock map. Once detached, these fold into four stand-up starships and a hexagonal shaped tube which serves as the die. Portions of the map also fold up to give decorative parts of the map a 3-D look.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
