			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creatures Cold and Cruel! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Monsters: Slavic brings you an amazing and exciting assortment of monsters from the fens, fields, forests, and rivers of Eastern Europe, from the Balkan south to the Russian north and all points in between. Drawn from a variety of cultures and traditions, even a few from the neighboring Baltic lore of Finland and Germany, these creatures range from CR 1 to 21 and range from mild and almost benevolent spirits of home and hearth to dreadful doombringers of titanic size and terrifying evil. The kindly kikimora might tend house and home from her humble hidey-hole, but her irascible temper can make her unpredictable at best, much like the wise but wily vodyanoi, just as likely to bargain and banter as to drown and devour anyone that displeases them, or even trap their soul for all eternity. A triumvirate of humble house spirits guard and tend the home fires, including the hot-tempered ovinnik, the industrious domovoi, and the garden guardian dvorovoi. The Slavic spirits of nature are beautiful and terrible in turn, from the graceful air veela and their delightful dance of death to the metamorphic and misty etiainen and the seductive rusalka trapped just beneath the water's surface, all too eager to add another conquest to their boudoir of bodies. These beasts of the east can be vicious like the hungry vukodlak or the cunning bagiennik, with savage serpents from the venomous tiny tatzlwyrm to the titanic three-headed gorynych. As if a dozen existing monsters were not enough, the brand-new stalimedved is an ironclad dreadnought, a mighty mystic bear perverted through foul enchantments into a steel-shod engine of destruction. In addition to the featured creatures, we bring you a delightful short story in traditional form, the fable of The Bear with Steel Fur!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
