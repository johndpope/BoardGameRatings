							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Careless Heroes</name>
									
			<description>Also nicknamed 'Fashion Fighters', and based on the popular Gaki no Tsukai series, this card game replicates one of their most famous challenges:  Can five heroes (or more!) transform into their super costumes while not caring to recall which hero they actually are?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You take on the role of 5 &amp;quot;Powered&amp;quot; Ranger style heroes in 5 unique colors: Red Ranger, Blue Ranger, Green Ranger, Gold Ranger, and Pink Ranger.  Yet, you are all careless, and always forget which ones you are. Also, NO table talking is allowed because you are also too proud to call each other to ask.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to show up to the battle in a unique Ranger suit, matching no other Ranger's color.  Matching another ranger simply will not do, and you will refuse to fight and just go home.  It's embarrassing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic rules: Players have 5 cards each in their starting hands: one card for each of the 5 costume colors (add more colored cards for more players than 5).  Choose a starting player (a lead Ranger) and everyone secretly picks a color costume to wear and puts that matching color card face down in front of them.  Starting with the leader and going clockwise, you will flip your card face up in front of you and yell &amp;quot;[Insert color you played] RANGER GO!&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If all the colors are different, you fight the threat and save the day.  If not, you take any non matching cards into your hand or discard any colors that matched another player (place the discarded card in front of you, face up, so everyone can see what color you lost).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You refuse to ever experience that humiliation again and throw the costume out.  If the same color card is lost by all players, the game is impossible to win, and you instantly lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lastly, (this can be a variant or base rule, your choice) a Ranger will never show up in the same costume twice in a row, so for the following round you must pick a different color to play (eg., yellow, yellow, blue is not allowed, but yellow, blue, yellow is).  Players need to use deduction and pay attention to what costumes are out of play to come out on top!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
