			<description>A new game from the makers of Booleo, this time covering organic Chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CHem-eO is a fun card game for two or more players, which demonstrates basic organic chemistry fundamentals. Players compete to build complex and simple compounds from individual atoms.  Points are scored upon completing each molecule.  Players may choose to play to any score they wish - a suggested goal is 92, which is the atomic number of Uranium (the heaviest naturally occurring element).  If the player would like a longer game then an alternate goal could be the atomic number of the heaviest element currently discovered.  Players scores are kept on the periodic table of element.  Play as Carbon(Solid), Oxygen(liquid), Helium(Gas), or Nitrogen(Unknown).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The points scored as players finish building compounds come in two varieties: simple and complex.  Simple compounds are common compounds which are made up of relatively few atoms.  Complex compound are designated as such; either because they consist of more atoms and bonds, or because they are less well known. Complex compounds have the added difficulty of requiring the recipe card to complete.  This also earns the player bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a compound is started it can be completed by any player which means a compound you start out to be Methane (a simple compound) may be turned into Acetic Acid (a complex compound) requiring a recipe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards include single, double and triple bonds, elements, and recipes for compounds.  Play is fast paced and allows the players to learn about organic chemistry while they play this fun interactive game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
