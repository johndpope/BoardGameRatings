							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">4:20 The Boardgame</name>
									
			<description>4:20 is a dice rolling game for 1 to 4 players. The aim of the game is to roll as many joints from your boss&amp;rsquo;s stash as possible.&lt;br/&gt;But what fun is that unless you get to dabble in the goods?&lt;br/&gt;By the time the clock hits 4:20am the player with the most J&amp;rsquo;s is declared King of Toke!&lt;br/&gt;Just make sure you stay awake! Take too many puffs and risk &amp;lsquo;greening out&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br/&gt;Move around the apartment, gather Joints, feed the munchies by raiding the refrigerator,&lt;br/&gt;session up in the living room, or strip down and jump in the hot tub. The night is yours!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup:&lt;br/&gt;Place the Board in the middle of the table. Place the time marker on the 4:20pm square of the time track.&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the Kitchen, living room, Hot Tub and Bedroom card decks and place each deck beside the corresponding room on the board.&lt;br/&gt;Place the Joint tokens beside the board in reach of everyone.&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a character and takes the corresponding player board and avatar.&lt;br/&gt;The person who&amp;rsquo;s the biggest stoner starts. If you can&amp;rsquo;t decide who that is &amp;ndash; play rock paper scissors to decide.&lt;br/&gt;The Starting player places there character on any room in the house (except the bathroom). In clockwise order each player places their character in any empty room they choose (once again, not the bathroom). Only one player can be in any room at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Play&lt;br/&gt;The starting player takes the 5 dice and rolls them all. They can then put aside any die they wish to keep (this is called &amp;ldquo;locking&amp;rdquo;). The player has 2 rerolls (unless stated otherwise like in &amp;ldquo;The Bedroom&amp;rdquo;) so can roll the dice 3 times in total per turn. After your rerolls you apply your results.&lt;br/&gt;Each Turn Consists of&lt;br/&gt;Resolve room power on board if it states &amp;ldquo;Start of Turn&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Roll all Dice. Put aside any dice you wish to keep (All clock dice are automatically &amp;ldquo;locked&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; see below)&lt;br/&gt;Reroll (this is optional) any dice up to 2 times except &amp;ldquo;locked&amp;rdquo; dice. They must be put aside.&lt;br/&gt;Resolve dice (see below for results and order)&lt;br/&gt; The Dice Results are as follows&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    J = Take one J token (1 per J)&lt;br/&gt;    M = Move. You must move to another location in the apartment. If it is occupied by another player they must move to your location as only one player per room is allowed. If 2 M&amp;rsquo;s are rolled you do not move and must take a card from the room deck you are in. If 3 M&amp;rsquo;s are rolled and you have no rerolls left you must move to the bathroom square. Your turn is over and disregard any other dice results except clock rolls. (do not collect J&amp;rsquo;s or dish out puffs)&lt;br/&gt;    C= Clock. Time passes and for every C rolled the time marker moves one square up. Every C rolled is instantly &amp;ldquo;locked&amp;rdquo;. You cannot reroll any C results (unless a card states otherwise).&lt;br/&gt;    P= Puff. All other players take a puff and must move their awake marker up one square on their player boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Order in a turn&lt;br/&gt;When applying results, do so in the following order.&lt;br/&gt;1               IF you have 3 &amp;ldquo;M&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; Proceed directly to bathroom , Ignore all other dice except clocks this turn. Advance clock if applicable and your turn ends.&lt;br/&gt;2               Take all J&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br/&gt;3               Everyone else takes Puffs&lt;br/&gt;4               Move or take room card and resolve (if applicable)&lt;br/&gt;5               Advance clock&lt;br/&gt;6               End your turn. Pass dice to player on your left&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Bathroom:&lt;br/&gt;Nature called and you had to go to the bathroom. Damn, the locks broken.. How the hell do you get out you ask?! Getting stuck in the bathroom is no fun at all.&lt;br/&gt;As soon as you enter the bathroom lose 5 J&amp;rsquo;s (they fell in!)&lt;br/&gt;Roll dice as usual but.....Bathroom rolls are a bit different&lt;br/&gt;No&amp;rdquo; J&amp;rdquo; results count when rolling dice, you can still make the others take puffs and the clock still ticks on as normal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escaping the Bathroom:&lt;br/&gt;The only way out of the bathroom space (unless you have a card)  is by rolling and &amp;ldquo;locking&amp;rdquo; 2 &amp;ldquo;M&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo;. You must then go to any empty room in the house and play on as normal. If you have any rerolls left this turn you may continue to roll unlocked dice. Resolve dice normally at the end of your turn (ignoring the 2 &amp;ldquo;M&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; used to escape the bathroom).&lt;br/&gt; Time / Awake Tracks / Game End&lt;br/&gt;If any players awake track hits &amp;ldquo;white out&amp;rdquo; that player has fallen asleep and is out of the game. If all other players fall asleep the last player awake is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;As soon as the time track hits 4:20am the game is over. All awake players add up their J&amp;rsquo;s and the stoner with the most wins! If that is also tied the most awake stoner wins....&lt;br/&gt;If both J&amp;rsquo;s and Awake are tied..... geeeze?!?  Play again!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
