			<description>From the shadows of the eastern lands, the young Kitsune Momiji&lt;br/&gt;has come to serve Samael and the Fallen Angels as one of the top&lt;br/&gt;spies of the organization. Trained as a perfect ninja from the moment she was just a cub, she combines her natural fox magic with the deadliest assassin&amp;rsquo;s arts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Samael Prowler - Lv. 45&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At 5 | Dm 3 | Df 9 | Ar 0 | LP: 12 | Re 10 | Mo 12/16 | AP 3/4&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;oo - Stealth (Subterfuge, Effect)&lt;br/&gt;Momiji becomes Hidden.
