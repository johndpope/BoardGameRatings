			<description>From the box: The entire family will enjoy this exciting, easy-to-learn game.  Using simple addition and subtraction, players get rid of their cards and score points by making the running total reach zero or 13.  Bonus points go to the player who uses one of the Lucky 13 cards to 'take the trick'.  With strategy, quick thinking, and a little luck, you can be the first player to score 500 points and win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck is composed of positively- and negatively-numbered cards, and the point of the game is to go out first, like Rummy.  Lucky 13 is not quite a set collection game, and it's primarily geared for family gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
