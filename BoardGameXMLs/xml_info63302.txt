							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Script Crypt Volume 2: Four Damned Scripts</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Damned If You Do, Damned If You Don't&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here they are, Horror Rules fans - four brand new adventure Scripts for you favorite little five-star horror-comedy RPG!  The four Damned Scripts in this Damned book represent a fiendish collection of Damned tales dealing with the powers of ultimate Damned evil. All the Bad Guys in this supplement are of the &amp;quot;really really bad&amp;quot; variety (aka &amp;quot;Damned&amp;quot;): black-hearted demons, giant evil demi-gods, malevolent spirits and other soulless abominations from the pit of Hell. The good news is... well, there really isn't any good news. Players will have to face these creeps head on and probably will have a hell of a time with them. Of course, they will have the benefit of knowing that their efforts (might) make the world a better place and that they're (hopefully) striking a blow for everything good and decent (this will be good to remember when the screaming starts). So if you've ever really wanted to look true evil in the eye and then spit in it and then shoot it with a shotgun, this book is for you. Satan ain't a-waitin' - grab your cross and give him the spankin' he truly deserves! (A little prayer is also highly appropriate.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four Complete Adventures!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Script is a complete adventure, including all the classic Horror Rules elements: Story, Bad Guys, Cast, Walk-Ons, Chain of Events... even Mood tips and Plot Pushers! Also, with expanded Sequel Suggestions and Plot Twists, each gripping and terrifying Script becomes four Scripts - that's 16 times the mayhem!  Packed with all the wacky scares, edge-of-your-seat action and pee-your-pants thrills you've come to love, Four Damned Scripts is a sure hit and a must-have supplement for horror enthusiasts and gaming fans alike.  So buy this book and play your heart out... before some dirty hood-wearing cultist tries to cut it out and serve it up to the Dark One with his afternoon tea...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
