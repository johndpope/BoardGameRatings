			<description>Description of the game from Spielbox:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crossroad is a card game originally developed for those involved in emergency planning, but is now also being widely released in Japan. The game is supposed to teach what can happen to the Japanese in the event of a catastrophic earthquake as well as what to do in such an event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is for 5 to 7 players, and the number of players should be uneven if possible. At the start of the game, each player has the same number of 10 episode cards in hand. He also has a Yes card and a No card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the players begins and reads the text from one of this episode cards. Then, the players try to guess how the majority of the players would act in the situation described. They choose either their Yes or No card, laying it face-down on the table in front of themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player that chose the majority answer gets a point. These are represented by blue Zabutons (traditional Japanese pillows). The pillows have a symbolic meaning for many Japanese. Traditionally, Japanese comedians sit on blue zabutons during their performance, and they are sometimes given to others whose opinions are given the utmost respect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But here Crossroad doesn't end - because it is highly honored when a player is alone in his opinion and manages to defend his position well. Here, a golden zabuton is awarded...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toshiko Kikkawa is an organizational psychologist and professor at Keio University in Tokyo Katsuya Yamori is a social psychologist and professor at Kyoto University Tsuyoshi Ajiro is a freelance game designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
