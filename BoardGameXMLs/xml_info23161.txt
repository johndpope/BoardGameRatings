			<description>You are the leader of a large caravan, traveling the ancient trade routes between majestic cities across the Near East.  You have collected your local goods for trade with the strange peoples encountered in your travels.  Distrust and language barriers are obstacles, but the need to exchange wares is great.  You leave your goods at the designated point, and your partners do the same.  After many adjustments, your strange partners pack up your goods and leave: the trade is successful!  You head home, your camels heavy under the burden of your find.  Soon you will corner the local markets and reap huge profits, not to mention the prestige of being recognized as a master trader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players acquire goods by visiting foreign towns and trading with the other players, trying to acquire sets to sell in their home town.  The player who amasses the greatest wealth by the end of the game is the winner  but don't ignore the prestige you gain from building your reputation as a master trader!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
