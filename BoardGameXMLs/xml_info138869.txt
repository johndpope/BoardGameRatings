			<description>Lead your people to greatness by training them in the ways of war, commerce, magic, labor, or entertainment in this fun and original deck building board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The people in the Empires of Zidal require your guidance!  Train the children in your empire to become military workers who can attack other players and take their game resources.  Alternatively you can train your children to become market workers who can manipulate the in game supply and demand driven market to your advantage.  Grow the power of your empire by constructing buildings to give benefits to workers in specific employment branches.  In total, there are 5 different employment branches which children can be trained in (military, market, magic, labor, or entertainment).  Each branch has their own unique effects and strategies for winning.  In the end whichever empire is able to gain the most signets wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Empires of Zidal is a deck building game for 2 to 4 players.  The game is set in the land of Zidal and every player is the ruler of one of Zidal's empires.  The deck you build throughout the game consists of people from within your own empire.  Will you decide to create a military empire and populate your realm with generals, knights, and archers?  Will you take advantage of the market by training your children to be merchants, negotiators, and analysts?  Will you populate your empire with magic, labor, or entertainment workers... or a combination of two or more employment branches?  It's up to you to decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
