			<description>&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Virtual Boy Wario Land (バーチャルボーイワリオランド　アワゾンの秘宝, Bācharu Bōi Wario Rando Awazon no Hihō, lit. Virtual Boy Wario Land: Secret Treasure of the Awazon), was released by Nintendo for its ill-fated Virtual Boy system in 1995. It stars Wario in a platforming adventure quite similar to most of his other starring roles. The story begins when he wakes up from a nap in the jungle and sees a group of masked monsters. He tracks them to a cave behind a waterfall and discovers a huge treasure. When Wario attempts to take the treasure, a trap is sprung, and he plummets into a huge underground labyrinth. It's up to the player to help Wario escape, while grabbing as much treasure as he can get his hands on. VB Wario Land is generally considered as one of the better games for the Virtual Boy, if not the best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was originally meant to have the name &amp;quot;Wario Cruise&amp;quot;, and the name appeared on the Virtual Boy system's box and in Nintendo Power magazine. The name was changed very shortly before its release.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Virtual_Boy_Wario_Land,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
