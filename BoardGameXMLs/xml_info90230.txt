							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Salamandaar Lite</name>
									
			<description>Salmandaar Lite is a semi-coop game for 1-6 players wherein the players spawn armies from castles located at the points of a hexagonal island and try to withstand the invasion of Fire Salamanders pouring forth from the volcano in the center of the island. The island and counters are all contained in the PDF that will be submitted to the file section, as will the instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player units represent workers, resources and military, and can be spent in attack, to build roads, or to support the generation of more units by providing infrastructure at the player's home castle. Players are expected to generally cooperate in repelling the Fire Salamander invasion, but player combat is possible and might be necessary to defend your castle from players fleeing Salamander overruns of their own lands. Combat with both the invaders and other players is by mutual removal, representing the consumption of both forces and materials and wealth, or will dice rolls, which might result in removal of the enemy without loss of the player unit, or might result in defeat and removal of the attacking unit. Both players and the invading Salamanders will start spawning from any captured castles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paper unit markers are provided, and are color-blindness friendly, but wooden cubes of assorted colors would be a great substitute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of every round (after the last player takes a turn), advance a marker on the turn track. Game ends after ten rounds, or if all players are eliminated.  Winner is the player with the most castles and armies afield at game end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a PnP version of a game still in development, Salamandaar (sans Lite,) for the One Sheet PnP contest. The PnP version is a fixed map, though I will provide additional maps.  The final non-lite version of the game will feature a fixed intro map over which random map tiles may be placed, or placed according to scenario.  The non-lite version will feature a larger map as well, and some more robust player abilities, some more ways to spend units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variant:  Add a seventh player, who runs the Salamanders, ignoring the target priority rules and moving as he/she wishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
