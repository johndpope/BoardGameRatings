			<description>Although this may sound like a didactic game, in fact it appears to be a fairly reasonable attempt at a simple deductive card game (albeit with a moralistic flavor).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary equipment is a deck of cards in four suits - Swords (weapons, military bases, etc.), Plowshares (peaceful projects), Manpower, and Cogwheels (infrastructure, more or less).  Each suit has cards numbered 1-6, four copies of each.  There are also four Inspection cards, one for each player, and a Warmonger card.  The Swords and Warmonger are distributed at the start of each hand - whoever gets the Warmonger card plays differently from everyone else.  Peaceful players disarm (discard face-down) Swords cards and build sets of Plowshares, Manpower, and Cogwheels, while the Warmonger secretly &amp;quot;disarms&amp;quot; Plowshares and other non-Swords cards and builds using Swords instead of Plowshares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are awarded for building sets and for successfully deducing who the Warmonger is (the Warmonger gets points if no one figures this out).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
