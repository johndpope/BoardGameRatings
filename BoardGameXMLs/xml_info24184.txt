			<description>Ka-Nexus is a fast-paced, easy to learn card game for two to four players.  It contains a mix of skill, strategy, and chance.  The goal of the game is to score 21 points over the course of two or more hands, each hand taking about 15 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck consists of 61 cards, fifteen cards (numbered 1-12, Queen, Pharoah, Camel) each in four suits (Scarabs, Fortune, Markets, Thieves) plus the Royal Camel (a Joker of sorts).  The game board has locations for each player to store cards, an area to build the card pyramids central to game play, a draw pile area (the Oasis) and a discard pile area (the Sphinx).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins by taking 25 cards and using them to build two overlapping pyramids in the center of the game board.  The remaining 36 cards are placed in the Oasis.  Each player's turn consists of drawing a card from the Oasis and then making as many &amp;quot;tricks&amp;quot; as possible, where a &amp;quot;trick&amp;quot; is defined as a combination of two cards that add up to 15 or a lone Camel (similar to the classic Pyramid Solitaire game).  Cards for &amp;quot;tricks&amp;quot; may come from the player's personal storage area (which may hold up to 3 cards), the top of the Sphinx pile, or uncovered cards in the pyramid structure.  A player's turn ends when he takes the drawn card and either makes a trick with it, places it in storage, discards it to the Sphinx, or exchanges it with a card already in storage and discards that card to the Sphinx.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all of the cards from the Oasis have been drawn and played, the hand ends and players score points for: the Last Royal Trick (last trick played that contains a Queen, Pharaoh, or Camel) for 1 point, Pyramids (clearing the last card from the pyramids) for i point, Majority (most tricks captured) for 2 points, Scarabs (most Scarab suit cards captured) for 2 points, and Camels at 1 point per captured Camel.  Players are penalized for cards remaining in their storage area at the end of a hand.  Maximum score per hand is 11 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
