			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a standard RPGA Network tournament for a team of up to six 3rd-level agents (though the serial&amp;rsquo;s challenges and XP rewards are tiered so that the serial can be played by up to six agents of levels 8, 13, or 18 as well).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is growing disquiet within government and security circles about the number of military-grade weapons finding their way into terrorist hands. Recent intelligence suggests that two individuals control a large proportion of this trade &amp;mdash; an international arms dealer named Terrance Adams and a shady figure by the name of Lothario Lex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adams is well known within the arms trade, and ostensibly lives on the right side of the law, observing government restrictions and selling only to buyers with recognized &amp;ldquo;enduser certificates.&amp;quot; He lives a playboy lifestyle in Australia, spending freely on his main passion &amp;mdash; horse racing. When not at the races, Adams is usually to be found on his outback ranch, where he conducts most of his business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
