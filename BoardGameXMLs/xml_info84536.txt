			<description>Home Alone 2: Lost In New York is a video game based on the 1992 movie Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, it was released on the NES, Sega Genesis, Game Boy, MS-DOS and Super NES  systems. Though it is based on the movie in terms of plotline and additional dialogue, the game was different from the movie. The NES port uses sound effects from the early 1990's Simpsons games; Bart vs. the Space Mutants for example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Certain changes made the game more interesting in an interactive game than in a static movie, such as use of different weapons and power-ups for protection, level layouts with enemies not seen in the movie, and for the Uncle's House level, usage of hidden keys and locked doors gained only after luring Marv or Harry into specific traps laid out in the various rooms (aka the first two Home Alone movies), as well as an active scene involving the Bird Woman and her birdseed attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Super NES version, while boasting a soundtrack with the Super NES traditionally realistic sounding instrument synth, suffered due to slightly post-8-bit graphics and sound effects, as well as a disjointed feel of incontinuity between stages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NES version has four different levels, the first of which is the Plaza Hotel. Kevin races through various floors and rooms collecting power-ups and avoiding the hotel staff, crazy guests and runaway vacuum cleaners and suitcases. Before he can escape, however, he has to deal with two bosses: the ever-persistent House Detective and the Master Chef. The next level takes place in Central Park, and is similar to the Plaza Hotel: Kevin collects his goodies while avoiding rats, bats and assorted thugs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third level takes place in Kevin's uncle's three-story Townhouse. This time Kevin has to avoid Harry and Marv, and sets up several booby-traps to keep the Wet, er, Sticky Bandits at bay. While doing so, Kevin must also find keys that will allow him to escape to the next floor, and ultimately the Rooftop. Once he's on the roof, Kevin escapes to the streets of New York with the Bandits hot on his tail, until he reaches the giant Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center. It's here where he gets help from the Pigeon Lady to defeat Harry and Marv, have them sent to jail, and finally reunites with his family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reception&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has had very low critical reception. Most reviewers complain that various elements of the game change depending on what part of a level the player is on; for example, the slide attack is an effective move on one part of the level, but does not work on another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York was awarded Worst Sequel of 1992 by Electronic Gaming Monthly. They also awarded it Worst Movie-to-Game of 1996.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
