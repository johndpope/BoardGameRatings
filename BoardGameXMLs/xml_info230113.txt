			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WELCOME TO THE CITY OF SPIRITS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Meriquai Falls, where Native American culture blends seemlessly with modern contemporary society to form one of the most beautiful cities in the United States. It is also home to one of the largest concentrations of metahuman activity in the Midwest. Between the schemes of Galvakar and his Imperions and the genocidal plots of the Manitou and his Totems of Retribution, the crazed antics of the Pooka King and the dark secrets of the Night Sparrow, there is plenty to do for an intrepid hero in Meriquai Falls. Save the city and perhaps, in so doing, save the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MEET VIXEN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting as a young teen from an alternate future, Vixen has worked tirelessly to ensure that her future is not Meriquai Falls' future. Growing up in the shadows of heroes, Vixen has risen to the challenge to become one of Meriquai Falls' most beloved and faithful heroes. Her good looks and dextrous moves probably don't hurt, either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meriquai Falls - Vixen includes HERO System 6th Edition stats for the hero Vixen, her villainous Alpha Horde counterpart Flipside, and the villain The Crown Prince. Also included are discussions about characters in the Alpha Horde universe, and the events during the dark years following the Fall From Grace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
