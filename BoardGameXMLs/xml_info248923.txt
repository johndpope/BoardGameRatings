			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Outer Dark is a plane beyond the ken of mortals - a sea of nothingness through which creatures of nightmare swim. It is home to massive horrors of aberrant biology, whose alien minds defy understanding, sowing madness in those who even attempt to understand them. Where the essence of the Outer Dark touch other planes, realty breaks apart and aberrations spawn. These creatures are the merest shadow of the Outer Dark&amp;rsquo;s denizens and give a glimpse at what those beings may resemble. The truth is, of course, far, far worse. The Outer Dark is outside the bounds of reality. Some learned sages dedicate themselves to understanding the Outer Dark, hoping to be able to track the places where beings from beyond draw close - and watch them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is designed for a group of four to five 7th level characters. It is designed to fit into any Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons world with only a slight adjustment to cosmology. It&amp;rsquo;s most appropriate for games that involve high magic but could be fit into any game where fantastic elements fit. It involves five medium to hard encounters and could be played through in 4-6 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
