			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As space engineers, you have the knowledge and skills you need to maintain your hyper-complex star ship. The rest of the crew are completely reliant on you and your brain. And you are completely reliant on the technology around you. Simple tasks were automated centuries ago, and only enthusiasts and hobbyists retain this archaic knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only that, but the ship is so complex that no one person can comprehend the intricacies of maintenance, repair, and even communicating the concepts at work. The other engineers you work with find everything you say as confusing as the things they say to you. Each niche area of knowledge is unique and vital, and you will need to work together to fill in the missing gaps in your data. Like a tag team of trained dentists, all working on the same tooth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
