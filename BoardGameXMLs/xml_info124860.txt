							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Virxle Crackdown</name>
									
			<description>Dastardly Virxles have invaded the mainframe and are running amuck.  You, as a system administrator, must load your program into a detonation node and set off chain reactions, scoring points for how many you get.  The chaining system can lead to massive scores and ultimate victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, players select which Virxle (color) they are going after and set up an initial board.  Then, on their turn, they can play a card (Special Program or Circuit Card), load a program (placing a token on a detonation node), or run a program (setting off the program and scoring Virxles in your path).  Circuit Cards contain Virxles and detonation points, which players put down, building the board as they play. When running a program, the detonation node has a set distance (in one of the cardinal directions) the explosion travels.  If it can reach another detonation point, a chain begins and can continue for up to 9 detonations points.  Bonus points are scored for longer chains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More advanced rules variants introduce Virxles the player must avoid as they become negative points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
