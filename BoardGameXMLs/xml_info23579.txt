			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        UNAUTHORIZED PRODUCTION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         The information that BGG has on this item indicates that Narrow is a non-authorized version of Octiles.  According to game designer Dale Walton, Yi Qi Intellectual Toys does not have license to produce this game, thus it is set apart from the official entry of Octiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Dale Walton:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Octiles is a US registered trademark for my game. I own the trademark and have licensed this to Kadon Enterprises and Pin International. Listing Yi Qi Intellectual Toys as a publisher is damaging to the trademark, as it implies their game is from me, and would inevitably lead to damage to the value of the mark, and to my returns on invention of the game. For now they may be listed as the source only of Narrow - possibly in the same field that contains that game name, e.g. &amp;quot;Narrow from Yi Qi Intellectual Toys&amp;quot;. Since I have not read their actual rules, I cannot say whether that game is an illegal copy/translation of mine, or a distinct game that belongs on a separate page. The board however is clearly designed to mislead in order to benefit from my design and my mark, and thus, if left on the site on whatever page, the pictures should be annotated as 'Unauthorised copy product, as identified by the author of Octiles'&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
