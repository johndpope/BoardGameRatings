			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gypsy Knights Games is proud to present the second entry in our newest line of products dedicated to the starships of Clement Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vulkan-class is a power projecting attack boat tender capable of carrying twelve deadly attack boats which the elite pilots of the Hub Federation Navy strive to command!  Can you join their ranks?  Can you handle it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vulkan and her dangerous squadrons of attack boats can make an ideal ship for adventure!  Vulkan can be used as the basis of an ongoing naval campaign, as the rescuing &amp;quot;cavalry&amp;quot; for characters in trouble, or as a fearsome adversary for your party of pirates!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships of Clement Sector 2: Vulkan comes complete with beautiful views of the ship and her brood of attack craft including the furious Fast Attack Boat, the deadly Torpedo Attack Boat and the stealthy ASRAC.  Each are shown with full deckplans and statistics to make your use of our product simple, easy, and fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships of Clement Sector 2: Vulkan also features deckplans for the ship's launch as well as several NPCs and a wealth of adventure hooks!  Though designed specifically with our Clement Sector setting in mind, the Vulkan could easily be used in any Traveller setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also includes three versions of our Hub Federation Navy recruiting poster by artists Ian Stead and Bradley Warnes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get on board!  Adventure awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
