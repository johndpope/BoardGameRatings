			<description>This is Truly a 4 player chess game that works and is fun to play! It can be played in 2, 3 or 4 player mode.  With 2 or 4 players you play with 4 sets of pieces and the pieces opposite to each other are partners or teams. The object is to checkmate the other team Kings... so you need 2 checkmates to win ... or a checkmate and a stalemate to win! The Beauty of this game is when your team first gets checkmated you don't lose all that players pieces! Depending on what configuration everyone agreed on at the start of the game determines what pieces are removed when a checkmate occurs. So everybody stays in the game.... right to the end! Piece movement is the same as traditional 2 player chess... with just a few variations that are easy to learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
