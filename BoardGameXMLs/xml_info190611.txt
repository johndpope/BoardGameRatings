			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two versions of the basic character sheet for Kalarsys were provided.  One, the most basic, was offered in a GIF graphic format for full-page printing.  The second was offered as a more-traditional PDF file; this version featured more options for the evolving system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A non-player character generator was provided for Kalarsys.  This software would randomly generate statistics.  It was released as &amp;quot;Version 3&amp;quot; for Unix or DOS; &amp;quot;Version 4&amp;quot; for DOS; and &amp;quot;Version 5&amp;quot; for DOS, with source code.  A &amp;quot;Version 6&amp;quot; was developed but (apparently) not released.  The generator offered several methods of customization though, reportedly, most did not function as anticipated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Kalarsys Dice Roller, or KDice, program was released as a &amp;quot;Version 0.1&amp;quot; for DOS and a &amp;quot;Version 2&amp;quot; for DOS, with source code.  For some time the dice roller was also available via a web browser.  It was functional, but basic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
