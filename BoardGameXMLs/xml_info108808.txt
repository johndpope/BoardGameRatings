			<description>Buchstabengitter is a word-searching game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with 160 different word search puzzles, like the ones that appear in the newspaper. However, players will search for words simultaneously. Each round, a die is rolled, which indicates how many words must be found. Then, that number of cards is drawn; there is a word on each card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, the players have to search for the words in the puzzle and mark them on their sheet. The round ends when a player has found all the words. Then, each player gains one point for each word found. The player that has gained the most points after four rounds wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The puzzles do not only contain each German word, but also the English translation, which makes it possible to use this game to learn English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
