			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 19th Century was the grand time of Empire. New lands could be annexed by working class soldiers ever eager to find a King&amp;rsquo;s ransom in loot. The sons of the middle-class could hope for a better life in Colonial service and the younger sons of ancient families could earn themselves a name and perhaps even lands of their own.  These quests would take them across the worlds, exploring jungles and wastelands unknown to &amp;quot;civilised Man&amp;quot;. Of course the people living in these foreign, &amp;quot;unexplored&amp;quot; lands might rightly be said to have a different view of these adventurers, merchants and empire builders suddenly turning up on their doorsteps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nevertheless, before science-fiction the prime adventure genre was the fiction of empire, full of men who patronised the natives as a class but who treasured the friendship of individuals; dissolute Europeans or crafty viziers for villains; lost cities, bandit tribes and the sort of place where a stiff-upper lip and the ability to ride well were damn near all a gentleman needed and, unless a plucky adventuress or a native princess taking pity on an imprisoned chap, women were hardly seen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
