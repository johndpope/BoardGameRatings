			<description>Full name - &amp;quot;Safety Net: A Technological Security Simulation&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Safety Net is an educational simulation in the form of a single-player card game pitting the player, armed with one deck of cards, against the opposing deck itself. Created as a graduate project for an intelligence analysis program, Safety Net is designed to simulate various online defenses, threats and responses for an individual in an environment with sensitive information. Each card also includes flavor text describing the relevant threat or defensive option. This offers a great way to quickly introduce someone to the basic ups and downs of online security in a sensitive-information-based environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player begins with 10 Security Points (SP) and attempts to use the Defense Deck to build multi-layered defenses across various electronic fronts (email, social media, and mobile devices), while each turn the 'Hacker' deck generates attempts to penetrate or disrupt the player's security, reducing the SP total. If at any point, the SP value reaches zero, the player loses the game. The player wins by successfully fending off the hacker's attacks and surviving ten rounds of the game with SP remaining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
