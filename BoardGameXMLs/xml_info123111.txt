							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Huckleberry Hound Roll-A-Ball</name>
									
			<description>Action game. The board is three dimensional and involves chutes to take a ball from one chute to another. A ball is dropped in the top and will work itself down to the bottom where, hopefully, it will score points depending in which hole it eventually settles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems to me that there is very little skill in this. You cannot decide to throw it down the chutes with gusto, nor can you try to make it a very gentle roll. The different direction chutes take out any influence a player might have, and the end result is purely a matter of chance. Children will enjoy it though, at least until the novelty wears off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box has this slogan....&lt;br/&gt;'Roll - a - ball&lt;br/&gt;Down - a - hill&lt;br/&gt;Try your luck&lt;br/&gt;Test your skill'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
