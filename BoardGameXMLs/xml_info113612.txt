			<description>Maria, or the Puppet Master as she is known to many, is the most frightening of all the Church&amp;rsquo;s agents, with the possible exception of the Bearer. With her amazing ability to control the remains of Memitim, she turns the forces of darkness in on themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Church Warrior/Mystic - Lv. 60&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At 5/7 | Dm 6/8 | Df 8 | Ar 5 | LP 25 | Re 10 | Mo 8/12 | AP 3/4&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innate Abilities: Damage Resistance, Immunity (Doom) .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death Incarnate: Maria gets +3 Attack when making an attack against an enemy unit with 5 LP or lower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soulhunter: Choose an enemy unit at the beginning of the game. Maria uses her second Attack and Damage attribute when making any attack against the chosen unit. If Maria destroys the chosen unit she recovers 15 LP and you may choose a new target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death Puppets: If Maria destroys an enemy unit, that unit isn`t remove from play as normal. Instead, the destroyed unit returns to play under your control. The unit returns as it was before it was destroyed (Actions points, states, etc) However, if the unit takes damage for any reason, it is removed from play. If a Character that was destroyed by this ability is still alive at the end of the game, it is considered a causality for the original player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ooo - Death Scythe (Ki, Attack)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;+ 2 Attack, This attack hits all enemy units within 2 Inches of Maria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ooo - Shadow of Death (Magic, Attack)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;+ 5 Attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
