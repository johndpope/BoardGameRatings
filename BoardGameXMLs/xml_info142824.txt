			<description>&amp;quot;Gyakuten Kenji 2 (逆転検事2, lit. 'Turnabout Prosecutor 2'), unofficially referred to as Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth 2, is an adventure video game for the Nintendo DS handheld game console by Capcom. It is the sixth game in the Ace Attorney series, and a sequel to Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth. There are currently no plans for Capcom to release the game outside Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;The game features gameplay largely reminiscent of its predecessor, Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth, with the 'Investigation', 'Logic' and 'Confrontation' modes returning. A new element involves 'Chess Logic'. During conversations with certain characters, the player must find a weakness in the conversation within a limited amount of time. The player is given two choices of dialogue. At times one of these pieces will show a chess piece; the player, if they believe they have an advantage in the conversation over the other character, can select the chess piece option. If the player does not yet have the advantage, they will lose some of the time meter, and will have to continue asking other probing questions in order to further build up their advantage. However, if the player does have an advantage, as represented by the relative strength of the chess pieces shown, they will succeed in overthrowing the character's conversation and progress in the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Gyakuten Kenji 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
