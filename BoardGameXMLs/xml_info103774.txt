							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Duplicate Heartless: The Trick-taking Dice Game</name>
									
			<description>Duplicate Heartless is a trick-taking game that utilizes dice instead of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, dice are rolled and players use them to win tricks, rather than cards being shuffled.  The dice act in a same manner as would cards with suits with value, like is done in the domino game 42.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the value on dice represent both the suit being led, and the value in the suit.  After getting their dice to use for the round, a player will lead with die number, and players follow suit, and then follow up with the die.  In Duplicate Heartless, the goal is to avoid taking trick, or shoot the moon, as is the case in Hearts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of dice allows for a wide range of combinations that can come up during a round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
