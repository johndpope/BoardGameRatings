							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crime Scene</name>
									
			<description>Newly appointed forensics detective Matt Simmons must solve his first case, which is the double murder of a co-worker and his wife.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will be able to use the touch screen to access certain features which can be used to solve crimes, including a messaging system which allows the player to be told clues from NPCs. The player can also interview NPCs that they encounter. The stylus can be used to scan the crime scene and the color of the cursor will change to indicate that the player has found an important object. Collecting evidence requires the player to pick up the piece of evidence and put it in a bucket of solution, and pressing a button when a meter appears to try and get the object to stay in the solution. The player will be able to dust for fingerprints by using a brush to leave powder over the prints and blowing into the microphone to remove excess dust. DNA can be analyzed by using a pipette to put the material onto a slide. The stylus can then be used to remove unwanted cells so that only the evidence is present. The player also has a credibility meter which will change depending on the players actions throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Crime Scene (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
