			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is designed with four first level characters in mind; note that a few scenes can be dangerous and that adventuring in the First World is inherently difficult so you should point out to the players that they must exercise caution. For the most part the players don&amp;rsquo;t have to fight much; in fact they&amp;rsquo;ll probably only face three fights in the entire scenario. Instead they have numerous opportunities to talk with people and investigate leads. This requires a bit more thinking but some of that thinking involves how best to get weapons, big vicious weapons; that should mollify those offended by too much talking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an event based scenario. These can be difficult to pull off right. The Cause and Effect section describes the method used to &amp;ldquo;map&amp;rdquo; out this scenario. This technique should provide a strong plot for the scenario, but not a plot for the players. Instead the antagonists have their own plots, follow their own agendas, and oftentimes those agendas place the players at risk. The players have only the plot they create themselves. They&amp;rsquo;re the monkey wrench trying to break up the machinations of the bad guys; they&amp;rsquo;re the targets trying to survive an array of forces bent on their destruction. How each group does that will be radically different from each other group. The fact that people hunt them makes it easier to have the adventure find the players, so there&amp;rsquo;s less necessity to keep the scenario on track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
