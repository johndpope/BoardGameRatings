			<description>From the Rules:  The Rickenbacker Ace Game is an exciting game that can be played by 2 to 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board represents the sky.  Each player uses 9 planes of the same color.  One plane is place in each square of its own color in back of the crossline, which represents the players base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is for a player to complete a mission with as many planes as possible by reaching the colored squares beyond the crossline in front of his own OBJECTIVE diagonally across the board from his starting base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moving in a clockwise direction each player moves 1 plane or &amp;quot;Flies&amp;quot; 1 plane 1 square diagonally across the board.  Planes may jump adjacent enemy planes (in any direction) and thus shoot it down.  When all of the player's planes have been shot down or reached their objectives the game is over and players get 1 point for each surviving plane in the objective and 2 points for each shot down enemy plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High points wins. The winner of five games becomes an ace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
