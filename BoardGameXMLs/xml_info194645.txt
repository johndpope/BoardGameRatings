							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Last Supper (2005)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself is modeled on a historical religious custom called an agape feast, which was essentially a potluck worship feast. This feast was similar to, but predates, the use of Communion as a ceremony. Plan amongst yourselves for a lengthy, leisurely meal, with dishes that you will all enjoy. Each player should bring a fair share of the food. We strongly encourage that as much of the cooking as possible be done by the players, rather than using store-bought items. Even players who can't normally cook can probably follow a recipe, make a salad, or the like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with a religious disclaimer.  In the game, the game master assumes the role of Jesus Christ and the remaining players are His apostles.  Play revolves around Christ being unable clearly to explain His doctrine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
