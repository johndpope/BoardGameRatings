			<description>The player who has first moved all his 4 Pins over the board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is a 6x8 Chess field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a mixture between Pachesi and Chess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll a die. With 6 the Player has to place a pin on the first row of the plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The figures move like the figures in Chess. Which Chess figure they are at the moment is shown in a little hole in the field where the figure stands. There is a board below the fields. This can be moved in the positions 1-6. Each position changes the chess values for all fields. The rolled die shows on which position this board is moved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All chess figures of a player on the board are moved in each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player has to throw out an opponent figure if possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
