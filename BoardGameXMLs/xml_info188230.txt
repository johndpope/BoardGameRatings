							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Simple Campaigning</name>
									
			<description>48-page A5 full colour booklet containing campaign frameworks for ancient and medieval warfare, which can be played as boardgames or as bases for miniatures battles. Includes Solo Campaigning (the rise of Rome), Angevin Empire, Across the Steppes (Mongol conquests), The Millennium Campaign (11th century Europe), Crisis of Rome (3rd century AD), The Wolf on the Fold (Assyrian Empire), The Calamitous Fourteenth Century (late medieval Europe).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the seven games contains rules for re-creating the conflicts of a historical epoch and region, with counters on a map and using either a combat results table or miniatures.  They vary widely in complexity; some have minimal rules and can be played very quickly, while others have detailed political and/or economic rules.  The games are designed to entertain both historical boardgamers and miniatures buffs.  Several can easily be played solitaire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The point of each game is to determine by die rolls where conflicts arise, fight the battles and compare the outcome with history.  Several include victory point tables so that players can measure their success against each other or, if playing solitaire, against the historical outcome - for example, can the player outdo the Lionheart and King John in holding the Angevin Empire together?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the games can easily be completed in an hour, if using a combat results table; others take considerably longer, while all can last for many sessions if the battles are fought on the tabletop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
