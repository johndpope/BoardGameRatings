			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon Lord is back &amp;ndash; and this time he&amp;rsquo;s serious! In Dungeons 2, fulfil the Dark Lord&amp;rsquo;s insatiable quest for vengeance by recruiting fearsome new monsters from all corners of the underworld in order to undertake his evil bidding. Taking over the underworld isn&amp;rsquo;t enough though &amp;ndash; this time The Dungeon Lord will extend his dominion over the puny humans and attempt to conquer the overworld too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeons 2 offers unique gameplay &amp;ndash; while in the underworld it&amp;rsquo;s a classic Dungeon Manager simulation, in the outside world, you&amp;rsquo;ll have tactical real-time strategy. Take control of the mighty Dungeon Lord and craft a network of unique and terrifying dungeons, recruit an army of fearsome creatures and command two new factions: the combative Horde and a second, yet to be revealed malicious faction. Prepare to defend your kingdom against those pesky heroes, go above ground to wage war on their human cities and use the &amp;lsquo;Hand of Terror&amp;rsquo; to take direct control over your minions, issue commands, and even dish out a swift slap to keep them in line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The extensive campaign story mode of Dungeons 2 is packed with even more of the dark humour which made the original Dungeons a hit and is peppered with numerous references to various fantasy books, movies and TV shows. Additionally, you can test your strength in four different game modes in multiplayer for up to four players with other Dungeon Lords over LAN or online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
