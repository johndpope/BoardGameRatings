							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Adventure 7: The Rescue of Princess Millandriell (fan expansion to HeroQuest)</name>
									
			<description>This adventure has a very simple story line. So to make it more interesting we started the Heroes from beginning stats and built them up as the story moved along. The Oger and Giant Wolf really added a lot of excitment to the game so they were used a lot. We hope that you will have as much fun with this adventure as we did creating it.&lt;br/&gt;The pages for this adventure are available to download at &amp;quot;Dragonkingdoms.co.uk&amp;quot; and yahoo's group site &amp;quot;HeroQuest-Adventures&amp;quot; for free. You do need to join the group to access the file's section where they are stored. The photo section of this site will allow you to read the story and look at the maps to see if this game is something you would like to play. Your adventure awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
