			<description>From the rules booklet:&lt;br/&gt;A game of strategy and conquest in the Altara system.  Your goal is to engage and beat the opponent's squadron of fighters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is played on a three-dimensional gameboard of four levels.  Each level is 49 hexes.  One hex = 5000 km.  The levels are separated by a distance of 10,000 km.  By using the special four-sided die, you maneuver your fighters to engage the enemy without flying off the edge of the board - and out of the Altara system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two or more players can play this game simultaneously, each being in command of a squadron of fighters.  A squadron may have one, two, three or four fighters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, each fighter has eight energy units.  Should the number drop to zero, the fighter is considered destroyed and must be taken out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in turns, each one being made up of three phases:  Phase One - Movement, Phase Two - firing and Phase Three - damage assessment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The special die is rolled - player rolling highest chooses to move and fire first or last in the phases.  Damages are totaled and tallied on the score sheets. Movement can be done on the same level or the fighters may move up or down one level.  Attack strength is determined by distance to the target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the last remaining fighter on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
