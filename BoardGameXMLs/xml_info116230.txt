							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crime and Punishment</name>
									
			<description>Crime and Punishment is a 1980s legal simulation game released for the Commodore 64 and MS-DOS. The player assumed the role of a sentencing judge in a criminal law matter before the courts. Information available to the player included details on the nature of the crime committed, the defendants prior criminal history and pre-sentencing reports. The player could also review known facts relating to the case before sentencing the prisoner to probation, jail, prison or even choose the death penalty. In the case of imprisonment, the player also chose the length of prison term. Scoring was related to how closely the sentence handed out by the player matched that of the game recommendation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Crime and Punishment (video game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
