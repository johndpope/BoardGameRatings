			<description>&amp;ldquo;Take Care of Polar Bears&amp;rdquo; is a Serious Game with a theme of ecological crisis of polar bears caused by climate change. The North pole glaciers continue to melt due to global warming. The polar bears can not stay in one place anymore and must move to find new glaciers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, as the glacier disappears, polar bears must move larger distances, they cannot get enough food, and thus, suffer a great crisis. The player will become a polar bear, who will have to overcome virus and disease, escape from pursuit of Inuit, and arrive to Greenland as quickly as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The difference between 1st and 2nd editions of &amp;quot;Take Care of Polar Bears&amp;quot; are the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. All artwork is changed&lt;br/&gt;2. Adding new 4 characters&lt;br/&gt;3. Adding unique roles for new characters and modifying rules&lt;br/&gt;4. Change of winning goal&lt;br/&gt;5. Adding a new story of the game&lt;br/&gt;6. Change of the design of all components&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall difference with the first edition is that the new characters appear and new rules are added, the change of the existing character's abillity/rules, and also adding a story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
