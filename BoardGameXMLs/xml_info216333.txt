			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spells Within Spells!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vancian spellcasting (the method of casting spells of certain levels from limited numbers of spell slots) has been around since the beginning of the game, and it has a long and storied history. Many attempts have been made to replace it with other systems, but there is a certain charm to Vancian magic that keeps bringing the game back to it, over and over again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that Vancian spellcasting couldn&amp;rsquo;t use a fresh coat of paint, and maybe to learn a trick or two. This book pushes the boundaries of what magic can do in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. A collection of over 100 brand new, never-before-seen spells, it features several new mechanics that explore the value and utility of a spell slot, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Bonded spells, which can be prepared in the same slot as another spell, allowing the caster to use either one.&lt;br/&gt;    Composite spells, which can be cast normally, or by expending multiple lower-level spell slots.&lt;br/&gt;    Divisible spells, which can have their effect divided up across multiple castings, allowing the caster to use just as much magical energy as the situation calls for.&lt;br/&gt;    Fountain spells, a fan favorite from past installments of Advanced Arcana, which allow you to regain a lost spell slot upon casting the spell.&lt;br/&gt;    Ritual spells, which blend the occult rituals of Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Occult Adventures with more traditional magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond these, there are numerous spells of a more traditional nature, as well as several appendices containing new and exotic familiars, feats and magic items that interact with the new mechanics in the book, and even a section introducing the idea of miscast spells, versions of spells that have gone partially awry, but not enough so that they have no effect at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve already experienced one of the previous installments of Advanced Arcana, you know that this book is not to be missed. And if you haven&amp;rsquo;t, now is the perfect time to expand your magical horizons. Pick up your copy of Advanced Arcana Volume VII, and change the way that you think about magic today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
