							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Spells of the Nile</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Master the Magic of the Nile!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The magic of the Old Kingdom is potent, but it is also hidden, and in many places has been all but forgotten. This book contains 5 new Egyptian-themed spells for players of a variety of classes, as well as mythic versions of those spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dreaded and powerful sandstorm can create searing winds that will slowly sear everything in mile radius (or more, with mythic power), and also unleashes a devastating cyclone of sandy destruction in the heart of that storm. If you prefer a more subtle approach, use beetle bore to animate a tiny scarab which burrows into the heart of your victim, weakening and quite possibly killing him. Blood scrying draws on the proud Egyptian tradition of blood magic and allows you to look into the past, or even the future, while insatiable thirst leaves victims gasping for water as they frantically scramble to avoid dying of dehydration. Finally, tomb hex is the ultimate spell for guarding any door or portal, and with mythic power it not only stops intruders, but may also turn them into undead guardians who continue to protect the warded place even after the spell ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
