			<description>Publisher summary&lt;br/&gt;Make enough of each food for one bite-sized morsel for every player. Place morsels in the center of the play area.&lt;br/&gt;You are all entities consuming a different individual&amp;rsquo;s personality. Use one food item to inspire your host&amp;rsquo;s identity.&lt;br/&gt;Each round, in turns, eat one morsel and recount a memory or thought you consume from your host, related to the flavor you eat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Judge Comments&amp;rsquo;&lt;br/&gt;By far one of the most powerful games I saw, Feast is having an intense conversation about appropriation, control, and the erasure of culture by colonialism and invasion. Food as a mechanic points out the consumption by the powerful of the remnants of the powerless, and allows for a unique experience while playing. The game demonstrates clearly how powerful colonial cultures consume and appropriate other cultures, and then spit it back out (by talking about it) with their own twists and views on it. The questions provide food for thought on being infected, and how many times conquered cultures begin to assimilate the culture of the conquerors. - Kate Bullock&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
