							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tie &#039;N Tangle</name>
									
			<description>Possibly trying to cash in on the Twister fad, Tie 'N Tangle aims for the same type of party/dexterity play experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is given a disk in one of four colors to stand on. A ball of the same color is attached to the disk via a 12 foot length of twine. An outside player (&amp;quot;the umpire&amp;quot;) uses a spinner to direct the players how to loop their ball-on-a-string around another player's body part. For example, if the spinner indicates &amp;quot;Yellow, Left Leg,&amp;quot; then the current player must loop their ball-on-a-string around the Yellow player's left leg. Play continues until only one player is left who is able to complete an indicated move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tagline from the box: &amp;quot;The most hilarious... knottiest... fun game for the whole family.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
