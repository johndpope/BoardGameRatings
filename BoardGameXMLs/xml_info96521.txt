			<description>In this game each player is in control of a network of nano-robots on an expanding grid playing area made up of interconnected tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to create all your avaliable robots before anyone else does, but along the way you can gain enhancements to make your nano-robots better at replicating by enhancing skills.  Efficiently creating new robots is important, but over teching can result in your opponents getting to the end goal faster then you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with dice representing your nano-robots, and the pips indicate the energy level it is currently at.  There are several available actions you can perform on your turn, and one of them is reducing the value of the pips on a die by one and then creating a new die adjacent to it with a value of one.  Players can also lay down new tiles from their hand as an action, as well as energizing certain dice which increases their pip value by a variable amount, or transfer energy around between their nano-bots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You only have two actions available to you on each turn, so planning ahead is important! Your opponents will do things that alter your plans, but the way you lay your tiles can dictate just how affected you can be by their actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
