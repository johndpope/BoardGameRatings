							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ranger, Revised</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past year, you&amp;rsquo;ve seen us try a number of new approaches to the ranger, all aimed at addressing the class&amp;rsquo;s high levels of player dissatisfaction and its ranking as D&amp;amp;D&amp;rsquo;s weakest class by a significant margin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those two factors combined to put us on the path to this revision. Though the revised ranger retains many of the elements of the existing class, a lot has changed, so it&amp;rsquo;s best to simply dig into the new material to get a sense of how it feels. But at the same time, the release of this revision gives us a chance to talk about how a revised class can best be implemented as part of the D&amp;amp;D game&amp;mdash;and how the game will evolve in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can think of the material presented in this series as similar to the first wave of the fifth edition playtest. These game mechanics are in draft form, usable in your campaign but not fully tempered by playtests and design iterations. They are highly volatile and might be unstable; if you use them, be ready to rule on any issues that come up. They&amp;rsquo;re written in pencil, not ink. For these reasons, material in this column is not legal in D&amp;amp;D Organized Play events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The material presented in Unearthed Arcana will range from mechanics that we expect one day to publish in a supplement to house rules from our home campaigns that we want to share, from core system options to setting-specific material. Once it&amp;rsquo;s out there, you can expect us to check in with you to see how it&amp;rsquo;s working out and what we can do to improve it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
