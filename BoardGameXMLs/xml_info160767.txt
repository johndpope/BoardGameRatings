			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Hermetic is a video game from 1993. The story is about the energy on the planet Hermetic, it is soon gone, the planet is using the last reserves. A troop is sent out to &amp;quot;unknown galaxies&amp;quot; in search for energy. One of the troopers (the player) is reading about a casino-planet called Haag, in a newspaper at a pub onboard a space station. With the leaders of Hermetic's approval, the trooper bet the homeplanet for energy. You now have to play H.A.M.M. (Haag's Agressive Maneuver Moon), six tunnels with robots programmed to kill. Just a few have survived it. Hermetic is a side-scrolling shoot'em up in space, with six levels, each ending with a boss fight. After each level the player, visiting a bar in the spacestation of H.A.M.M., and can play one of three classix arcade games (minigame-clone of Pac-Man, Space Invaders, or Breakout), that can give the player extra life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
