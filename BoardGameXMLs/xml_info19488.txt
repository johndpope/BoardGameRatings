			<description>A card game.  To win, have the lowest points, once a player reaches 100 the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;A round ends when one player discards their hand.  Remaining card points are now tallied.&lt;br/&gt;Each person gets seven cards.  There are blue and wild zone cards.  Blue or wild can be played with another blue or wild card if the sum of the cards played and the top card of the discard pile sum to ten.&lt;br/&gt;Players can play out of turn using only wild zone cards, again totaling to ten.&lt;br/&gt;If a play cannot be made, the player must pass and draw one card, only if the top card is wild.  A play is now allowed if able.  If everyone passes, the top draw card is placed on the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
