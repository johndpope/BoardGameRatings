			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WorldWorks Games is proud to present &amp;quot;Gothic Realms&amp;rdquo;. Gothic Realms features over 56 unique items to help you design and build virtually any dungeon layout imaginable! Gothic Realms raises the bar once more with intensely detailed hand crafted textures and a design flexibility that makes this model set a &amp;ldquo;must have&amp;rdquo; tool for those serious about 25-28mm miniature gaming. Utilizing WorldWorks innovative &amp;ldquo;Clip-It&amp;rdquo; corridors and walls you can quickly secure all of your maze and room designs on the fly with ordinary paper clips. Drop on the warp proof &amp;ldquo;Easy Slide&amp;rdquo; doors anywhere and on any wall. Fill your rooms and halls with one of dozens of traps and props. Raise the height of your wall sections with the innovative gothic wall risers for an intensely dramatic effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just when you thought this model set had it all WorldWorks has included a fully modular sewer system which comes in four unique themes; Sewer &lt;font color='#ffff00'&gt;Yellow&lt;/font&gt;, &lt;font color='#ff0000'&gt;Blood Red&lt;/font&gt;, &lt;font color='#00cc99'&gt;Mystic Green&lt;/font&gt; and &lt;font color='#0066ff'&gt;Aquaduct Blue&lt;/font&gt;.

Round off this amazing model set with the WorldWorks &amp;ldquo;Masterboard&amp;rdquo; gameboard design featuring a variety of 7 by 7 inch floor tiles in various themes.
