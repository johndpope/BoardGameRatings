							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fortune Seeker</name>
									
			<description>The board has 4 quadrants where players can seek their fortune in the Casino, Race Track, Real Estate, and Stock Market. In the Casino, you are playing blackjack while in the Race Track, you are horse racing. In Real Estate, you are buying and selling property, while in the Stock Market you are buying and selling stock. Each quadrant includes playing squares from the other three to keep the entire game active at all times e.g. there are Casino, Real Estate, and Stock Market playing squares in the Race Track quadrant. When you unfold the board it measures 38&amp;quot; by 24&amp;quot;. There are two methods of winning Fortune Seeker. The most common is to be the first player to arrive at or pass through the boards center logo with at least $10,000,000 cash and no debt. The second is to be the owner of an oil field in Real Estate that has an oil gusher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
