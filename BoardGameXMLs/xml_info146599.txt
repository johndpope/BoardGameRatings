			<description>Catalog Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Try Running the Roman Empire&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EMPEROR is entirely a game of strategy, played on a graphic map of the Roman Empire as it as in the first four centuries A.D. The player takes the part of the Emperor and he must pit his wits and forces against invading barbarians, rebellious provincials and treacherous Roman Generals. Even the Plebs of Rome will have to be placated with bread and circuses if the Emperor is to keep his head and his throne. If he can last out the first eight years of the game, he is judged on the state of the Empire at the end of that time. There are three levels of play. Depending upon his choice, the Emperor has to guide the Empire through three centuries with each century reflecting a different set of historical circumstances. During play Legions must be raised, taxes inflicted and troops moved. The choice of Generals can be critical - some are loyal and good fighters, some are neither. Battles must be fought and invasions repelled. All the while the citizens in Rome must be kept happy and - you must keep an  eye on those Barbarians in outer Britannia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
