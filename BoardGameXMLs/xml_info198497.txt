			<description>Life after dishonor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tomb of the ancient barbarian prince Hammon has overlooked the village of Hammon's Creche for centuries. None have ever pierced its haunted portals, and the bones of all who have dared circle the hilltop surrounding the tomb. Yet rumours persist of fabulous treasure buried with the Prince, including his legendary axe, armour, and shield. But recently, miners who dug into the base of Hammon's Tor were never heard from again, and villagers whisper that the mines are now haunted by barbarian spirits. Could a new way have been found into the tomb? And what of the sightings of white clad figures near the mine entrance?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A multi-session adventure for four characters of 7th level&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
