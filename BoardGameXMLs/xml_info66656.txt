			<description>Subtitled &amp;quot;Hunt And Kill The Evil Dictator&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Background section of the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is a fictional fantasy scenario where a very powerful nation wishes to 'decapitate a regime' (this is the technical term for political assassination). This is a highly detailed simulation and not 'battleships in Baghdad' at all. Most definitely not.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The forces of good, Freedonia, led by President George W Hackenbush - being democratic cannot simply fire a nuclear weapon at the capital city of their enemy - they must use precision guided munitions and bombs to seek out the corrupt and evil Dictator they seek to &amp;lsquo;neutralise&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br/&gt;These weapons are expensive so the bill will mount up.&lt;br/&gt;They must also avoid civilian casualties.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;If the campaign to decapitate the regime fails to do so before a certain time has elapsed (see Ground War below), or the civilian deathtoll reaches 2,500 or the PR damage reaches 50 - Freedonia will have failed to achieve victory and the game ends.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Play is on two gridded maps of the Capital City - Badmum. Some grid squares contain headquarter buildings, Presidential Palaces and the like - other contain Ancient monuments, hotels, embassies and residential districts.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
