			<description>This game is based on Battleship, but here you also determine the type of terrain, and type of unit. You can win also making a specific objective, like destroy all ships from your enemy or 2 armies and 3 ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 types of terrain. Beach/ocean, field and mountains. Also, there are 3 types of units: ships, planes and armies. The game follows the Battleship style, with players alternating in saying the coordinates and type of unit attacking and being attacked. If you are right, you capture the enemy unit. You win making your objective or capturing 10 units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
