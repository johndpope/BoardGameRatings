							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crypt of Mandazed (SRS)</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only rumors remain of the evil wizard Mandazed. Not seen for many a year, Mandazed once frightened the local populace with his strange experiments and bizarre visitors. His three story tower once sat upon a distant hill overlooking the town but now lies in ruin. Stories are told of the freak lightning storm that burned the tower down to its base level... and the immediate disappearance of Mandazed thereafter. Some say he was killed in the storm, but others think he left in search of other towns to terrorize.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one dares to enter the ruined tower of Mandazed. Those that have tried have never returned. Townsfolk believe that something evil now lurks there...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note:&lt;br/&gt;For one player and a game master. Billed as &amp;quot;easy&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
