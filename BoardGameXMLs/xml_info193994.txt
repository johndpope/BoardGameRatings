			<description>Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crudelis is a 60 minutes long steampunk RPG game. You're Henry - a young scientist obsessed with an idea of bringing people back to life. Unforunately, the experiment was interrupted and you have only 60 minutes to solve the mystery of your death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Henry Shackelton is the main protagonist of Crudelis. Since the tragic death of Ann - his fiancee - Henry is obsessed with an idea of creating a machine able to bring people from the dead. This is the only way he can regain meaning of his life. Although it's been years since he came to Abarian Creek and many people know him, no one will do anything to help him voluntarily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Crudelis is torn apart by inside conflicts. The rich caste of businessmen is treating their workers as subhumans. Trust is a weakness, because everybody looks only for their profit. The knowledge expands, throwing people into eugenics. It's not easy to convince others to help you deal with your problems. What inspired us was the historical impact of the 19th century Industrial Revolution, as well as the fantasy classics - such as &amp;quot;The Time Machine&amp;quot; by H.G. Wells or J. Verne's &amp;quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though one session takes maximum of 60 minutes, Crudelis has much more to offer. The plot constantly forces you to pick numerous and not obvious decisions based on residual data, as well as the player's intuition (just like in &amp;quot;The Witcher&amp;quot;). As a result, you can end up experiencing one of the 12 endings... or not seeing any of them, if you won't follow the things of most importance to you. As a matter of fact, there is nothing wrong with sitting in a bar and drinking, or wandering around aimlessly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Precisely 60 minutes of gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Non-linear plot with 12 main endings&lt;br/&gt;Fight your enemies with the power of your intellect, not physical force&lt;br/&gt;Emotional soundtrack created with a piano, violins and cellos&lt;br/&gt;Steampunk atmosphere&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
