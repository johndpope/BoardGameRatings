							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blocks That Matter</name>
									
			<description>When indie game developers Alexey and Markus are in trouble, their only hope comes from their creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the Tetrobot: a tiny robot that can drill blocks of matter one by one, collect them, and recycle them into new pieces of 4 blocks. You also have the possibility to destroy lines of 8+ blocks in a very &amp;laquo;retro russian&amp;raquo; game style. Sand, wood, stone, obsidian, iron, diamond: each matter has its specific behaviour you'll have to use wisely and take advantage of them. So get ready to use your brain and combine your platforming and puzzle-solving skills in this incredible mashup!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
