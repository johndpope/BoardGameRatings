			<description>A game for the piecepack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player requires:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* 6 piecepack tiles (doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter which ones)&lt;br/&gt;    * 4 piecepack dice&lt;br/&gt;    * 24 coins from one piecepack (all 4 suits, null/2-5/ace each suit)&lt;br/&gt;    * opaque bag, cup, or other means of mixing 24 piecepack coins for random drawing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player is designated the scorekeeper. That person needs:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* notepad and pencil, or some other scorekeeping mechanism&lt;br/&gt;    * an additional piecepack tile&lt;br/&gt;    * 3 pawns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: Score the most points after a predetermined number of rounds (7 rounds makes an excellent game). Object of each round is to be one of the first players to clear your card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is very similar to Bingo in the sense that each player possesses a &amp;ldquo;card,&amp;rdquo; which one marks based on a random element. In this case, you are attempting to remove coins based on the roll of 4 dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
