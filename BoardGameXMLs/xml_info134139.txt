							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bar Hopping</name>
									
			<description>Bar Hopping is a roll-and-move drinking game which instructs players on alternatives to drinking and driving. Players (or teams of players) move their playing pieces (cars) around the board and perform actions on cards that they draw, depending on which space they land on. The first player (or team) to complete the predetermined number of kilometers is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You and your friends are out bar hopping, when you suddenly realize that nobody can legally drive. So you all decide that the smartest thing to do would be to take a cab home. Great move, but here is where the twist in the game begins. While riding home in the cab, everyone falls asleep and starts to dream. These dreams turn into the worst nightmares of your life. Believe it or not, you actually start dreaming that you are driving home from the bar. Like most dreams, this one is just as crazy, as you will soon find out. When the dreams begin, so does the game. The only way to wake up and end these horrible nightmares is to win the game by being the first person, or team, to obtain the predetermined amount of kilometers set before starting the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
