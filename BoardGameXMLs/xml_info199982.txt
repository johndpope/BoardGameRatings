			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was designed to serve as a starting point or major transitioning point for a given sci-fi campaign using any rules system, written to be game system agnostic by design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is designed for 4 to 6 players with at least one character that has technician or engineering skills to help negotiate technical issues like jammed doors, and otherwise bypassing damaged or inoperable technology. At least one character needs to be a star ship pilot and another as a soldier or commando.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters form an elite team of troubleshooters serving some interstellar navy, and have been stationed on a large star ship or mobile space station with jump and maneuver drives. Destined for actions at a far away location requiring a vast distance to&lt;br/&gt;travel, the adventurers are placed into cryogenic sleep pods to minimize life support requirements over such a long journey, thus are set on an 18 month cold sleep cycle before they are awakened at journey&amp;rsquo;s end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
