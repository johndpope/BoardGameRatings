			<description>Each player selects a color and places the corresponding candles, rosettes, and marbles on top the plastic cake in front of them.  One player turns over a card from the deck, which will show one of the numbers that matches the numbers on the rosettes.  Simultaneously all players will try to blow the marble off their numbered candle.  The marbles that are successfully blown off will fall into the middle of the cake and down a chute.  The player whose marble falls down the chute first wins the round.  All other players must put their marbles back onto their candles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to blow all 4 of their candles out wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
