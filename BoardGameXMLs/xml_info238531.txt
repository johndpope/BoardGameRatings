			<description>Lockwood's Asylum is a competitive survival horror deck-building game for 2 to 5 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike most deck-building games, Lockwood's Asylum allows players to build not only their own decks, but also the decks of their opponents. Each time a player purchases a Monster or Horror card, that card goes into the play area - or &amp;quot;Room&amp;quot; - of the player to their left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any Ally cards that a player purchases go into their own Room, where they help defend against the Monsters and Horrors that have been placed there by the others players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the turn, the Allies, Monsters, and Horrors in the player's Room battle it out! If the Monsters are able to overwhelm the player's Allies, then any excess damage lowers the player's Health. When a player is reduced to 0 Health, they are eliminated from the game. The last player left standing survives the night and claims victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
