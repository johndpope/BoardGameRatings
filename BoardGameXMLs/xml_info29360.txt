			<description>Turvapaikka (Asylum) is a board game about asylum seekers in European Union. Each player has a certain background story given by his/her profile card and 20 points to begin with. The story has minor effects on gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll dice and move around the square monopoly-like game board. Most spaces of the track represent countries, but there are also spaces for traffic hubs, Red Cross, immigration detention centre, lawyer and event card pickup (authorities, everyday life). Usually landing on a space decreases player's points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player may apply for asylum in one country. The odds for being granted asylum are given by country cards and they reflect some statistic characteristics of the real country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player's game ends once he/she has run out of points and so been deported out of EU, or if he/she manages to get asylum (win) or a temporary residence permit (lose). It is possible that none of the players win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
