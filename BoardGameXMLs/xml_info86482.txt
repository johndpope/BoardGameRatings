							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Conquest of Japan</name>
									
			<description>From the Game Maunal:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conquest of Japan is set in 16th century Japan. At this time, Japan was effectively a group of small states, each ruled by a lord, or Daimyo. Because these states were constantly fighting each other, the period became known as the Sengoku period- meaning &amp;quot;a country at war with itself.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conquest of Japan is a game of land conquest. Played on a map of Honshu, Japan's main island, you begin with five cities or towns, as does your opponent. Each of these towns carries an entitlement to a set number of koku - the currency used in Japan to hire warriors. You must use your koku to raise a band of warriors in each town. Each town will have a different army. Then direct your men towards your chosen target city -- or towards one or more enemy armies if you are seeking an early confrontation!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever two sides meet, a battle will be played out using a&lt;br/&gt;unique miniature-style system. The results of this battle will be fed back into the strategic level game. The strategic game is more important than the individual battles for ultimate success -- remember that you can lose a battle but win the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
