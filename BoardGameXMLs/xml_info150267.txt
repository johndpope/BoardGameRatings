			<description>Hexopolis is a fast-paced, intense strategy card game that includes tactical elements thanks to a dynamic board and zombies controlled by all players. Expect to be kept on your toes with cutthroat moves and counter-moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won and lost by activating ingredients on the table; two different ones to win, two identical ones to lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start by creating the board from a set of hexagonal tiles around a tile marked as the Altar set in the middle of the table. Then, they draw five cards and play their move in turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The different actions from the cards include summoning zombies, moving them to specific tiles to bring ingredient cards from one's hand to the table, or sacrifice zombies on the Altar tile to activate or deactivate ingredients already on the table.&lt;br/&gt;Cards can also be combined into advanced actions that bend the rules (steal cards, cancel actions, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are in English and French. Cards are bilingual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comes as a printed-on-demand box or as a PDF file.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
