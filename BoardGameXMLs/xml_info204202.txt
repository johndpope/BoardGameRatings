			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About eighteen years ago, a young street witch named Cariole succeeded in catching the eye of the powerful Magus Lord Adrian &amp;quot;Lightcaller,&amp;quot; a mage specializing in the use of light-based spells. Other mages tried to warn Lightcaller away from the girl, who was already known in the Order as a bad seed, but he was deaf to their warnings and their romance lasted a tumultuous year and half, until Adrian was killed in a back street down in the Chifes, where he sometimes did missionary work. Rumor has it that Cariole had spiked his drink with Morhiet root, or &amp;quot;Wizardsbane&amp;quot; - which makes a mage incapable of tapping into the akasic patterns to use magic. However, she did retreat in mourning, only to reappear a year later and enjoy her rather large inheritance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For characters of 3rd - 5th level and good alignment.  Party should possess magical weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
