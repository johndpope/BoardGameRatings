			<description>Bogey The Tentacle has sworn to take over the world and is invading earth in his Positronic-Piece-Dropping ship! As he attacks with multiple pieces, you have to place them in an isometric 3D grid to form Quads. Each Quad you form returns damage to Bogey (which makes him angrier!). You must prevent Bogey from overloading the grid by constantly forming Quads, or else Earth is doomed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you progress, you earn gold in the game! You can use that to purchase and upgrade Earth's defenses to ward Bogey off and slow down his invasion. But watch out! Bogey is as fiery as his color and will unleash relentless attacks as he gets angrier!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
