			<description>Seven little goats hide in a house as the wolf is coming. As in the fairy tale, one of them hides in a clock (which is a frame for a sand timer), the others hide in other pieces of furniture (the beautiful material actually contains wooden little furniture with space to hide the goats.&lt;br/&gt;The players take turns rolling dice. The wolf moves toward the furniture, the goat player moves the chairs to block the wolf's path. When a clock symbol is rolled, the sand timer is set in motion (wolf's roll) or suspended (goat player's roll). If the wolf manages to find all goats before the sand timer has run through twice, the wolf is the winner; if not, the goat player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
