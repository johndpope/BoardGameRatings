			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have several Attributes, some of which have values assigned from a points pool, the remainder have values derived from modified die rolls.  Generally, Attributes will have a numeric value from 7 - 10.  Play involves a series of team matches with success depending largely on card plays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game also have an &amp;quot;off-pitch&amp;quot; goal, primarily political in nature.  These are secret goals that characters would not admit to others.  While the team goal - win the competition - is obvious and involves all players, these &amp;quot;off-pitch&amp;quot; goals are neither obvious nor necessarily cooperative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is distributed as two PDF files, both of which are required to play the game. One is an A4 &amp;quot;sticker album&amp;quot;, containing the player profile sheet, off-pitch goals and opposition statistics. The other is an A3 wall chart that forms the centerpiece of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summaries and references are provided in supplementary files, as well as an A4 version of the football pitch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
