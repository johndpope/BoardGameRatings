			<description>Subtitled: &amp;quot;A Game of Points&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was even included a button of which states: &amp;quot;I'm a CheckOrDice 'ER&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This has a checkerboard gameplay area of 8x8 with a separate scoring track provided off to the sides. There are some of the white squares depicted with a value, like the faces of a die, hence their being known as &amp;quot;Dice&amp;quot;. Those white squares of which have no die depicted are called the &amp;quot;Check&amp;quot; squares. The black squares are never in play at all. Each player has 12 tokens, that are referred to as &amp;quot;tiles&amp;quot;, with 2 smaller &amp;quot;markers&amp;quot; that players use to keep track of the score on the score track. Players move onto the &amp;quot;Dice&amp;quot;, and/or jump over an opponent's pieces in order to score.  The first player to amass 100 points is the winner!.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This also allows for doubling-up of the &amp;quot;tiles&amp;quot; when you have moved any to the opposite side/end of the board of &amp;quot;Gameplay&amp;quot; squares, whereupon those will score double the amounts later on then. There are also rules to extend the game if a longer duration is desired, with those being printed along the outside of the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Produced and published in Seattle, Washington, USA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
