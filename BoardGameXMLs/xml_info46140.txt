			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Sunlight glinted off the chill blue waters of the Krakenauricht. The lapping of waves against the merchant trader's hull threatened to lull the roundhsip's crew into relaxing their attentions, but these sailors were too seasoned to give their enemy that advantage. Pirates, deep-water denizens, and especially the abominable Kraken could decimate an unwary crew before they colud even load a ballista. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A shout from the crow's nest turned all eyes to the east. 'Pirate ship rounding the isles!' Every sailor hustled to battle stations. But the next cry chilled the blood of even the oldest mate. 'Something in the water to starboard! Sturgeon...no! A tentacle! Ready ballistas! It's the Kraken!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wrapped along the shoreline of the Krakenauricht, the nations of Brecht&amp;uuml;r thrive on - and are challenged by - their relationship with the waters of Cerilia. Undisputed masters of the sea, the Brechts have carved out a niche as merchants, traders, and seafarers, avoiding the imperialism of the Anuireans and the predations of the awensheglien.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Brecht ports promise a steady flow of heroes, villains, goods, information, and opportunities. Whether characters are looking for adventure, a place to disappear, lands to conquer, or magic to control, they'll find it here - if pirates, monsters, and double-crossers don't find them first!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion to the BIRTHRIGHT campaign setting contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Havens of the Great Bay - 96 pages of history, geography, political alliances, major characters, and traders and seafarers of the Krakenauricht&lt;br/&gt;     A full-color poster map of the realms surrounding the Great Bay.&lt;br/&gt;     110 War Cards of new Brecht, elf, halfling, and humanoid armies.&lt;br/&gt;     Six cardsheets of important Brecht locales and player aids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
