			<description>Par &amp;quot;72&amp;quot; is an early Golf game that allows players to play a round of golf over 9 unique holes (5 on the front side of the large vinyl board, and 4 on the back), or to play a full round of 18 holes by utilizing both sides again. Play of the ball is somewhat programmed by line-of-flight paths, which are designated by the roll of the &amp;quot;position&amp;quot; die at tee-off. But the real key to success is in the choosing of the correct combination of the yardage dice that will get the ball where you want it to go. 3 large dice from 50-100 yards, 2 medium dice from 10-60 yards, 1 putting die from 10-30 yards, and 1 trap die from 0-50 yards. But clever combinations of the dice and a bit of luck, you just might be able to hole-out on this turn, or if you are really lucky, a hole-in-one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
