			<description>A boardgame where players travel round a map of Vietnam visiting sights.  Players start with 6 randomly dealt sight cards and 1 million dong. They need to locate their sights then calculate how to travel to all of them. They may travel by car (10,000 dong per step), boat (50,000 dong) or plane (100,000 dong per step).  Once they arrive at the sight they need to answer a question about Vietnamese culture, history or general knowledge (many questions are multi choice). If they answer correctly they move on to the next sight.  If they throw a 1 they pick up a chance card, which may add a random element by sending them to other parts of the board (eg to Nha Trang to go snorkelling, to the nearest hospital for treatment of a monkey bite).  The aim of the game is to be the first to travel round all 6 sights without running out of money.  In the process players learn the geography and other interesting information about Vietnam.  The board is colourful with photos and counters are china figurines of Vietnamese folk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
