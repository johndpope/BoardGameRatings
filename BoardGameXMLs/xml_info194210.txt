			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All-Star Wrestling Rejects is a fast paced collectible card game that features a roster of six not-so-super stars competing for the coveted ASWR Championship Gold!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're on Offense your objective is to create a sequence of moves that inflicts maximum damage to your opponent and that will, eventually, lead to a pin. Each move (card played) deals a certain amount of damage to your opponent. You play a card by matching up the specific color with the appropriate side to the Transition Move (last Offensive card played). Be careful what move you play, as the higher the damage that is dealt, the more sides that are blacked out. With 48 different Offensive moves to unleash, every match is a unique challenge! On Defense? Then prepare to use your Block cards to limit the options on, and hopefully completely block off, your opponents offensive sequence. Or you could always play that Reverse card . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throw Foreign Objects such as Kendo Sticks, Steel Chairs, Rubber Chickens, and Sporks into the mix to take your opponent out, but watch out! If your opponent plays a Referee Block card it could be game over. Each wrestler also has two Custom Finishers (for a total of 12 included in the game)! Can you survive The Hunchback Hillbilly's &amp;quot;Hurrican-Moron-A&amp;quot;, Abe Sherman's &amp;quot;Hip Replacement&amp;quot;, or The Bulkster's &amp;quot;Leg Plop&amp;quot;?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Starter Set includes everything you need to begin playing immediately!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
