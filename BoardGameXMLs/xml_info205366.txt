							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Holy Roman Empire Expansion 1: Battles of the Thirty Years War</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Holy Roman Empire is a strategic game, and while conflict is normally resolved abstractly by the throw of some dice, an Optional Tactical Combat system is included for those players seeking to add a bit more flavor to the game. This game-within-the-game system can also be used to re-fight some of the great battles of the Thirty Years War. The 12 scenarios included in this pack are not in-depth simulations of those epic contests; they are instead a collection of quick mini-games that are meant to allow players a glimpse into the way battles of that era were fought. As in any war, not every battle is an even contest; some are puzzles where players take turns commanding each army to see which of them can do better as the disadvantaged side--or through luck and skill turn an historic defeat into a surprising victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 12 battles in this pack are presented in chronological order, and if fought in that order will give players a brief running history of the war. Contestants may choose to play the games in any order, may select favorite battles to re-fight or may make a campaign by taking each battle in turn, with one player always taking the Imperial side in each contest and then tallying the results of each battle to reach a final score of wins and losses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players resolve the battles in this booklet utilizing the Optional Tactical Combat systems as found in the Holy Roman Empire game. Additional options for &amp;quot;Create Your Own&amp;quot; Battle scenarios are also included in those rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
