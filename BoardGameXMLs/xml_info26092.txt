			<description>This Italian cycling game has a modular board, meaning that you can compile your own track by combining road tiles. There are also traffic signs that can influence the game. The mechanics are dice controlled. There are 4 different levels in this game. As often in racing games the winner is the one who covers the distance first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
