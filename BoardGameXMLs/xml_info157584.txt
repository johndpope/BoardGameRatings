			<description>from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;hellip;this fully detailed scenario is based upon the &amp;ldquo;Mercenary Ticket&amp;rdquo; capsule adventure written by the same author for the Starfall Cluster Book, a Traveller d20 campaign&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A copy of the original &amp;ldquo;Mercenary Ticket&amp;rdquo; is reproduced as an Appendix, as are several other items of background colour taken from same publication that can be used as player handouts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is designed to played as a convention scenario in a limited amount of time. Thus there are&lt;br/&gt;certain events that will happen at certain times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is also designed to emulate an action movie, so the plot is relatively linear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Plot Summary:&lt;br/&gt;A mercenary team are sent to investigate loss of communication with a deep sea mining platform that is also used as a dumping ground for political dissidents. The mission is to secure the facility within 5 hours, when the next automated cargo submersible is due to arrive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
