							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">10 Down</name>
									
			<description>In each round of 10 Down, players are dealt ten cards. On their turn, they can swap one card at a time. The object is to create a sequenced run of cards from 1 to 10; that's a &amp;quot;10 Down&amp;quot; and you earn one point token! If you can create a color set, in order, of three or more cards (e.g., 7, 8, 9 yellow), you receive bonus tokens. The first player to collect ten points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may call your &amp;quot;10 Down&amp;quot; hand as soon as you get it, but you may want to press your luck and wait until you are able to build a color set of three or more cards to earn additional tokens. Keep in mind you never know when someone else is going to call. How long can you press your luck?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
