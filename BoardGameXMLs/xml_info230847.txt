			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF consists of resources and game statistics to enhance and update a book previously published by Chaosium, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stars Are Right! is a Call of Cthulhu modern-era scenario collection published by Chaosium (in print and PDF). It has been released in two editions, first in 1992 (as CHA2337) and later in 2004 (as CHA23100).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF pack, created as an independent add-on by Cthulhu Reborn, upgrades each of the scenarios from the Chaosium books in three ways:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    by providing fresh renditions of the numerous player handouts (and some new handouts),&lt;br/&gt;    by offering suggestions on updating them to be more relevant to the 21st Century setting, and&lt;br/&gt;    by translating their game stats for easy use with Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All handouts included in this collection are presented in high-quality form in full colour (for use as deluxe player props), and also provided as text-only handouts (for speedy access to clues).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE: This PDF is not a stand-alone product, but relies on having access to the Chaosium publication The Stars Are Right! (either CHA2337 or CHA23100).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
