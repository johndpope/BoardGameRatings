			<description>Early 20th century game around the storybook classic.  Spin and move action for children only.  Features stunning box cover art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(From boxtop): THE OBJECT OF THE GAME is to take a trip to Fairyland, avoiding the monsters and obstacles in the enchanted forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before entering the forest each player will meet or pass two good fairies who are able to help him through the forest and land him safely in Fairyland. If a player lands on either the &amp;quot;Bird&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Good Fairy&amp;quot;, they can safely pass through the forest without having to follow the directions on the monster or obstacle spaces. If a player does not land on either of these spaces before entering the forest, they have to follow the instructions on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no pass for the cave. If a player spins a number that will cause him to land on a space another player occupies, he forfeits that turn. No two counters may occupy the same space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player first reaching Fairyland by an exact count WINS THE GAME!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
