			<description>Art Dealer is a game about buying and selling of fine-art paintings, including Picasso's, Rembrandt's, and Carravagio's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can buy paintings from six galleries, specialising in Landscape, Portrait, History, Genre, Still-life, and Animal paintings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They can then sell these paintings at a profit (and an increase in reputation as an Art Dealer) to Collectors against Commissions. Each Commision specifies which movement the painting must come from (Renaissance/Mannerism, Baroque/Rococo, Neoclassicism/Romanticism, Impressionism/Symbolism, Cubism/Expressionism, or Surrealism/Contemporary).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alternatively, the can sell their painting to one of five Museums for less profit but greater increase in reputation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, they can Exhibit their painting to improve their cashflow and enhance the star-value of their paintings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other actions include taking money from Investors; employing an Art Historian to find paintings previosuly discarded; restoring damaged paintings to their full glory; and even forging paintings in the main galleries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
