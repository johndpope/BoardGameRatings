			<description>On to new treasures! On the other side of the old forest are the forgotten mines. Go with your dwarf clan looking and overcome joint obstacles, avoid falling and trolling, and above all: find the valuable treasures. But beware of the dragon and be aware that members of your clan can oppose you. In this spectacular board game version of Saboteur 2 dwarfs go looking for treasures. At the beginning of the game you get a role, so you know which clan you belong to. Loyal dwarfs neatly share their finds with their comrades. But there are also selfish dwarfs who keep everything to themselves. And saboteurs even secretly belong to the other clan! This new adventure in the world of Saboteur offers even more excitement and surprising situations!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from publisher (translated)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
