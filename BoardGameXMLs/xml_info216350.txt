			<description>Glory Gears is a historically accurate strategy game where 2 to 8 players control a race team of four riders and compete to be the first team to finish in a single or a series of races.  The game is inspired by Oscar Winning Movie, 'Breaking Away's' Little 500 Bicycle Race at Indiana University and created by Cutters Little 500 Champion Alex Bishop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glory Gears is an action packed, fast paced cycling strategy game with dynamic movement mechanics offering the most realistic gaming experience possible.  Besides a game that is incredibly historically accurate and movements that are mathematically correct, Glory Gears offers an amazingly fun play dynamic that evolves as players secretly choose to help others at times while other times breaking their friendships, alliances, and trust as the race draws closer to the end.  Added rules let you battle through wrecks, mechanicals, and secret team strategies while you create friends and foes racing your team of 4 riders around the track. However, as the checker flag approaches, there can only be one Glory Gears Champion!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glory Gears has a multitude of optional rules and ways to play to ensure your gaming experience can be tailored to your liking. Everything from, rider stamina reductions, wrecks, dropping exchanges, mechanicals, playing out secret historical team strategies based off how specific teams won in certain years, to even playing out the entire spring race series events like in real life before the Little 500 event.  Players can choose to play out a historically accurate Qualifications run(great for 1 to 8 players), an Individual Time Trial(great for 1 to 8 players), and a Team Pursuit which involves all 4 riders of a team on the track racing against another at the same time (great 2 person game), or a fan and tournament favorite of the race series Miss N' Out, which states the last rider of each lap is eliminated until there is only one left! (great big group game)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More info can be found at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.mindmeltgames.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.mindmeltgames.com&lt;/a&gt; .
