			<description>SOVEREIGN OF THE SEAS is an uncomplicated war game centered on the naval aspects of the series of wars between England and the various European powers between 1756 and 1805 for dominance of the world&amp;rsquo;s oceans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game depicts this conflict at a strategic level, with most operational and tactical details represented by fast and easy-to-play systems, rather than intricate mechanisms.  The intent of the game is to provide a broad overview of the historical events while being fun to play.  SOVEREIGN OF THE SEAS owes its original inspiration to the game concepts of WAR AT SEA published by The Avalon Hill Game Company, a game which covered the war in the Atlantic in World War Two.  SOVEREIGN OF THE SEAS borrows a number of these concepts from this earlier game as a starting point, such as area movement, individual capital ships, individual leaders, battle line resolutions, and rolling sixes to hit, and then diverges significantly to reflect the sailing warship era situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game for the English player is to destroy the naval forces of the  European Powers player and prevent them from obtaining control of vital sea areas around the world.  The object of the game for the European Powers player is to escape the forces of the English player and obtain temporary sea control of vital areas to support the continental and colonial objectives of various European nations.  The game uses over 650 counters, a two piece map, and numerous organization cards and play aid sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Product Information&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complexity: 4 out of 10&lt;br/&gt;    Solitaire Suitability: 7 out of 10&lt;br/&gt;    Time Scale: Yearly turns&lt;br/&gt;    Map Scale: Area&lt;br/&gt;    Unit Scale: individuals ship&lt;br/&gt;    Players: 2 or solitaire&lt;br/&gt;    Playing Time: 3-4 hours hours&lt;br/&gt;    Designer: Stephen Newberg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two 22 X 34 inch maps&lt;br/&gt;    Six Countersheets &amp;ndash; approximately 600 counter&lt;br/&gt;    One Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;    Rules and Scenario book&lt;br/&gt;    Player Aid Cards&lt;br/&gt;    Dice&lt;br/&gt;    One Box and Lid set&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
