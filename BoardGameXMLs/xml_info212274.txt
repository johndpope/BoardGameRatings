			<description>Jewels, jewels everywhere!  You should utilize limited action with intelligence; consider to make maximum advantage.  Compete with others, get all jewels, a few of them, or just monopolize one.  Think Craftily, act cleverly, and be the master of the jewels!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game of card placement and land acquisition for 3-6 players.  Have the highest bets on land to claim the jewels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to collect jewels from Land Plates to meet the victory conditions. Jewels are of different types and values. On your turn, take or bet a number card or token, or take and place land cards and jewels. When a round is complete, players will assess their total numbers of their bets on land cards with the winner taking the jewels. The game ends when a player either has 10 points from one type of jewel or 3 points of value from each different jewel type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
