							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Receptionists</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Receptionists players compete to reach as much money as possible by checking in guests and selling them extra services. Each player is a receptionist and their goal is the same. Once the guest deck is empty the game is finished and whoever collected the most money wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the players take turns in the reception each player can intervene by playing Challenge cards to stall the progress of other players, who can counter these with Rescue cards. You gain these cards by spending action points which are also used for checking in guests and selling extra services and you can get them depending on which type of guest you choose to check in the hotel. There are Penniless, Fishy, Lovely and Rich guests each with their own abilities and available money. The guests also have preferences in terms of rooms and extra services. In case a guest doesn't like the room you choose for him/her they might get offended which will cost you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will contain the following parts:&lt;br/&gt;one large board, &lt;br/&gt;5 decks of cards (Guest cards, Room cards, Challenge cards, Rescue cards and Extra services cards), &lt;br/&gt;4 receptionist figures, &lt;br/&gt;48 coloured wooden discs for each player (action points), &lt;br/&gt;4 dice, &lt;br/&gt;a rule booklet &lt;br/&gt;20 playing money notes of each type (500, 100, 50, 10).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
