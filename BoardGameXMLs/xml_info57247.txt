							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Trouble With Friends</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Trouble with Friends is a Side Lines adventure for the Hahlmabrea role playing game. Side lines consist of three to five small adventures that can be played in one or two gaming sessions. Side Lines are theme oriented; an underlying plot allows the adventures to be played either individually or as one long (campaign style) adventure. 81de Lines can be used in three distinct manners: 1) they can be played with any fantasy game system; 2) they can be played more than once (even with the same group); 3) they are a supplement for Hahlmabrea as well as an adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Terror of the Mines&amp;quot; is set in a small mining community that has more than its share of problems. The Adventurers are tasked with accomplishing ten very difficult Jobs, from killing the &amp;quot;creature&amp;quot; to stopping a violent group of smugglers. During the course of the adventure, the Adventurers will discover the real &amp;quot;terror&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;Carts, Horses, Sore Feet, and the Princess&amp;quot; the Adventurers must escort a beautiful, young princess through two war-torn kingdoms. Things go wrong, are misplaced, lost and even distorted, but the strong bind of honour, pride, and friendship will endure in this often hilarious adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A Penny a Day&amp;quot; finds the Adventurers chasing a small trinket that has a mind of Its own. The Adventurers must overcome many obstacles such as a strange, secret society, a high priestess that refuses to cooperate, and an apathetic village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A lone mountain Is engulfed in a mysterious, dark cloud; the Adventurers must discover what is causing the cloud, and if possible, remove this possible threat. The &amp;quot;Secret of the Ksrand Mountain&amp;quot; may prove to be more dangerous than anyone had ever Imagined. The constellation of Mallo-Mak may aid the Adventurers, but who can save them from what lies on top or even under the mountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
