Unfortunately for you, you are not the only one building towers, and other real estate moguls will do everything in their power to stop you. Can you battle the odds, the elements, and worst of all, the other players to come out on top with the tallest tower?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play:&lt;br/&gt;Contract Conquest &amp;ndash; The Chaotic Conquistadors is a card based tower building game for 2 or more players which can take as little as 30 minutes and can be expanded on to increase the play time up to 2 hours.
