			<description>This undated Chad Valley title is a dexterity game using a wood and metal spring launcher, a hollow celluloid ball, and five target birds, also hollow celluloid, that balance on a wire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box is used as the base for the target. A cardboard cutout of a row of trees, ranging from 6&amp;quot; to 8&amp;quot; high, is inserted into two wooden holders fixed at the front of the box. Two 10&amp;quot; wooden poles are inserted in two other wooden blocks fixed to the box near the back, and have a string running between them. The birds are balanced on the string, and players must shoot over the trees to hit the birds. Any number of rounds may be played, with the player having the biggest bag winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instructions inside the box lid show that three other versions of the game were produced: the smallest with just a cardboard backdrop, a larger square version with four poles and strings, and a huge octagonal version with eight poles in two squares at different heights, shown with 21 birds perches and more fallen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
