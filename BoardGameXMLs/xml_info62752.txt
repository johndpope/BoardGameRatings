			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perched high in the Mountains of Gil&amp;rsquo;Hagh-Eth, the Castle of Duke De&amp;rsquo;Ath broods in perpetual darkness. Of the fabled Duke, little is known. Born the seventh son of a seventh son, to King Constantine IV, the Duke fell into dark ways, stumbling along the uncharted dark paths of black magic, and losing his soul to the evils he surrounded himself with.  Few who enter the castle are ever seen again. Those who have ventured within and escaped alive speak of madness, horror and beastly things of which they will not utter. However, chambers piled high with valuable baubles and gold squat amongst the grim ruins of the sprawling castle, tempting thieves, warriors and wizards to enter the castle, risking all for a taste of treasure and magical power. Will you be next?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suitability - 1 character of any level max 160 Personal Adds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
