			<description>[Executive Order 134340: Full-scale retreat from the combat zone, effective at 0800 tomorrow. All soldiers unable to return on army helicopters will be considered MIA and no evacuation support given past the 0800 deadline tomorrow.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One half-mile separates you and your comrades from a one-way ticket back to the homeland. There's a problem though: you're going through a minefield. It's not so bad though, your squadron planted the mines, so everyone knows where at least the mines they placed are. Working together to plan a route through the field should get you safely across&amp;hellip; except the helicopter has room for only one of you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Claymore is a card-driven race game in which players are traversing a field littered with mines. Some mine locations are known and controlled by the player, but most are not. Players must utilize cards and their own observational talent in order to cross the board safely, and hope that their opponents' men detonate landmines, pushing them back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
