			<description>Eurooppa-peli [Finnish for &amp;quot;The Europe-Game&amp;quot;] is an educational party game. It combines a simple roll-and-move mechanic with trivia. Players move their pawns around a map depicting the 2006 member states of the European Union. After each move the players answer questions arranged in five broad topics: A) The EU; B) sport; C) history &amp;amp; geography; D) art, science and technology; and E) society, nature &amp;amp; culture. For a correct answer the player receives an EU-flag within that topic. After collecting ten flags (two flags of each topic A-E) the player heads for goal and wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This seems a very simple game that has its primary purpose in teaching matters concerning the EU with European history and culture. The components of the game are nice and look professional enough, but there is very little to call a design here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
