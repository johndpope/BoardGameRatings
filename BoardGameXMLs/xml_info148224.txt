			<description>When the name of the game is horror; SLASHER will leave you in stitches!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SLASHER is a game of dark humor which concerns itself with the slice-n-dice brand of horror film that seems to be so popular in today's cinema. The game centers on the making of a film about an evil Slasher who is plaguing the fraternities of a college campus. The players, who each represent one of the besieged fraternities, provide the action and plot twists to our ill fated story. The winner of the game emerges as the hero-/heroine of our spine chilling, shriek filled, gore-o-matic tale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
