			<description>Cheese is a game of observation and quick reflexes.&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a card depicting a slice of cheese. At the same time, each player tries to be the first to complete its scheme: to do this you have to quickly take the pieces on the table and place them on the card, making them fit with the pattern depicted on the card.&lt;br/&gt;The player who successfully complete the scheme first, takes the 3D piece of cheese in the middle of the table: he earns the pieces of cheese taken and draws a cat card.&lt;br/&gt;The cat cards are penalties to be applied in the next round. Examples: use only one hand, use only thumb and forefinger, do not bend your elbows.&lt;br/&gt;When the cheese cards end, the game ends: the player who earned more pieces of cheese wins.&lt;br/&gt;The rules provides various game modes, with different levels of difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
