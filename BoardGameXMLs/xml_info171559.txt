							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Eighth Doctor Sourcebook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Celebrating the 50th anniversary of Doctor Who, this Sourcebook explores the Eighth Doctor&amp;rsquo;s adventures on Earth and beyond. With detailed information on all the allies, enemies, aliens and gadgets that he encounters, as well as examining each of his adventures, the book contains a wealth of material for the Doctor Who: Adventures in Time and Space RPG, and is also a fact-packed resource for fans of the show!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After being shot in a gang war in San Francisco, the Doctor regenerates just in time to stop the Master one more time. His eighth incarnation had much to contend with, not least the Time War, during which he had a fateful encounter with the Sisterhood of Karn once more. As well as detailing the Eighth Doctor&amp;rsquo;s adventures, this sourcebook also contains a complete campaign &amp;ndash; The Doom of the Daleks &amp;ndash; that sees the Doctor&amp;rsquo;s deadliest foe erasing him from existence, forcing his companions into a race against time itself to save him!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is the Doctor, but probably not the one you were expecting.&amp;quot; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
