			<description>Prepare For Battle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beams of coherent light slice through the ships hull as her captain barks out orders to his crew. We're not out of this yet, all stop, bring us about and ready all forward batteries to fire on my mark... Fire!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Firing Solution is a table top fleet level tactical space combat and campaign game where player field fleets of ships, sending them into battle against their enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highlights:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Space combat your way... In two or three dimensions on hex grids or measured using any flat playing surface, all without complicated rules or math.&lt;br/&gt;     Easily field fleets of ships in battle using any of the 30+ included ships or quickly design your own using the included construction rules.&lt;br/&gt;     Damage types and defenses use a rock / paper / scissors approach with each damage type having an appropriate defense. Empires may specialize in particular technologies but no single vessel can excel at everything.&lt;br/&gt;     Tactical Data Link squadrons, Escorts, other special equipment and ship orders add considerable depth to fleet tactics.&lt;br/&gt;     Command an empire in its struggle for galactic dominance with the included campaign system based on colony control and infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;     The combination of ship elevation and roll status with directional defenses, individual weapon firing arcs and dorsal, ventral or spinal mounting options bring 3D battlefields to life without vectors or other complex math.&lt;br/&gt;     Enhance weapons by adding various weapon effects such as barrage, slow arming or spinal mount to alter their capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;     Unique damage system scales the severity of each weapon attack allowing larger vessels to dispatch small ships more easily while smaller vessels need to wear down larger targets with repeated strikes.&lt;br/&gt;     Use one of the four included Empires or create your own using a simple system allowing the creation of empires tailored to your favorite setting.&lt;br/&gt;     And Much More.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Format:&lt;br/&gt;68 Page PDF with Separate Front/Back Cover PDF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.wargamedownloads.com/item.php?item=583&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.wargamedownloads.com/item.php?item=583&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
