							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pyramid (Volume 3, Issue 21 - Jul 2010)</name>
									
			<description>Where the glow of neon and chrome meet the cacophony of corporate corruption, a near-future of adventure awaits. This month, Pyramid - the PDF magazine for roleplayers - sends its information insurgents to scope out cyberpunk. This issue includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Console Cowboys and Cyberspace Kung Fu,&amp;quot; new rules for cinematic hacking that build on the foundation of GURPS Action  to deliver high-octane electronic exploits. The article includes pre-built cyberdecks (with rules to design your own), a dozen programs to assist netrunners, and a full system to tie them all together. Although designed with cyberpunk in mind, these rules are also excellent to represent modern-day cinematic hacking.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Down in the Mall,&amp;quot; a way to generate random cyberpunk shopping centers with the roll of a few dice. Written by Matt Riggsby, author of GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 8: Treasure Tables, this article uses the techniques from that volume to generate quick spending spots.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;The Treasure of Joni Monorail,&amp;quot; a cyberpunk adventure suitable for any near-future system or setting. A musical martyr's enigmatic message from the grave sends the heroes out of the safety of the city and into the unknown - the grittier no-man's land between metropolises where even the corporations' powers are unsure.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;The Voices in My Head,&amp;quot; a collection of new GURPS Ultra-Tech chips that can provide the encouragement, motivation, and assistance needed to keep you cool amid a chaotic chrome culture.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Keeping It Real,&amp;quot; an examination of how to maintain realism while permitting toned-down versions of cinematic GURPS advantages and disadvantages. No, you can't take Danger Sense or Hard to Kill in a realistic game - but you can get close. Although written with an eye toward cyberpunk, this article is an excellent resource for groups who love realism but want to keep character-creation options as open as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, this Pyramid includes an &amp;quot;Action Cyberdeck&amp;quot; prop designed to aid the new netrunning rules presented in this issue, plus the usual futuristic features: Murphy's Rules with Greg Hyland; Steven Marsh's Random Thought Table; and other odds and ends. Buy this issue today, before the megacorps decide you shouldn't have it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
