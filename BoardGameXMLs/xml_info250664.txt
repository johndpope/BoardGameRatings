			<description>Godtear is a fast-paced, high-action combat game for two players, in which each player takes their warband of Champions and Followers and battles rival warbands for control of the precious Godtears scattered across the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Godtear has been carefully designed to be quick to learn and throws players straight into the action and also offers a huge depth of options and tactics to explore. With innovative and organic scenario mechanics, no two games of Godtear are ever the same. The aftermath of each game will leave you wanting to play again and again; there&amp;rsquo;s huge replayability for players experimenting with different Champion selections and play styles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Champions progress and grow in power as you play through a narrative campaign, further customizing your gameplay experience. Built from the ground up for narrative driven campaign style play, Godtear also offers balance and clarity of rules for highly competitive tournament play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;Godtear is a scenario driven game. Each scenario has its own rules, but there are common rules that form the basis of all scenarios. Each scenario uses the scoring system below in addition to its unique scenario rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each hex utilized by a scenario will be clearly indicated in the rules for the scenario. These hexes are known as Objective Hexes. Champions may move through Objective Hexes freely. Followers cannot enter Objective Hexes (unless they have a special rule that is an exception to this limitation).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During each turn of Godtear, players compete to influence the momentum of battle, allowing them to gain the upper hand. This is represented by moving the Turn Token on the Battle Ladder closer to that player&amp;rsquo;s Warband Token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are the ways a player can influence the tide of battle and move the Turn Token closer to their own Warband Token:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Cull: Deliver a knockout blow to one enemy Follower 1 step&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Conquer: Deliver a knockout blow to one enemy Champion 4 steps&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Claim: Place one friendly banner on an Objective Hex 1 step&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Capture: Have one friendly banner on an Objective Hex during the End phase 4 steps for each banner&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Crush: Remove one enemy banner from the board by moving a friendly Champion into its hex 1 step&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the turn, the player with the Turn Token in their half of the Battle Ladder wins the turn and gains the number of Victory Points shown on the reverse side of that turn&amp;rsquo;s Turn Token. Turns increase in value as the action intensifies and then taper off again as the battle nears its conclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to have 5 Victory Points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
