							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Granny&#039;s Gumption II: The Revenge of Manton Dwool</name>
									
			<description>A One-Round Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The retirement community of Sunny Acres has been a bit more open since your return from rescuing your grandchildren last year. The cottages are still rather small, er, that is to say SNUG, yes, snug. The entertainment still leaves a lot to be desired, and the supplies available in the community center store are still exceedingly bland. However, Miss Gusspen, after she recovered from her nervous breakdown, has taken to wearing a colored ribbon in her hair to offset her starched white outfits; and the guards, er, the interns have treated you with considerably more respect after you laid out eight or twelve of them for a week while on your way out to rescue your grandchildren.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
