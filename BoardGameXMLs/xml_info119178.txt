			<description>Lupin the 3rd: Treasure of the Sorcerer King (ルパン三世 魔術王の遺産 Rupan Sansei Majutsu-Ou no Isan, Lupin the Third: The Legacy of the Magic King) is an stealth/action video game from Bandai. It has an original story based on the anime series Lupin III.&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay relies heavily on stealth and the use of various disguises and is displayed from a third person perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lupin is out to steal a pair of antique pitchers which will supposedly show the way to the legendary treasure of King Randolph II. The mysterious Theodore Hannewald is planning to display them at an exhibition at his ancestral castle in Goldengasse (a European city heavily inspired by Prague), but might have something more in mind. In any case, he doesn't want them stolen and has put Inspector Zenigata in charge of security.  Also, young Theresa Faust, the owner of the pitchers, seems to be troubled by something - and it's not like Lupin to desert a fair maiden in distress!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Lupin the 3rd: Treasure of the Sorcerer King&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
