			<description>Spherewalker Sourcebook is the first major supplement for Everway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Apex Soulsinger drew her knife and buried it in her own heart. Her scream of death rang across the land, and it rang across a thousand spheres as a gate opened in her flesh. Although its outline bore the shape of their ally and friend, it seemed to have within it the brilliance of the sun. It began to flicker with the views of countless worlds.... Realizing that their lives were to be bought with her death, the legion charged into the gate. Countless worlds flashed through the gate, shimmering like reflections on a pond when ripples collide. One soldier would step through into a jungle, while the next would arrive in a desert, and another would find herself in a distant city...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;-- Spherewalker Sourcebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breathtaking tales, mysterious peoples, exotic worlds: such is the landscape of Spherewalker Sourcebook. The Spherewalker Sourcebook is the perfect reference tool for gamemasters and players of the Everway game system, as well as excellent reading for those who enjoy fantastic yarns set in a richly embellished multiverse. Experience the power and diversity of a thousand possibilities as you embark on your journey as a spherewalker!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Covering the range of views from the mundane... to the cosmic, Greg shows that his imagination works at any scale, whether he's talking about the effects of wearing brown or the origin of humanity. This range of attention allows the reader, player, or gamemaster to see the grand scope... as well as the day-to-day details... Greg's heavy use of dialogue, the first-person accounts, his humor, and his sense of drama make the sourcebook an easy read.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;--Jonathan Tweet, Everway Game Designer&lt;br/&gt;from the foreward&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
