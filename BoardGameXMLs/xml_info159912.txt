			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asteroil is the game of space mining. Into the vast reaches of the solar system two players maneuver the space fleets of competing corporations as they vie for the immeasurable wealth contained in the asteroids. Repulse cruisers hyperspace in and out to gain position while the space refineries close in fast. The company that meets its quota first gets the jump on the market to control the world's supply of platinum, titanium and gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asteroil is an abstract strategy game played on a 12x12 square grid. Each player controls a space refinery and four repulse cruisers. A turn consists of moving a piece one space in any direction, jumping a cruiser in or out of hyperspace (off the board; jumping in allows the cruiser to go to any space), or firing a cruiser's repulsion beam at an asteroid. The beam causes the asteroid to move away from the cruiser; ideally the player's space refinery is on the other side of the asteroid, allowing it to be captured. The player who manages to capture three of the six asteroids wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
