			<description>Worlds to Explore&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction (From the credits page)&lt;br/&gt;Nebuleon is an expression of the desire to explore. It was always a game for me to make up something different - a world, an abandoned space ship, a base - and have players unravel its secrets... Nebuleon comes with a complete setting, but it has always been our intention to make the iridium system and nebuleon easily customisable to any setting. There is no epic metaplot running the the background that is required to make the game fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Detailed Setting (From the back of the book)&lt;br/&gt;The Nebuleon core rules contains a complete setting including nine races and their sub-races, their worlds, their governments and all the interstellar orginizations. There is still enough room for you to expand and build your own races, worlds and campaigns. Nebuleon was designed with customization in mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Complete Game (From the back of the book)&lt;br/&gt;This is the only book you need to play Nebuleon. The game system, setting and all reference material is contained here for complete campaigns or short adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
