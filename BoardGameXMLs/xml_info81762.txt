			<description>Witch Bibi Blocksberg has been naughty, so her witching utensils have been thrown into a pond. The players have to help her to retrieve the items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bibi's items (colored chips) are placed on the board (in the pond). The black chips are placed next to the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The active player rolls two color dice. If a die shows white, the player loses a turn. If a die shows black, the player takes a black chip. In all other cases, the player can either take two chips in the color that he/she rolled, or all the chips between two chips of the right colors. If there is no more chip of a color rolled, the player has to place one of his/her own chips on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the last black chip has been taken, the game ends. The player who has retrieved most items is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
