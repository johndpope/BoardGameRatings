			<description>This is a dexterity/skill game for children involving the placement of ladybug pieces on the leaves of a palm tree.  The palm tree leaves (fronds?) have various colored circles on them in rows from closest to the trunk to farthest away from the trunk.  The tree leaves have some degree of movement, and if too much weight is placed on them, they will dip or bend down.  Players take turn rolling a dice with various colored sides, and then placing a ladybug piece on a matching colored circle on a leaf.  The goal of the game is to get rid of all your ladybugs, but if your placement causes ladybugs to fall, those pieces become yours.  The game continues until one player is out of ladybugs. The leaves have different lengths and there are three sizes of ladybugs (small, medium and large), so there is some definite strategy about which ladybug gets placed where.  The tree, leaves, and ladybugs are all nicely formed and painted wooden pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
