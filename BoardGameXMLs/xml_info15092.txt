							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Shuttle 101</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Command actual missions into outer space for the benefit of mankind.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome crew members, to the Space Shuttle Program. You are about to command the Space Shuttle on missions to Earth orbit and beyond. The object of the missions is to use the benefits of space to help people on Earth - to improve the quality of life for all mankind. The challenge is great and the vehicle is worthy, but it is up to you to decide how the missions can best be completed, handle emergencies as they arise, and manage your supplies - propellant and consumables - during the voyage. The propellant provides the power for your vehicle, the consumables are the food, water, and oxygen for the crew members. The more missions you complete and the more difficult they are, the more points you will accumulate. Your crew ranking can advance from Payload Specialist to Mission Specialist, Pilot, and finally Commander.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to score points by completing missions in space with varying degrees of difficulty. The player who completes missions as quickly as possible and uses as few supplies as possible will score highest. The player with the most points when any player completes five missions is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
