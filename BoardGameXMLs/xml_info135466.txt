			<description>Chasing Rabbits, The Card Game is a trick-taking style card game where the object is to be the first player to 500 points when playing with 3 or more players or with 2 players the highest score after going through the deck once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;the game is played in rounds where the players play positive &amp;quot;Rabbits&amp;quot; or negative &amp;quot;Rabbit hole&amp;quot; point cards and multiplier &amp;quot;Hutch&amp;quot; cards into a communal hand, until a &amp;quot;Chasing Rabbits&amp;quot; card is played to claim the hand. Unless a &amp;quot;Jack Rabbit&amp;quot; trump card is played the player of the &amp;quot;Chasing rabbits&amp;quot; card wins the hand, and then calculates the score. Score is kept on notebook paper (not provided).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chasing Rabbits is as much fun for adults as kids (ages 7+) and guaranteed to bring out the 'kid' in you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
