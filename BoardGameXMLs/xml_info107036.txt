							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Startrek + Towers of Brahma</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Startrek + Towers of Brahma is a compilation of the aforementioned games that were never released solely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Startrek, The Federation star ships are rebelling! You, as the commander of the star ship Enterprise, must find out why and stop the mutiny. As you enter the quarantine zone of 1000 stars, you realize that the rogue star ships are not the sole problem you are going to face. The Klingons, aliens, as well as a host of other surprises will call for the liberal use of your phasers and photon torpedoes. Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scott, Sulu, Chekov and Uhura, will all be there to assist you with their expert advice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Towers of Brahma is a mind boggling puzzle in which you have to transfer various sized rings along three posts. Your limitation is that you must transfer only one ring at a time and no ring may cover another of a smaller size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
