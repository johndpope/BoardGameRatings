			<description>designer summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game for 2 or 3 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a desert planet with two suns, a pair of alien teenagers, a curious reptilian and a somewhat irritable ursid, awaken to find that they have vague memories of one another but not much else. As they try to discover what has left them stranded in the desert, they unearth a treacherous secret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME MECHANICS:&lt;br/&gt;This game is based on the core rules of Platformer RPG. To play the game, the players will need three eight-sided dice (3D8), and the starting character sheets provided for Gizmo and Krash, along with pencils to adjust stats during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has players acting as both the Platform Master and the character of their choice. All that is necessary to switch roles with your ally is to declare &amp;ldquo;Tag&amp;rdquo;, at which point, the player becomes the Platform Master and vice-versa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gizmo and Krash is a story-driven game. You can tell the story however you wish, as the Platform Master, so long as the story is coherent and fun for both players. Behind the door there may be an alien monster waiting to get out, or there may be a teleportation chamber ready to take you to another world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
