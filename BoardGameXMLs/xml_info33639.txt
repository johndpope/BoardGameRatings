							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sun Board Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Play the game based on Britain's favourite newspaper.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a promo game for the UK tabloid, The Sun, and Virgin Mobile. Players are competing to edit the best version of the Sun, by first moving their journalist around the board to chase stories and then editing a version of the paper from the cards in their hands in a print run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stories fall in four categories (News, Sport, Features and Bizarre) and Editor's Choice (a kind of event/joker) and each edition must contain enough stories from each category. Categories are subdivided into sets of stories from the same news item. A few ads for Virgin Mobile are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the print runs, players place cards (stories) in front of them, one by one, and thus have a chance to select what stories they publish depending on their opponent's choices, and also affect the game with their Editor's Choices. Scoring is based on how many stories they have from the same set, if they have an exclusive of the news item, or if they were able to ruin another player's exclusive by also publishing a story from their set. The ads also score points. The player with the most points after the 4th print run wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
