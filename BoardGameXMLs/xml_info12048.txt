							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">White House</name>
									
			<description>A game that attempts to capture the essence of the upcoming 1972 election &amp;quot;from the state primaries to Election Day&amp;quot;. Campaign buttons from Muskie, Rockefeller, Lindsey, Wallace, and other also-rans join those of Nixon and McGovern on the cover. Players vie for the support of various states in the &amp;quot;primaries&amp;quot;, then compare totals in the &amp;quot;election&amp;quot;. Because players must reduce their hand for the election to the number held by the player who won the fewest states, White House is at best a game that reinforces the &amp;quot;focus on the largest states to win&amp;quot; view. At worst, it is a race for California. Still, by using the candidates of the time, it provides a window into the 1972 election.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
