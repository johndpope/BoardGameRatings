			<description>This is a game put out by Bayer in support of their Advantage anti-flea product.  There's no way to translate some puns.  The German word for flea is &amp;quot;Floh&amp;quot; so mentally toss in a flea reference every time you see &amp;quot;Floh&amp;quot; in the summary below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rough translation from the rules introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For years King Flohrian the Fourth has sat upon the throne in Flohrida.  Villainously he bleeds his people dry, living like a sponge and having the time of his life settling down in every suitable nook.  But now here come five players who are going to take matters up with him.  A rebellion will be plotted.  A new battle cry echoes from a thousand throats through the alleys of the capital city Flohrenz: &amp;quot;Long Live the Reflohlution!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;Palace of King Flohrian IV&lt;br/&gt;5 reflohlutionaries&lt;br/&gt;1 flea king&lt;br/&gt;25 blue Flohkus-Pokus cards&lt;br/&gt;25 red Reflohlution cards&lt;br/&gt;1 die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
