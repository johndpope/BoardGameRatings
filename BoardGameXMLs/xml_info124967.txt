							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Small Piece of the Sun</name>
									
			<description>Gamechef 2012 Finalist&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Storytelling game where players may have asymmetrical roles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction: &lt;br/&gt;It is a dark, cold, hungry time. The First People are sick unto death. Their cousin, Coyote, hears their lamentations and wishes to grant them succor. He knows a place to find the cure to the ills that plague them. He can bring them a small piece of the sun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the Elemental Totems do not wish for Coyote to succeed; should he bring fire down from the mount the balance of the elements would forever be thrown off. Yet despite their abhorrence of his endeavor, Armadillo, Beaver and Crow are bound by sacred law to aid Coyote if he follows the ancient rituals. But can such a trickster ever really follow any such edicts? If he fails to, the First People are surely doomed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But even if he succeeds the First People may be doomed. Fire is a dangerous gift, one suited both to create and destroy. If Coyote lets his foolishness outweigh his wisdom he may doom the First People even as he saves them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
