			<description>Arkanoid Returns is an arcade game released by Taito in 1997 as part of the Arkanoid series. It was the fourth overall, and third to be released in arcades. The game was since ported to the PlayStation, with an updated home release being released afterwards titled Arkanoid R 2000. All versions were released exclusively in Japan, currently making it the only game in the series to never receive an international release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The enemy known as 'DOH' still did not get the message and after many years of silence decides to attack once again. The 'Vaus' space vessel better be ready to face new, yet familiar challenges, in order to stop 'DOH' once again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay remains similar to Arkanoid: Doh it Again, the previous game in the series released for the Super Nintendo, in that it features the same powerups (with the addition of the brown &amp;quot;G&amp;quot; Giga Ball), some re-used level designs, and the same board size. The initial arcade game contains only 50 levels, the environment changing every 9 levels. Unlike past Arkanoid titles, Returns has no bosses to confront. The R 2000 re-release adds 150 additional stages, bringing the total to 200, with bosses on levels 100, 199, and 200. This release also contained a level editor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Arkanoid Returns&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
