			<description>Fantastic and addictive game. 1-4 players. Normal game mode, map mode, and challenge mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: Defeat gold dragon and conquer the magic land with holy runes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenge mode: No map needed. Each player is level 4, and equips 6 runes and 6 scrolls randomly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brief Game Rules:&lt;br/&gt;Beginning: each player chooses role card and its side (light or dark), and takes 1 rune and 1 scroll randomly. Next, put the pawn on the battle map (Wasteland-Start Cell) and is Level 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Process: the active player rolls a dice and moves on the battle map from start cell to Boss cell to fight the boss. When passing Boss cell, the player may choose to challenge the boss or return to the Start cell. When winning the challenge, the player goes to the next map and upgrade one Level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle with monster: player starts first. The player may choose to use ability, rune or scroll in each turn. Ability can only be used once each battle and may be played anytime; only 1 rune can be played in each turn, and tap the rune after its effect (taped rune cannot be used in the same battle unless returned to hand); only 1 scroll can be played in each turn, and remove the scroll from game after its effect. The monster attacks secondly. Choose a monster attack card each turn to activate monster action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle with player: opposing side players can attack each other when their pawns placed in the same cell. Any player can challenge another player when the pawn placed in the Battle Field Cell. The attacker plays first. Each player may use ability, rune and scroll to attack the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team with player: same side players can make team when their pawns placed in the same cell. When they attack monster as a team, monster uses the different monster attack card to each team member. When they are attacked by opposing side player, their team status is broken, and the opponent may choose to attack each team member separately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cool Factors:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Normal game mode, map mode, and challenge mode&lt;br/&gt;    Strategic battle with abilities, runes, and scrolls&lt;br/&gt;    Dark and Light camp, Team mode, and Battle Arena&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
