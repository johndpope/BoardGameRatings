							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sufficiently Advanced  Demo</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a demo for the roleplaying game Sufficiently Advanced. That means that it&amp;rsquo;s a shortened version of the game, with as much awesome as we could pack into 11% of the full book&amp;rsquo;s page count. On its own this document is a playable game, but it&amp;rsquo;s not the full story by any means. Consider it a free taste.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game reaches for the outermost limits of what we think is achievable. Grounded in hard science, but speculating incredible advances, Sufficiently Advanced (or S.A. for short) looks at a future in which nanotechnology, computing, medicine, and other fields have advanced to the limit of our current understanding &amp;mdash; and just a bit beyond. It&amp;rsquo;s a look at what these technologies might do to the world and what societies might form around them. It is a game about responsibility and the drive for a better future. It is a game fundamentally about humanity, as well as some of its descendants. Most importantly, it&amp;rsquo;s a game of exploration and political machination set in a universe where everyone has nearly godlike capabilities at their disposal &amp;mdash; and the world wasn't destroyed by it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
