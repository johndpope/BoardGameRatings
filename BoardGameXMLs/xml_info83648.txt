			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Radiant Historia is a Japanese RPG developed for the Nintendo DS. The game is set in the fantasy world of Vainguer, a land engulfed in a war between the nations of Alistel and Granorg. The entire world is slowly becoming a desert, and each country fights for what little habitable land remains. The game's protagonist is an Alistelan intelligence officer named Stocke, who at the outset is defeated and almost killed by one of Granorg's commanders.  He is saved by a mysterious artifact in his possession known as the White Chronicle, which transports him to realm called Historia. From there, he discovers that he can travel backward and forward in time to alter his actions at critical points in the game's narrative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game adheres closely to JRPG genre conventions, although all enemy encounters are visible as the player explores and most can be engaged or avoided at will. The player can shift between the past and future, and their actions in the past will alter the situation in later time periods. The battle screen is a 3x3 combat grid that emphasizes strategy, and the visuals present 2D characters on a 3D background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
