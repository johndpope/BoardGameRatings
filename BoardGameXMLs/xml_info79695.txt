			<description>In 1983, Tang produced the third title in the series, Horace And The Spiders. This was primarily a platform game, although the sprites had been retained from the top-view of the first two games. The first level sees Horace climbing a hill while jumping over spiders. The second level involves crossing a bridge by swinging on spider threads. The third level is the final confrontation with the spiders - he must create holes in the web, luring the spiders into the holes to fix them and consequently jumping on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the earlier two titles, this game was only released for the ZX Spectrum. The first stage of this game shared similarities with both Pitfall and the Colecovision game Smurf: Rescue in Gargamel's Castle, whilst the third platform stage is essentially a Space Panic clone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungry_Horace#Hungry_Horace,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungry_Horace#Hungry_Horace,&amp;qu...&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
