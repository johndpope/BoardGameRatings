			<description>Marrak Hesh 17 is a mini-game composed by a board, 26 goods tokens, 26 tranportation tokens, 2 2-players boards, 3 3-players boards, 3 corporation tokens and 10 &amp;quot;deep space&amp;quot; cards.&lt;br/&gt;At his turn a player places one transport token on a free space on the board representing an &amp;quot;orbital souk&amp;quot; and takes the corrisponding good. The taken good must be placed on the player board ortogonally adjacent to his others goods. The game ends when all players can't take goods from the board. &lt;br/&gt;Every player scores points for the biggest gruop of goods of the same type and the biggest group of goods of the same colour. Some goods give bonus points and in the advanced variant also the &amp;quot;deep space&amp;quot; cards add points for different conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
