			<description>America's 10 Most Wanted, released as Fugitive Hunter: War on Terror in the US was mainly received negatively due to its dated graphics and uninspired boss battles. It contains tracks and cameos by members of So Solid Crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in the present, the game places the player into the role of Jake Seaver, a CIFR agent. Travelling to locations such as Utah, Paris, and Miami, the game finalises in Afghanistan, where the player must capture Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden. The game contains 10 levels, one for each fugitive respectively, as well as a preceding introductory level.  The game is a typical first person shooter, featuring arcade-style, third person fights as means of capturing the level-in-question's fugitive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;America's 10 Most Wanted (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
