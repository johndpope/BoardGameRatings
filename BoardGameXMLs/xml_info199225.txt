			<description>A historical military strategy game set in the era of the Crusades. 2-4 players compete to occupy and rule the cities and castles of the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. &lt;br/&gt;After setting up the armies, players take turns in moving their different units (infantry, cavalry, archers, sultans and kings, to name a few), on the map, across cities, castles and lands. &lt;br/&gt;Battles occur when two players occupy the same area. Battle and Strategy cards help add some strategy to this dice-based game.&lt;br/&gt;As they occupy and rule these castles, cities and/or lands, players collect cards and accumulate points. Points are used to purchase new units or pay ransom for captured units in battle. &lt;br/&gt;The player with the most city and castle cards wins, after a predetermined number of rounds has been played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
