			<description>With just a simple set of cards and coins, uncover your friends&amp;rsquo; dirtiest experiences and socially unacceptable thoughts while maintaining complete anonymity. Drawing inspiration from Korea&amp;rsquo;s rampant drinking game culture, this raunchy board game will transform any stale party into an unforgettable night bursting with laughter. If your mind is constantly flooded with naughty thoughts, this is the game for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- HOW TO PLAY --&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.Starting with the youngest player in the group, players take turns drawing 2 cards from the question card deck.&lt;br/&gt;2.The player chooses which of the cards to ask the group and discards the unused question card.&lt;br/&gt;3.Each player answers the question by putting &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;No&amp;rdquo; answer coin into the secret box in the middle of the table. Don&amp;rsquo;t let other players see your answer, this should be anonymous! &lt;br/&gt;4.After all players have placed a &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;No&amp;rdquo; coin into the secret box, the players choose a guessing card from their hand to match the number of &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo; coins that they think the group has placed into the box. The player places their guessing card face down.&lt;br/&gt;5.All players flip their guessing cards at the same time to show the group.&lt;br/&gt;6.Open the secret box and count the number of &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo; coins inside. Any player that chose the correct number guessing card gets one point and moves their Meeple to the next space on the score tracker. &lt;br/&gt;7.Repeat this process until someone reaches 5 points and becomes the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
