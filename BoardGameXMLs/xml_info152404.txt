							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sam Hain</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Reason for the Season...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Hot Chicks has seen some incredible things appear.  There have been demons and aliens, monsters and ninjas and robots of all kinds appearing to threaten the future and destiny of the human race.  It has seen the ascension of new gods and the transformation of the old.  Nothing that the world has seen, however, could have prepared anyone for who shows up on All Hallow's Eve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He is the doorway to death and the Afterlives.  He is the arbiter of karma, the passage to resurrection, and the holder of the keys that seperate the living from the underworld.  Once, he was merely a mechanic of the Universe, but he was given a name.  After untold thousands of years, the Earth has finally seen the arrival of Samhain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or &amp;quot;Sam,&amp;quot; as he occaisionally likes to be called.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bound with a body formed in the most advanced robotics laboratory in the world, the essence of Sam Hain brings the possibility of horrific destruction and terror on Halloween, his night.  Of course, if something isn't done to slow him down, every night might just become Halloween.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witness his arrival, see his incredible powers, and view the minions at his disposal.  New Cyberwear, New Powers, New Psionics, and New Merits and Flaws!  Includes modification packages for existing characters and NPCs so that those who have passed on can return as incredibly powerful undead, or as disembodied ghosts destined never again to touch the meterial world of the living!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
