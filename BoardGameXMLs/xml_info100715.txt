			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Echo Bazaar is a browser based game set in an alternate historical London that has been absorbed by the Bazaar, a travelling underground market run by its mysterious &amp;quot;Masters&amp;quot; who choose a city every so often to engulf into their universe of intrigue and danger.  Gameplay is built around a series of stats which are applied to everything, including special missions and other qualities.  The stats are raised by choosing an action, generally known as a &amp;quot;storylet&amp;quot;, from either a given location or from randomly drawn cards, which often involve a stat check to determine success or failure.  While the gameplay is simple and often repetitive, the focus is on the storylets and the long missions, known as &amp;quot;Ambitions&amp;quot;, that progress your character deeper into the world of the Bazaar.  Whether you succeed or fail, you will get to read an interesting tidbit describing your actions and the results that occur, and the farther you go, the more of this world you'll get to experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
