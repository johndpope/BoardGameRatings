			<description>Faerie Castles is a Rummy based card game.  Players compete to build castles in the lands of the fair-folk whilst trying to defend them against the various inhabitants roaming the faerie realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players collect cards that form the structure of their castles, which they may play down in front of themselves.  However when drawing new cards they may encounter the various creatures and peoples of the faerie realm who will try to attack and destroy the castles built there.  If defeated these attackers are imprisoned in the dungeons of the castles and add to  a players final score.  Should they be victorious the castle is destroyed and the players work begins again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artwork is presented in a black and white style to allow children to colour the cards themselves, individualizing their own copy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faerie Castles is an entry in the 2015 Children's Game Print and Play Contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
