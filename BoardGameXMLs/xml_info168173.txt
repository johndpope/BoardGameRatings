			<description>Help, I don&amp;rsquo;t know who I am!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amnesia is the fun new card game of lost identities and wacky faces. Players use a mix of memory and deduction to rediscover their identities. The first player to do so is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players each hold 4-5 cards in their hand. However, 1 of these cards is only visible to their opponents. The aim of the game is to successfully guess your hidden card (1 of 16 characters).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, players may ask any 1 opponent how many cards they hold of a particular type (hair colour or face type). Players must answer truthfully and out loud for everyone to hear. As information comes out, players can begin to deduce which character they are (or are not).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player thinks they know which character they are, they can make a guess. If they are correct, they win! If they are wrong, they are knocked out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
