			<description>In DragonHeist, 2 to 4 players are gold thieves, taking it in turns to plunder the sleeping dragon's hoard, pushing their luck to grab the most treasure, whilst trying not to wake the dragon!&lt;br/&gt;Once all the coins from the hoard have been stolen, the player with the most treasure wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TREASURES!&lt;br/&gt;Players roll 6 'Plunder Dice' to see what treasures they can collect - coins, keys, chests, or magic rings. If they finish their turn with any of these treasures they can claim them from the dragon's hoard. There are 3 magic rings to find that can protect players from dragonfire, silence their noise, or make them invisible!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE DRAGON FIGHTS BACK!&lt;br/&gt;Some dice rolled affect treasures &amp;ndash; the dragon can snatch them back, or they can be made too hot to hold by dragonfire. The dragon's tail or wing send coins flying around his lair, whilst rolling a dragon's eye means the dragon is starting to wake up, so best not roll any noise!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEFEATING THE DRAGON!&lt;br/&gt;If a player manages to collect all 3 magic rings, and they are brave enough, they can try to defeat the dragon! With all 3 magic rings, they cannot be seen or heard, and are protected from dragonfire! The 'Dragon Die' is rolled to see whether the player can defeat the dragon before all their gold is stolen back&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
