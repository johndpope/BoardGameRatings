							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Leaning Tower of Pisa</name>
									
			<description>Can you keep it from falling!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leaning Tower of Pisa is a stacking game.  Players first take turns adding pieces to construct the entire tower, then if it is still standing, pieces are removed one by one (not from the top level) until the tower collapses.  The loser is either the player who adds the piece which causes the tower to fall in the construction phase, or the player who removes the piece causing the collapse in the removal phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tower itself is made up of eight levels, each level having six pieces which can be removed, a central support piece and a flat 'floor' piece.  The full tower stands about 33cm tall (13in).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a sloping base piece which can be used for a more difficult challenge.  Starting with this piece means that the whole tower is on an angle (like the real Leaning Tower) and is much more unstable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
