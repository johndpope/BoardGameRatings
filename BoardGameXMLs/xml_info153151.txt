							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Capped Volcano</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 40 x 40 inch, full color floorplan of a Capped Volcano.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Hex, Square and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;This abomination of the natural order must be dispelled!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Capped Volcano is an exterior view single map of a volcano that has been capped by a magical seal or futuristic shield that prevents the volcano from erupting. The heat or steam of the volcano could be used to heat or power the village below. The Capped Volcano includes a 360-degree panoramic view of the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Capped Volcano is intended for use in fantasy games. The magical seal could also be a futuristic shield in a science fiction game as well. The Capped Volcano could also be used as a supervillain&amp;rsquo;s master plan in a superhero or modern game, attempting to control volcanoes in the name of world domination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Capped Volcano makes an excellent product for use with Skull Cove since it can be used as an alternative top for the volcanic summit on the island for that product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hooks for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Seal: The magical seal at the top of the mountain keeps a fire elemental within the seal and prevents the volcano from eruption. The fire elemental has been trying to escape for the longest time but has yet to find a way around the magical seal. An enraged druid has ascended to the top of the volcano and is attempting to destroy the seal to bring back the balance of nature and make the volcano active again. But if this happens, the village below will be destroyed. It is up to the group to climb the volcano and defeat the druid and keep the seal intact or join the druid against the villagers trying to stop his ritual and unleash the fire elemental to restore the natural order. The outer barrier can be the seal on the volcano and the inner barrier can be the seal on the fire elemental.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twist: The village below is in an icy terrain. The villagers use the fire seal to draw heat from the volcano that they use to warm their homes. An enormous pipe system comes from a cave far beneath the volcano and pumps steam into their homes for heat. If the fire seal and the village is destroyed, the villagers may freeze to death in the cold temperatures&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
