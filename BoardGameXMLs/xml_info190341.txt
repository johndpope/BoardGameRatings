							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tower of Horace Sharpcheeks</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was a time when the wizard Horace Sharpcheeks overlooked the village of Cresthaven from atop his tower. That was until his tower exploded in a giant green fireball and Horace was never heard from again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The owner of the Crossed Arms inn claims there is an entrance to a mysterious cavern system below the cellar spewing forth all types of monsters onto the once peaceful country side. The village elders also agree that it&amp;rsquo;s worth investigating the rumors and have put out a call to all adventurers to cleanse the site of the wizard&amp;rsquo;s tower and report back their findings. The one thing everyone can agree upon is that goblins have infested the ruins and they must go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
