							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pitfall (ASCII graphics)</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple ASCII graphics game in which the player pilots a spaceship descending into a pit that contains twists and turns which must be avoided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program displays the pit by printing a line of characters at the bottom of the screen which causes the screen to continuously scroll upward. The characters printed on each line portray the varying width of the pit and the locations of objects within the pit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In-Game Instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manuever your ship &amp;yen; with the cursor keys. You can move right, left, up, and down. You get more points for every advance down the pit by manuevering lower down the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are allowed 10 'hits' through walls before your ship blows up. However, after every 3000 points you're given a bonus of 5 'hits' added to your 'hits' total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Running into stars * gives you a bonus 200 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Running into a smiley face â˜º is instant death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
