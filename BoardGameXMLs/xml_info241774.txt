							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sails of Glory Ship Pack: Bonhomme Richard 1779 / Bonhomme Richard</name>
									
			<description>Originally named &amp;ldquo;Duc de Duras&amp;rdquo;, this ship was loaned by the French Crown to the newborn American Continental Navy, to be placed under the command of John Paul Jones; she was renamed &amp;ldquo;Bonhomme Richard&amp;rdquo;, in honor of Benjamin Franklin. During her cruise against the British, in the Battle of Flamborough Head, the Bonhomme Richard met her destiny fighting gloriously against the British Frigate HMS Serapis. Even if his ship was seriously damaged, John Paul Jones won the battle, but in the end lost his ship, which sunk in the aftermath of the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ship pack can also be used to represent another version of the &amp;ldquo;Bonhomme Richard 1779&amp;rdquo; with an alternative, possible armament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ship pack contains a new ship with base, ship card, ship log, and specific deck of maneuver cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
