			<description>Originally these heroes were only available during the B-seiged: Sons of the Abyss Kickstarter campaign. For the 2018 CMON Expo 3 pack sets were given away as promo sets in the swag bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This box numbered BSG-KS03 contains the promo heroes Dahlia, Viggo, and Astrid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BSG-KS03 promo introduces three brand-new Heroes to defend the Citadel of Modhelm: Viggo, the captain; Dahlia, the peasant; Astrid, the princess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Viggo, the Captain is a powerhouse! With his Base Strength 2, he has enough damage to kill Elite Krohns, Elite Gargohs, and Orcs right from the beginning. But more importantly, his starting Special Ability Legendary Vigor allows him to ignore up to 2 hits per round, in true tank format! It makes Viggo ideal to soak up damage where it's needed the most: be it while protecting a vital building or battling Assault Units in a side of the wall that's swarmed with enemies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Growing up in a farm gave Dahlia, the Peasant not only a deal of hardships to overcome, but also a solid dedication to work and a strong will. 'Stoicism', her starting Special Ability, represents Dahlia's natural skill to overcome troubles and frees her up from the requirement of gathering food by the end of each season. That means that her actions can be better spent in other areas of the Citadel and it makes it easier for her to get new Special Abilities. Lastly, she also has a Blue Permanent Card slot, which allows her to use one piece of Weapon or Armor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Astrid, the Princess is unique in the fact that she doesn't have a starting special ability. Instead, Astrid's Special Ability slots have lower Food requirements, enabling her to acquire new Special Abilities quickly and easily. Due to her military knowledge, Astrid has 2 Permanent Card slots, meaning she can don combinations of Weapons and Armor that will give her an edge in combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
