			<description>Luck O' The Dice is a game that consists of dice, cards, and coins.  Each player has 6 dice and starts with 5 cards in their hand.  There are two types cards, dice cards and leprechaun cards.  The dice cards have combinations that each player must roll in order to obtain coins, such as 2 pair of a run of 4.  More coins are received if the player rolls dice combinations in one roll instead of having to roll additional times in order to obtain the desired combination.  Upon completing a dice card the player will place this card face up in front of them.  The game ends when any player completes 5 dice cards.  The first player to complete 5 dice cards also gets a bonus which makes it advantageous to complete dice cards the quickest.  The winner of the game is the person with the most coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leprechaun cards allow players to inhibit their opponent's play or to advance their own.  These cards are played at the beginning of a player's turn.  An example is the Slicer card which allows a player to reduce the number of dice a selected opponent can roll on their next turn.  Every leprechaun card relies on the dice, so player's are never assured of their effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game truly revolves around the use of dice and a player's luck can change with just one roll!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
