			<description>Activity 25th anniversary edition is special edition to the 25th anniversary of the hit among the party-games. As before, three difficulty levels and three ways of the explanation, but there are new words. The new design will make the game even more active!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a party game from Piatnik played in 2-4 teams with at least 2 players each. The teams' meeples move over the board, the goal is to reach the finish. Depending on the sort of field they are currently standing at, one player has to act (pantomime) or to describe or to paint a phrase given on a card and the other members of his team have to find out what that should be. If they manage to do so, their meeple moves forward.&lt;br/&gt;There are several editions and expansions for this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
