							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yeomen: The 9 Card Agincourt Game</name>
									
			<description>Yeomen: The 9 Card Agincourt Game is a solitaire micro card driven game. In the game, you control the French forces and must try to defeat the invading English forces in the Battle of Agincourt, which was fought on October 25, 1415. Your forces are represented by cubes and strength dice. You must move your cubes along a simple point-to-point map, but your movement will be hindered ever step of the way by English arrow fire. Your goal is to move two of your cubes into the English line, which will disrupt it and allow you to capture Henry V.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a CDG system similar to games like We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage (albeit on a much smaller scale). Each turn you will play a card from your hand using it either for its action points or as an event which can aid your play. As you perform actions, such as movement and combat, you will draw special event cards that present new challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played using a total of 9 cards and a handful of cubes and dice. One card contains the map for the game and the other eight cards contain the game's events. Each event card has three separate events on it 1.) Player Event 2.) Movement Event and 3.) Combat Event. You will only need to look at the relevant event for the current phase of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn is played out in a series of phases.&lt;br/&gt;1. Card Play Phase&lt;br/&gt;2. English Archer Phase&lt;br/&gt;3. Combat Phase&lt;br/&gt;4. Victory or Loss Check Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the small number of components and short playing time, the game presents a challenging experience and interesting historical narrative for this famous battle. Can you beat the historical result and lead your French soldiers to victory over the usurpers? Or will you suffer their same fate?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
