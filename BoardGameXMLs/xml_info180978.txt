			<description>SkyLords is a game of mid-air jousting where warriors leap from towers and clash in flight. The combat tests skills of both agility and brute strength. A powerful, heavy fighter may offer up a formidable defense, but a lighter opponent can attack from above. It is crucial to find a balance between power and weight that will beat the strategy of your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games of SkyLords are for 2 players, ages 12 and over. Players draw from the same deck, which must contain at least 26 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before beginning, players set the number of starting Game Points, which corresponds to the amount of Life each player starts with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each turn, players deduct Game Points corresponding to the amount of damage received. The first player to reach zero loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
