			<description>The first player to complete 5 laps around the track wins.  Collect as many of the virtue cards as you can in order to successfully pass Challenge spaces around the track.  Collect equipment cards to avoid track hazards that would send you back to the pit stop.  The gold faith cards are wild cards and may be used in place of equipment or virtue cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
