			<description>The second title, Star Saga: Two - The Clathran Menace was the sequel, released in 1989. In this title, a gigantic armada of alien ships scours the galaxy, seeking to eliminate any and all sentient life. Players must quickly explore the accessible reaches of space, hoping to uncover technology with which to oppose this threat. The game background text describes this as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ominous approach of the survey line of Clathran battle and colony ships was sweeping through the galaxy, identifying, classifying, and exterminating all in its path. Known collectively as the &amp;quot;Clathran Menace&amp;quot;, it meant many things to many people. To most of the human race, it meant nothing, as they were being purposely kept in the dark by their &amp;quot;superiors&amp;quot;, so as not to cause any undue panic. What good was it to evacuate a city in the face of impending disaster if the only road out of town wasn't finished?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Professor Lee Dambroke, Dean of the Department of Xenobiology on the university world of Harvard, the &amp;quot;Clathran Menace&amp;quot; was a matter of science and knowledge; the line must be breached and stopped, or the darkness of ignorance and stagnation would fall over the galaxy for all eternity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Laran Darkwatch, mystic Disciple of the Final Church of Man, it was a question of faith; faith in the ultimate triumph of good over evil, faith in the Founders of the Final Church, and faith in their vision of mankind's place in the Cosmos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To M.J. Turner, the top pilot in the Space Patrol, or the whole galaxy for that matter, it was a question of pride; pride in the abilities of mankind to overcome all obstacles in pursuit of its ultimate destiny ... to rule the stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All were impressive goals, solid tenets upon which to build a society and a glittering future. Or were they merely brittle conceits, ready to crumble at the first pressure from the &amp;quot;Clathran Menace&amp;quot;?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although Star Saga was to be released as a trilogy, Masterplay went out of business before the third game was released, leaving only Star Saga: One - Beyond the Boundary and Star Saga: Two - The Clathran Menace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is unique in the fact that it is a boardgame in which the computer acts as a moderator and tracks resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Sequel to: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Star Saga: One – Beyond The Boundary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
