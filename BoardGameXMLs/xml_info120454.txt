			<description>Designer Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sticky Shticks is a mini-expansion for the Order of the Stick Adventure Game that centers around a single mechanic: Stuff sticking to you. The set features two shticks for each of the six characters that can be &amp;quot;stuck&amp;quot; to another character under the right circumstances, either giving them a penalty of some sort or allowing you to flip it later to just mess with them. It also includes seven new Monster cards that can get stuck to you if they win, forcing you to drag their lazy asses around the dungeon until you (or one of your allies) can defeat it. A Screw This! card that interacts with any sticky card rounds out the 20-card set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
