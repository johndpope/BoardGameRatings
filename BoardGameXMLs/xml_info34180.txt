			<description>Roll A Word is a small portable word game where seven game dice are set into a square plastic frame that allows them to rotate freely. The frame is rolled between the hands and then set down for play. The center die has a different category on each side, and the six other dice have various letters.  Players race to come up with six words that suit the category starting with each of the six letters and write them on their score sheet. A point is scored for each word that has not been duplicated by another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes two extra category dice for variety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
