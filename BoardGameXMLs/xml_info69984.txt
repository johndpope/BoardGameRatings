							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Charlie Chaplin Card Game</name>
									
			<description>An &amp;quot;educational&amp;quot; card game by Bubbles Inc. Published in 1972. A rummy game featuring Charlie Chaplin imagery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game play is that of a basic rummy game. Seven card hands are dealt, runs of three with matching suit are required by the rules. The winner is the first to finish their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The suits are related to Charlie Chaplin's general image; Canes, Shoes (untied), Neckties, and Hats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is interesting because the card backs are unique to each card. This theoretically enables a player to memorize the deck. Each card is unique because it has a flip book of Charlie Chaplin on the card backs. He is twirling his cane. Each card is numbered on the back so that the flip book movie can be played in order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
