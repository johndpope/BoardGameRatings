			<description>In This amazing game, you will be an explorer trapped in a city of hallucinations, your goal is to get rid of the nightmares that overwhelm you and escape from this place of march.&lt;br/&gt;At each turn, the spears of a dice and the result of the nightmare can return to the pages of the necronomicon, and more if you want to make arrangements of Sanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game allows from 2 to 5 players.&lt;br/&gt;Place the game board in the center of the table (the box).&lt;br/&gt;To start the game distribute the nightmare cards in an equal amount to all the players. Also randomly gives each player 5 cards of sanity. &lt;br/&gt;Do not reveal your nightmare or sanity cards to any other player.&lt;br/&gt;In this game of cards and dice, you are at the mercy of the dice roll, which will tell you your destiny.&lt;br/&gt;The turn consists of throwing the dice, and according to its result from 1 to 6, you must put one of your cards in any of the pages of the game board, if this space is empty, you can put any type of card, but If you are busy, you must put a card of the same type.&lt;br/&gt;If you do not have this card, you have the bad luck to take all the cards of that space.&lt;br/&gt;You can also defend yourself using the cards called sanity, which allow you to attack other players or use them for your own benefit.&lt;br/&gt;To win the game you must get rid of all the cards (nightmares) of your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
