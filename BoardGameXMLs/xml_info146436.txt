			<description>Champions Challenge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRO:&lt;br/&gt;The time has come once again. A chance for the divided clans of Rivaland to prove who is&lt;br/&gt;mightiest. Each clan will send forth their greatest warrior to compete in the Champions Challenge.&lt;br/&gt;The victor will be rewarded greatly as well as claim the title of the mightiest clan throughout&lt;br/&gt;Rivaland. That is of course, if there is a victor at all. Known only to the King and his closest&lt;br/&gt;trustees, the Challenge is actually a real threat against the kingdom. Thus meaning it will place the&lt;br/&gt;Champions in real danger. They must face deadly monsters, tricky traps, and even the threat of&lt;br/&gt;each other. However, they may be forced to work together if they wish to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY:&lt;br/&gt;The game starts by choosing the Challenge. Each challenge is played on a different Location tile&lt;br/&gt;and a deck of cards with unique monsters, traps, events, and Boss Monster. Next the players choose&lt;br/&gt;their Champions. There are four clans to choose from with a male and female version of each.&lt;br/&gt;The Champions have unique attributes which make playing each one a bit different. On a turn,&lt;br/&gt;each player has 3 Action points to spend. Actions include recovering, exploring, attacking,&lt;br/&gt;making skill checks, and commanding a pet! While exploring, they will earn Challenge points for&lt;br/&gt;defeating monsters and escaping traps. Each Challenge has a few events that must occur before the&lt;br/&gt;Boss shows up. This can happen at anytime during the game and players might not always be ready!&lt;br/&gt;Players will find powerful treasures like weapons, shields, and talismans that will make them more&lt;br/&gt;powerful. Collecting as many challenge points as possible before the Challenge is completed is the&lt;br/&gt;primary goal, next to surviving of course!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clans of Rivaland:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slayers&lt;br/&gt;Shaman&lt;br/&gt;Marksman&lt;br/&gt;Machinist&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
