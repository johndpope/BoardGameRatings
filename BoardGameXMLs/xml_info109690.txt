			<description>From Zillions of Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rapid advancements in artillery during the late 19th and early 20th century meant that when Word War I broke out, the nature of war would be changed forever. That war marked a shift from the infantry charge of old to the modern artillery barrage. Pieces ranged from small mortars to powerful Howitzers. The larger, more complex the ordnance the more soldiers it required in the gun crews to properly fire it. These pieces usually shot expoling shells - called 'Whiz-Bangs' by the troops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game recreates the trench warfare of the first World War. The grey field in the middle is 'No Man's Land' - the deadly wasteland that existed between the two sides trenches. The first player to safely get a Soldier across No Man's Land and into enemy territory wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soldiers attack by firing shells. The direction and range is determined by how many Soldiers are working together. Two Soldiers connected in a line can attack up to two spaces away in the direction that their line is aimed at. Three Soldiers in a line can attack up to three spaces away, and so on. A lone Soldier can attack any neighboring space. When an attack is made, none of the attacking Soldiers are moved. The opponent's captured Soldier is removed from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Soldier can move one step in any direction. A line of Soldiers can be shifted one space in the direction of their line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
