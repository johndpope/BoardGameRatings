							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gorram Reavers!</name>
									
			<description>Players are parts of Reaver packs from Joss Whedon's &amp;quot;Firefly&amp;quot; universe. The goal is to raid planets and moons for victims. Winner is the first player to a 1000 body count. The board is a variable lay out of planets and moons with chits on them representing populations to ravage. Players move their ships from location to location and trying to over power what they find. Players use cards to increase their crew &amp;quot;packs&amp;quot; and give them bonuses as well as cards that effect the 'verse and other players. Players can upgrade ships to carry bigger crews.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
