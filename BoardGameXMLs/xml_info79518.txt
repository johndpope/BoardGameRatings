			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A privateer sweeping down to capture and destroy enemy shipping... a corporate raider waging a relentless 'tradewar' against a rival... even a pirate, with a handful of cutthroats to stand against the might of the Imperial Navy... these are the adventures that await inside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, for the first time, detailed rules on how to carry out a career of piracy and interstellar plunder in the universe of TRAVELLER. Assemble and equip a corsair expedition, seek backers or government support for a privateering voyage, and set out into the star lanes in search of a laden merchantmen. Stalk victims through the trackless reaches of a star system dodging patrols and seeking out worthwhile targets. Take home prize ships and captured cargo, sell them, conduct repairs, and set out again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains complete rules on all these aspects of commerce raiding and more. Additional rules cover recruitment, starships used by corsairs and pirates, equipment, and pirate character generation. Deckplans and descriptions of a typical corsair are included as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, this supplement contains a complete campaign, Marque and Reprisal, following a privateering expedition against the powerful Carrillian Assembly in the Reavers' Deep sector. The campaign includes general information plus specific details on encounters with four new starship types, with deckplans, descriptions, High Guard stats, and everything else the players and referee need for a complete commerce raiding campaign!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
