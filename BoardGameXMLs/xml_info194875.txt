							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hitman Holiday: Straw Hat Samurai</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The legends of old spoke of a great samurai who donned no armor. He moved faster than the wind, his sword whistling soundlessly. Because no one knew his ream name, they called him by his most prominent feature - a large straw hat covering his features.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TRAITS: Beauty, Great, Happy, Male&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;POWER: Once per game at the start of his turn, Straw Hat Samurai may immediately move to any location on the game board. If he does this, his turn ends immediately after placing onto the new location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Straw Hat Samurai is a limited edition promotional character who will be printed in VERY limited quantity, and available first to Kickstarter backers as an add-on, after which remaining units (if any) will then be sold at rare conventions worldwide. The add-on bundle comes with his own miniature as well as his set of items to become a playable character in Hitman Holiday.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
