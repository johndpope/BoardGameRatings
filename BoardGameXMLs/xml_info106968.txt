			<description>This is a recreation of a rugby match using strategy, dexterity and a bit of luck. &lt;br/&gt;The game board is made of green felt and represents a rugby field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team is composed of 5 player tokens. &lt;br/&gt;These are flat plastic tokens, circa 5 cm long. Players alternate moving around their tokens by throwing a die and moving them one, two or three lengths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is possible to pass the ball to another token before throwing the die. &lt;br/&gt;A defending token can tackle an attacking token or even steal the ball by touching it or passing through it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player wishes to kick the ball, either to gain some ground or to send the ball between the goal posts, he plays &amp;quot;tiddly-wink&amp;quot; with a small plastic ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game lasts for two 20mn halftimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
