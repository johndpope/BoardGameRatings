							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pinocchio Card Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a trick-taking game for four players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt 11 cards and the last 4 cards are laid in the center of the table.  The player to the left of the dealer estimates how many tricks he thinks he can take, and the highest bidder may substitute any or all of the 4 cards in the center for his 4 lowest cards.  Taking the four lowest cards from his hand he lays them down in front of him as one trick and then leads a card.  Each of the other players in turn plays a higher card if possible and the one who plays the card with the highest number takes the trick. The winner then leads a card from his hand.  If the highest bidder doesn't get the number of tricks he bid, he will have that amount deducted from his score.  All other players get one point for each trick they take.  The first player to get 50 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The miniature cards have illustrations on them from Pinocchio.  The instructions are written on the back of the box.  The cards range in number from 1 to 11 with fewer cards for each number as the number increases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7 copies of #1 featuring Monstro&lt;br/&gt;6 copies of #2 featuring Lampwick&lt;br/&gt;6 copies of #3 featuring The Coachman&lt;br/&gt;5 copies of #4 featuring Stromboli&lt;br/&gt;5 copies of #5 featuring Fox and Cat&lt;br/&gt;4 copies of #6 featuring Figaro&lt;br/&gt;4 copies of #7 featuring Cleo&lt;br/&gt;4 copies of #8 featuring Jiminy Cricket&lt;br/&gt;4 copies of #9 featuring Geppetto&lt;br/&gt;2 copies of #10 featuring The Blue Fairy&lt;br/&gt;1 copy of #11 featuring Pinocchio&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The illustrations are copyright W.D.P.
