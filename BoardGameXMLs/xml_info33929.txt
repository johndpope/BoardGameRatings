							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frog Pond: Lily Pads of Doom</name>
									
			<description>Frog Pond is an abstract, 2-player game with the theme of frogs on lily pads.  The lily pad tiles are arranged in a grid, and each player has a frog token.  On your turn, you may move your frog on space orthogonally, and you must slide one row or column of lily pads one space.  (You may perform these actions in either order.)  When two or more groups of lily pads are formed, such that they are not touching, or only touching by a single corner, the smaller group &amp;quot;sinks&amp;quot; and is removed from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to sink the opposing frog, while keeping yours afloat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was designed by 9-year-old Sean Allen and self-published at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.frog-pond.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.frog-pond.com&lt;/a&gt;.  It was packaged with the expansion: Lily Pads of Doom, in which special powers are printed on the lily pad tiles, which occur when the pad is sunk. (With one exception: the Tar Pit, which takes effect when landed on.)  To play without the expansion, you simply ignore the text on the tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
