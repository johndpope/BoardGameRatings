			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highway to Hell is an introductory adventure for the Contagion Revised Edition. The world of Contagion is a dark and terrifying place. On the surface it is no different than the world you and I live in. Most people go on about their lives never realizing the terrors that walk among them. Despite humanity's vast ignorance, the horrors are there. Monsters walk the night. Some of them are human: psychopaths and twisted, evil people much like those in the real world. Some of them are Hellspawn, monsters in service to demons. But even the Hellspawn have their servants?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highway to Hell is an excellent introduction to the Contagion setting. In this adventure, normal people on a normal bus excursion are forced to contend with monsters of human and inhuman nature. An unforeseen accident strands the player characters in rural Illinois. Their only chance of getting help is in the isolated farm community of Flora. Unfortunately for the characters, this town hides a terrible secret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highway to Hell is designed for 4-6 players of 1st or 2nd level. People familiar with other role playing games will find something unusual in the design concept of Highway to Hell. Rather than being a linear module with events that go from point A to point B, this adventure offers a story seed. Basic events are illustrated, along with character snapshots. The ending is left open and ambiguous, for the Gamemaster to decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
