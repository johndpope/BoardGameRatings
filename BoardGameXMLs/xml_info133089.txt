							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">6 Nonmagic Special Qualities for Weapons</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes rules supplements read like the world-setting bible of frustrated novelists. While solid world- building is a useful skill, you don&amp;rsquo;t always need four paragraphs of flavor text to tell you swords are cool, magic is power, shadows are scary, and orcs are savage. Sometimes a GM doesn&amp;rsquo;t have time to slog through a page of history for every magic weapon. Sometimes all that&amp;rsquo;s needed are a few cool ideas, with just enough information to use them in a game. Sometimes, all you need are bullet points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    1 With A Bullet Point is a line of very short, cheap PDFs each of which gives the bare bones of a set of related options. It may be five spells, six feats, eight magic weapon special abilities, or any other short set of related rules we can cram into about a page. Short and simple, these PDFs are for GMs and players who know how to integrate new ideas into their campaigns without any hand-holding, and just need fresh ideas and the rules to support them. No in-character fiction setting the game world. No charts and tables. No sidebars of explanations and optional rules. Just one sentence of explanation for the High Concept of the PDF, then bullet points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The High Concept: Six new nonmagic weapon special qualities (similar to brace, reach, and trip) to vastly expand the options a campaign has for unusual or bizarre tools for killing things. This is the latest in a series of products to celebrate the &amp;quot;Summer of Bullets&amp;quot; event!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The qualities included are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Back Spike: A back spike weapon is a weapon that has a pick-like spike as a counterweight, allowing you to do their normal damage type or piercing damage.&lt;br/&gt;    Basket Hilt: A basket hilt weapon increases your CMD against disarm and sunder maneuvers made against the weapon, and gives you a shield bonus to AC when taking the full defense action.&lt;br/&gt;    Flamberge: A flamberge weapon has an undulating, wavy pattern along its length, allowing you to attack your foes when using the parry class feature.&lt;br/&gt;    Parry Hooks: Parry hooks (also called parierhaken) are forward-curing spikes or flukes mounted just in front of the ricasso (unsharpened section of a blade) of a twohanded sword or bastard sword, or partway along a 2-handed hafted weapon (such as a longspear).They function exactly the same way as the flamberge feature.&lt;br/&gt;    Ringed: A ringed weapon has a number of metal rings added along its length, giving it additional heft and momentum when swung. Increasing damage dealt at the expense of accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;    Springy: A springy weapon is more flexible than normal, able to bend by a considerable angle and still spring back to its original shape. A springy weapon is harder to pin down with combat maneuvers, and the wielder gains a +2 bonus to his CMD against disarm and sunder maneuvers made against it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
