			<description>This is an educational card game that teaches alphabetization.  Each card has a single letter on it.   Players attempt to lay down all of their cards before a sand-timer runs out (and before any other player lays down all their cards) in order to win.  Players lay down cards that are alphabetically one rank above or below the letter on the card shown on the top of the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
