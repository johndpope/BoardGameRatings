			<description>Gaelic Games: Football 2, as with its predecessor, has been officially endorsed by the GAA but not by the GPA meaning the jerseys and stadia will be photo realistic but that the player's name and faces will not be correct. However, the names and appearances of the players can be changed in edit mode. M&amp;iacute;che&amp;aacute;l &amp;Oacute; Muircheartaigh once again provides commentary during the game. Overall, the game is a significant improvement on its predecessor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Features--&lt;br/&gt;    Career Mode: You can take control of your county and follow a full Gaelic Athletic Association season, including the National Football League, Provincial and All-Ireland Football Championships.
