			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xavier the Dark Hunter, also know as the Shadow Inquisitor, is an enigmatic man enlisted to protect High Saint Elienai from harm. His power allows him to exchange his own blood for raw dark energies he may use to destroy even the smallest form of light in any being, consuming their souls in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warrior - Dark Church - Level 50&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Exaltation: If Xavier destroys an enemy Light unit, he recovers all his Action Points and may make a movement even if he has already moved this Turn. This ability is limited to once per Turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Hunter: All of Xavier's attacks against Light units use his secondary Damage attribute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fallen from Grace (Ki, Attack) - +2 Attack / +2 Damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Primordial Sin (Ki, Charge) - Xavier gains a bonus to Damage equal to the LP he sacrifices (maximum 5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soul Steal (Ki, Attack) - Xavier recovers LP equal to the damage this attack inflicts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pewter figure is unpainted and unassembled. Requires additional Anima Tactics figures to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
