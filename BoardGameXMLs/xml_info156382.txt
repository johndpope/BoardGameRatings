							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Coastal Fort</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fort is not terribly large but it controls access to the harbor quite well anyway. Situated in a location that gets flooded by the tides regularly and surrounded by dangerously sharp rock needles the guns behind the fort's battlements are only the final determent to any would be attacker. While the regular flooding protects the fort from siege by land and the dangerous rock needles protect it from most attacks from the seaside this makes the fort hard to supply as well. While the guns are formidable their number and especially the amount of ammunition available for them is quite limited. Still, so far no attacker has been determined enough to try and outlastthe garrison and their guns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
