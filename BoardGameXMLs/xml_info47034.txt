			<description>Before you can stop the end, you must remember who you were in the beginning . . . and you can only do that by discovering The Fire Within!&lt;br/&gt;The Fire Within is the official introductory adventure for the Fireborn roleplaying game. This all-new, dynamic roleplaying game system focuses on cinematic action and epic storytelling. Players begin with characters in modern London, a city on the cusp of a new age of magic. They are more than human, however; they have the souls of dragons, reborn in human form. As the campaign progresses, the characters are continually pulled back in time to a mythic age where they, as dragons, reign supreme. Yet they are opposed by fate as dark beings threaten the world in their mad schemes for power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new adventure showcases the best that Fireborn has to offer, helping you start your new campaign off with all the power, mystery, and savagery of an elder dragon. The Fire Within covers the coming together of the brood, introduces them to the intrigue and danger of magic, and takes them into the mythic age with flashbacks of devastating import. Simultaneously, it gives both GMs and players alike a chance to learn the game's dynamic dice system while exploring the many facets of modern London in a world of magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Perfect beginning to any Fireborn campaign. &lt;br/&gt;     Includes a variety of action and narrative scenes in both the modern and mythic ages. &lt;br/&gt;     Clear guidelines and tips for new GMs combine with several storyline options and plot seeds to create an easy-to-run adventure that can still be tailored to any gaming group's preferred play style. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
