			<description>JYNX is a Contract Rummy-type card game that compounds hilarious must-perform actions on players&amp;mdash;by players&amp;mdash;to prevent them from winning. Because of its unique interactivity, JYNX can be played with a family-friendly G-Rating or NSFW R-Rating depending on players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;JYNX naturally invokes the two things I love about card games: Everyone laughing and everyone trash-talking as the game gets closer to finding a winner. JYNX can go in any direction the players choose, and that asks for fun memories and great game nights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
