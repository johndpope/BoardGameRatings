			<description>It's a beautiful day at the beach and the lifegaurds just announced a Sandcastle Building Contest. This isn't your typical &amp;quot;who can build the greatest sandcastle&amp;quot;, this is a race to see who can build their castle the fastest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sandcastles is played with 6 special beach dice.  During a players turn they roll their die a total of 3 times to try an get various combinations. Different combinations lets the player build sections of their sandcastles by placing cardboard tiles.  But watch out for rogue waves and your opponents &amp;quot;accidently&amp;quot; stepping on you castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple game of lucky with a touch of strategy built in. For ages 6 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sandcastles was designed for 2 players, but does include rules for 3 and 4 players, and two different solo games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
