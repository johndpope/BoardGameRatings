			<description>High in the Mountains of Daggerstone, There once existed the most amazing city. A great and wealthy city, Lost. Swallowed up by the very mountains that acted as its strongest defense from invasion. Though its name has been lost to the ages, its legend lives on. Some say, deep within the mountain&amp;rsquo;s caverns, deep within The City&amp;rsquo;s ruins, The City&amp;rsquo;s greatest treasure remains. The Allstone. A gemstone so saturated with magical energy, that whomever possesses it can do the impossible. It&amp;rsquo;s also REALLY shiny.&lt;br/&gt;Now, The best Petramancers in all the land race to find The City and lay claim to The Allstone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw Ore Cards in order to claim Tool Cards with matching ore types. Claiming Tool Cards earn you Depth Points. First Player to 10 Depth is the winner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
