							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cohort Motivations</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cohort is a round, full non-player character, with motivation and personality, but unlike most other NPCs, he remains with the party all the time. The cohort is under the control of a specific player, and in terms of the rules, he is an extension of that player&amp;rsquo;s character &amp;ndash; he only exists because the character has an ability that says so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why would a person with their own personality be, on the one hand, part of the group, and on the other hand, under the authority of a specific player character? It&amp;rsquo;s a strange position to be in, and maybe that&amp;rsquo;s one of the reasons cohorts are somewhat rare in roleplaying games. Here are a few ideas you can try.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
