			<description>WORLD WAR I&lt;br/&gt;ww.educationalcards.net&lt;br/&gt;ULES (for 3 or 4 players)&lt;br/&gt;AIM: To collect and arrange six Nation-related card events in chronological order.&lt;br/&gt;Each player represents a Nation and must collect cards whose events are relevant&lt;br/&gt;to their Nation. The timeline must contain the following suits:&lt;br/&gt;One &amp;quot;Pre-War Event&amp;quot; card (Purple cards) - Four &amp;quot;War Event&amp;quot; cards (Orange cards) -&lt;br/&gt;One &amp;quot;Post-War Event&amp;quot; card (Green cards).&lt;br/&gt;Each single card displays the points per Nation. These can be zero to three, where&lt;br/&gt;zero indicates that the event is not very relevant to that Nation and three indicates&lt;br/&gt;that the event is very relevant or decisive. Points are found below the original flags.&lt;br/&gt;Dates are found below the card title. These are usually &amp;quot;month-year&amp;quot; (e.g. March 1915)&lt;br/&gt;but some dates are more 'flexible' and embrace a larger period of time (e.g. April-May 1915,&lt;br/&gt;1915-1917, etc.). All cards contain a &amp;quot;Fact&amp;quot; information.&lt;br/&gt;These rules refer to a full round (game). If time allows, more rounds can be played&lt;br/&gt;and a tournament could be set up. Points are collected at the end of each round&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
