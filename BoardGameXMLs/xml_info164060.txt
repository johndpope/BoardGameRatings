							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tales from Dead Men</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF: &lt;br/&gt;The Island of Castonegro is part of a chain of uncharted islands called the Devil&amp;rsquo;s Hammer. Many pirates escape to this island when evading the Spanish fleet because it has a hidden cove, called the Bed of the Black Cat. This is where pirates can rest and resupply their ships for future conquests. A pirate&amp;rsquo;s haven of sorts, but it comes with a price. Every now and then there are tales of ships that stray from the normal safe sea lanes within the island chain and encounter things worse than the Spanish fleet. Those ships are never seen again. But then how can those tales be true if there are never any survivors and, as we know, dead men tell no tales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tales From Dead Men is for beginners. The scenario provides pre-generated characters at the back for ease of play, though the players may wish to create their own characters and ship, especially if they have a copy of Blood Tide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
