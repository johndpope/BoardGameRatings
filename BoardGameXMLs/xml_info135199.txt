			<description>From Published Sources&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Supplement 6: Guns, Gadgets and Gear is the ultimate shopping list for Traveller characters. From axes to vacc suits, this supplement contains a vast range of weaponry, personal armor and equipment spanning all tech levels from stone age to advanced interstellar. Many of the items included are new to Traveller, such as flame rifles, HEAP guns and hypervelocity cannon. Others are compiled from all versions of the rules. Also included are rules for artillery combat in Traveller, for those occasions when a gauss rifle simply won&amp;rsquo;t cut it. Conduct direct and indirect fire with weapons ranging from 20mm autocannon through 800mm superheavy siege guns to battlefield meson accelerators. For those on the receiving end, this supplement also includes rules for surviving suppressive fire and shell bursts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avenger Quote: &amp;ldquo;A book full of sharp and blunt instruments, guns and artillery weapons&amp;hellip; plus a whole lot of useful gear to boot. What&amp;rsquo;s not to like?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
