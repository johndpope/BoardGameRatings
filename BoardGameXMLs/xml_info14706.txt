			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players race to collect the most letter cards by correctly identifying hidden objects that begin with a specific letter. To begin, one player draws a card from the pile, which identifies a letter by both upper and lower case. Another player will open the window that begins with the same letter to reveal the hidden object that they must find. Now the race is on! All players will search through a colorful scene to find the secret object, and the first to spot it will win the letter card. When all the cards in the alphabet deck have been played, the player who earned the most cards wins the game. Children will have fun as they build early reading and vocabulary skills, and develop visual discrimination and matching skills. There are 8 colorful pictures printed on four 10&amp;rdquo; x 10&amp;rdquo; glossy cards, depicting scenes from a farm, a jungle, a carnival, a city intersection, a campsite, outer space, around the house, and under the sea. The game includes 1 alphabet card deck, 1 letter revealer, 8 hidden image clues on 4 glossy cards, 8 colorful scenes on 4 glossy cards, and game instructions. For 2 &amp;ndash; 4 players, Grades K &amp;ndash; 4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
