							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Into the Thieves&#039; Guild (5e)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The powerful thieves&amp;rsquo; guild in Dragonspur City, the capital of Kelerak, is in the midst of a coup. Corfin Ack-Sembar has been the lieutenant of the Thieves&amp;rsquo; Guild for nearly 15 years and he is sick of it. He wishes to be the head of the guild. But for some reason, all of his men are deathly afraid of the current head, one Lalsthor Longcloak. He has had no success paying anyone to assassinate Longcloak; indeed Corfin himself feels an irrational fear when he is in the mysterious presence of his leader. Therefore he has had to suffer as second in command. But recently he has hatched a scheme to depose Longcloak&amp;mdash;word of powerful adventurers has reached him, and he believes he can manipulate these personages into doing his dirty work and slaying Longcloak. However, Longcloak is aware of Corfin&amp;rsquo;s plans, and he doesn&amp;rsquo;t aim to take them lying down. He has decided to try to trick the PCs into killing his rival so that he can remain in power. Both of the powerful guild leaders have allies in the town who will report on the doings of the PCs, giving the crooked leaders opportunity to manipulate them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for four or five 8th - 9th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
