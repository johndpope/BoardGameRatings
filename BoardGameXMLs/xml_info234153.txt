			<description>Contained in Brettspiel Adventskalender 2017 for day 10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONTENTS: 9 bonus tiles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PREPARATION:&lt;br/&gt;Before the game take 9 bonus tiles with a light back out, replace them with the 9 new bonus tiles and shuffle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY:&lt;br/&gt;The new bonus tiles are distributed in the interim scoring along with the other bonus tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can use the new bonus tiles when it is your turn:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the bonus tile with a gem and an arrow: If you use one of the4se bonus tiles then you may move on of your gemstones (you have already placed) to the right or left by one column.  The gemstone must be moved within the same row.  You may only move the gemstone if there is an empty space in the rock there (in the neighboring space of the same row). If there are multiple empty spaces in the rock on this space then you may select one of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the bonus tile with the water drop and an X: If you use this bonus tile you may take one water drop off the game board and place it back in the water box.  It doesn't matter whether the water box is currently in front of you or one of the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to production reasons, the bonus tiles in the Advent Calendar are slightly thinner than the bonus tiles in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
