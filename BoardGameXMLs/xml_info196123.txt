							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fayre of the Forgotten</name>
									
			<description>Fayre of the Forgotten plays on an abandoned funfair around 1900.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tragedy began when a new mirror arrived for the main attraction of the fayre - the Hall of Mirrors. The mirror was rumored to be a powerful magical artifact. But instead of granting wishes and riches, it shattered souls the instant someone glimpsed his or her reflection in it. No visitors come to the fayre anymore as it is a soulless place - and each of the seven proprietors also wants to leave, but as everyone of them has looked into the mirror, their souls are broken. They need to recover their ...or at least a ... complete soul before they can leave. To collect all 20 soul shards the players visit fayre attractions, play action cards, and take control of the attractions. However, there are more aggressive ways to acquire soul shards, as there are ways to just trade your soul shards with an opponent, whether he likes it or not. But beware: exchanging a soul is likely to drive you insane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fayre is designed for two players, where it has a nice tactical level. But it is also fun for up to 5 players, where gambling and the ability to react to the present situation become more important. A soul exchange at the right moment can win or lose the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nebil Abdulgadir, known from big computer game successes like Crysis as well as for his oil paintings in the art scene, is responsible for the great artwork in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
