			<description>The Hag&amp;rsquo;s Hexes contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Roleplaying tips, combat tactics, and mechanical expansions to help make hags truly fear-inspiring villains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Chapters full of new monsters, new magic items, mechanics and examples of bargains and curses that can be inflicted by hags.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A chapter with over a dozen encounter ideas (including monster lists) and three full-length adventures that can be used as-is or split up into smaller encounters with ease!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hag&amp;rsquo;s Hexes is a 66 page guide designed by Dungeon Masters Guild luminaries like JVC Parry and Janek Sielicki alongside rising stars and old stalwarts like Matt Butler, Matthew Gravelyn, and Tim Bannock. It was created with one thing in mind: to make hags more than the sum of their (often meager) Challenge ratings, giving them the mechanics, roleplay potential, and weird magic that can inspire campaigns, lay low kings and warlords, and potentially ensnare unwary Player Characters into campaign-changing curses or long-term bargains that force them into terrible moral quandaries!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Split into five chapters, the authors have provided everything a DM needs to terrify their players for years to come. The Bestiary features over a dozen monsters; some are new hags, some are their minions or even their mobile lairs, and one of them &amp;mdash; the Shaitan AKA Desert Hag &amp;mdash; was featured in Monsters of the Guild! Bargains &amp;amp; Curses is a chapter filled with ideas that can kick-start campaigns, threaten valued NPCs, or put Player Characters&amp;rsquo; very existence and morality at stake. Chapter 3 includes two dozen items of wonderment, weirdness, and dread, ranging from fairy tale-inspired items of whimsy to terribly cursed items of horror. Chapter 4 is titled &amp;ldquo;Filthy, Vile &amp;amp; Downright Dirty&amp;rdquo; and provides dozens of roleplaying tips to make hags come alive, new mechanics inspired by and expanding on Volo&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Monsters (coven spell lists, aunties, grandmothers, alternative coven members), and ends with useful combat tactics for each of the hags from the Monster Manual and Volo&amp;rsquo;s Guide, as well as tactics for covens. Finally, Chapter 5 presents five encounter groups (with sub-encounters) to give you quick story seeds and monster lists that you can put together in minutes to create a single encounter or to inspire a full campaign, and ends with three full-length adventures &amp;mdash; each with 3-5 encounters &amp;mdash; that showcase many of the new monsters, rules, magic items, and so on that appeared in earlier chapters. Each of these adventures comes with an encounter map meant to act as inspiration for hag lairs, and they include useful mechanical ideas for terrain effects and descriptive keywords listed directly on the map for added inspiration and easy customization!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by Tim Bannock. Written by Matt Butler, JVC Parry, Janek Sielicki, and Tim Bannock. Edited by Matthew Gravelyn and Tim Bannock. Cover Art by Elena Naylor. Cartography by Tim Bannock using Inkwell Ideas&amp;rsquo; Dungeonographer (Dungeonographer is copyright Inkwell Ideas). Layout &amp;amp; Graphic Elements by Elena Naylor with Tim Bannock.

Blackmon, Joyce Maureira, Petr Kratochvil, Jayaraj Paul, Brian Brinlee, and Wizards of the Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
