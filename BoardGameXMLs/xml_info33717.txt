			<description>This game was created in a thread by Legomancer to which he wanted to create a game from an idea he had, but wanted all BGGers to help if they wanted to posting it through a thread on the bgg, ending up here: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/88063&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/88063&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through about a 2 week period, this game came to light, was played, critiqued and  tested; some good some bad, but in the end, it worked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are BGGers getting together for game night. Each has brought a pile of games and is trying to get certain games on the table for playing. Best played with 3+ players due to the bidding mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A board is set out on the table. A 20 point, timer track encircles the entire board. In the center is a board with five tracks on it. The tracks are labeled &amp;quot;Theme&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Weight&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Luck&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Strategy&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Interaction&amp;quot; &lt;br/&gt;Each track is numbered 0, 1-9, with the zones 1-3, 4-6, and 7-9 clearly marked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the course of the game each player will blind bid to move the marker up or down the track of their choice, trying to either keep that track in the same zone as their played game(s) or new game they wish to start. Blind bids are all taken, even if you don't win. The counters used for bidding are divided amongst players who bid zero, keeping a closed economy for &amp;quot;money&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after a set amount of &amp;quot;game-time&amp;quot; has gone by which all players' games add to when they are completed. Add up the total games' times for the winner; highest wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each person who decides to make this game will be able to place the name and categories of their own favorite games as it comes with blank cards to print out. Also, a supply of counters will be needed for the bidding as well as a printing of the gameboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules can be found on the thread: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/88063&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/88063&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
