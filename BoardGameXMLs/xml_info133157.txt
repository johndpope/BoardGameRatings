			<description>General info on the &amp;quot;Krimi Total&amp;quot; series: Murder mystery games in which players act out their role and try to solve the mystery. The game is played in several rounds; there are discussions, allegations, and at the end of the game everybody has to state who they think the culprit is and what happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Info on this particular case: This case is aimed at teenagers, so it is less brutal (no murder).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's one of the biggest days of the school year. The casting of the drama group will take place after lunch break! Who is going to get the leading role? But suddenly an ambulance arrives, taking Marie, one of the top contenders for the leading role, to the hospital. What happened? Was it an accident? Or is somebody else to blame for Marie's sudden illness? And if so, who is it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;Das Gift der Rivalen&amp;quot; there are 9 obligatory roles: (4 male, 5 female) and one optional role that can be either male or female. The roles are mostly 13-to-15-year-old students from the drama group and their friends. There are two adult roles (teachers) and the optional role is also an adult (police inspector).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
