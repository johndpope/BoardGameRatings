			<description>Snake Pit&lt;br/&gt;Can you escape?&lt;br/&gt;Board Game Ages 7 and up&lt;br/&gt;2 - 4 players&lt;br/&gt;Playing board 10&amp;frac12;&amp;quot; x 10&amp;frac12;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game:  Be the first to collect all five weapon tokens (rope, gun, stones, whip, and plank of wood) and escape from the snakepit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game comes in a small box.  The board is 6 pieces that fit together like a jigsaw.  Also included are one die, 12 stands, 12 cardboard figures (4 players and 8 snakes), and a perforated piece of cardboard with 4 each of rope, plank, whip, pistol, and pile of rocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts in the middle of the board with the 8 snakes around the outside at the top of the circular pit.  As a player gains each weapon they get to move up one level until they get to the top and reach their colour-coded exit.  Players have the option of moving themselves AND one of the snakes (split between the die roll).  Opponents hit with a snake are knocked down a level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
