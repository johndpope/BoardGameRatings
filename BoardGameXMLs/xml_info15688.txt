			<description>SGB-8 Normandy Operation Overlord (1985) (JPY 4300)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two identical 11x17&amp;rdquo; maps, two 11x17&amp;rdquo; color PAC (one for each player), one PAC, 504 counters, 24-pg. rulebook. Only the historical scenario is presented. The game takes 32 turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units are divisions with no combat values. Each division has an associated marker for use on the PAC. The player&amp;rsquo;s PACs are tracking intensive, recording supplies, combat efficiency, reinforcement appearance, and much, much more. Many of the rules cover the interaction of the markers on the PACs during combat. I imagine most of the &amp;lsquo;game&amp;rsquo; here is managing your PAC correctly vis-&amp;agrave;-vis the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other counters include DD tanks, commandos, coastal artillery, strong points, naval bombardment and TAC air markers and a whole handful with Japanese text (which is somewhat rare in Japanese games actually).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is way up on my list of games needing translation. It almost looks like one of the old double-blind games (with the two identical maps), except that there are no apparent rules for those procedures. Maybe I received an extra map by mistake? A very interesting-looking game indeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
