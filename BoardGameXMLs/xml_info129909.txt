							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Needs of the Few (Alpha)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You were barely a teenager when they blasted you off into space. The Institution said it was for your enrichment. But now the Captain&amp;rsquo;s dead, and the only things he&amp;rsquo;s left you with are nightmares, a dwindling supply of dehydrated food, and them- your fellow crew. There are times when the ghost of the past just won&amp;rsquo;t leave you be, but it&amp;rsquo;s mostly the daylight phantoms of the present that get on your nerves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The engineer has been hoarding food in between shifts pretending to fix the engine (you&amp;rsquo;re sure he&amp;rsquo;s sabotaging it). The biologist keeps herself locked in her room most of the day doing fuck knows what (she&amp;rsquo;s got to be poisoning the food). The computer-savvy tech keeps the viewscreens lit with porn while he&amp;rsquo;s running diagnostics on the failing mainframe (can he even get it up?). You&amp;rsquo;re the doctor. Which one do you euthanize first?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Needs of the Few is a four-player roleplaying game about people on the brink who have to deal with their haunting pasts and, worst of all, each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Take on one of four roles&amp;ndash;The Captain, The Professional, The Victim, and The Positive One&amp;ndash;each with their own baggage to deal with (or not deal with) in play&lt;br/&gt;     Parlor game-like mechanics challenge players to guess each others Secrets, while preserving their own&lt;br/&gt;     Space maaaaaadnesssss&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
