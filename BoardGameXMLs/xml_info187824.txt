							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The SCORE Core Rules</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SCORE is a generic, universal role-playing framework that is intended to be adaptable to any genre.  The author has used the system to support a science fiction and a fantasy campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the system, characters have Attributes (Strength, Agility, Endurance, Willpower, Perception, Intellect, Intuition, Charisma, Appearance, and Morality) that start with a Rating of 3.  Higher Ratings are purchased form a point pool.  Skills also are purchased from the same pool; Skills have a numeric Level.  Tasks, including combat, are resolved with a modified dice roll (2d10, usually) against a target Difficulty.  Combat has various additional rules, including specific rules for unarmed combat, missile combat, and other special situations.  An optional Degree of Success by Difficulty table can give variable success/failure results.  Characters gain experience points and spend them to increase numeric ratings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
