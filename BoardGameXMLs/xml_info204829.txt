			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the heart of all great stories are strong characters. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether you&amp;rsquo;re reading a short story, writing a novel, or watching a play. The characters found in TV series, comic books, and games are more alike on a creative level than they are different. The symbiotic relationship between character and story is universal across media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this book, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore what goes into crafting memorable and enjoyable characters. While the focus is on tabletop roleplaying games, I&amp;rsquo;ll be using writing terms rather than RPG jargon. It&amp;rsquo;s not going to be about crunching numbers or picking abilities. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about writing your character, rather than just playing them. Because while there are other hats that we wear around the table, including those of performer and tactician, we&amp;rsquo;re all writers. Even if we never put pen to paper or fingers to keyboard, it&amp;rsquo;s the writer&amp;rsquo;s craft that we&amp;rsquo;re dabbling in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
