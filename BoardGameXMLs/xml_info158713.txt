			<description>D&amp;euro;mocracia is a Spanish politics game simulating a corrupt two-party democratic system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players represent political leaders of either party. They must cooperate with their party partner to win the support of the different election districts while rivaling each other to be the most popular and therefore chosen candidate for President. Candidates winning the election become President, who must avoid resignation at all costs during the entire term in order to score a victory point. The game ends after the third election, which awards a victory point to the successful candidate. If tie-breaking is necessary, the player who have secured the most retirement-plan points during the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the number of players is 3, 5 or 6, some players represent smaller parties with a different goal, to become one of the two large parties by being the second most voted party at any election.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In D&amp;euro;mocracia, players have &amp;mdash;and might hire&amp;mdash; agents, including leader, party barons, media and judges to play cards for them. These cards are placed face down, one per agent, and include funding for their political or scheme activities and the activities themselves. Cards may be legal or illegal to play. After every player has placed their cards, they start revealing and getting the effects of the cards played on a turn-by-turn basis. Each judge investigates one agent per turn, placing tokens right before anyone starts revealing cards. If the agent's card is illegal upon revelation, a trial against the agent takes place. All players having judges can influence the trial's outcome, which might involve losing the agent and the card played by them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
