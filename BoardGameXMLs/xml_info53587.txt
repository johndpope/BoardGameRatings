			<description>This game is aimed at recreating the events celebrated in The Quintana, held in Ascoli Piceno in Le Marche, Italy on the first Sunday in August.  This pageant remembers the political in-fighting that raged in the town during the early Renaissance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to 6 factions struggle to provide the best jouster to claim the rights as the top faction for the coming year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a roll and move game where you have to occasionally answer trivia questions about the Quintana.  There isn't much for gamers here but, for those who've seen the Qunitana, it is an evocative rendition of the events in game form with all the components coloured according to the flags of the 6 factions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
