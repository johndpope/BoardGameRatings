			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;    Markets and Mercenaries is a simple and quick board game that combines the interesting features of many more primitive &amp;quot;build a colony&amp;quot; computer and board games (resources, buildings, market economics, special events) while excluding features that tend to slow such a game down (exploration, territorial expansion, conquest). The game uses a Monopoly-like path around the board's outer edge allow random events in a way that carefully prohibits luck from overriding strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use wise resource management and strategic construction of new buildings to expand their colony. Resources are not only traded among players but bought and sold with the Empire in a market with varying (and manipulatable) prices. The colonies also build up military strength to use at the conclusion of the game when the colonies jointly declare independence and the Empire responds with an invading army. &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
