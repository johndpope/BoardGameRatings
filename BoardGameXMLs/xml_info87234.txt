			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 7-page PDF is designed to help GMs world build and bring adventures out of the dungeon by providing five ready-to-use festivals, fairs, and holy days. It's an invaluable tool for building a textured culture, for throwing at PCs to enliven their arrival in a new community, and for weaving a unique tapestry to serve as the backdrop for urban adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learning how people celebrate allows us to better understand their values, their fears, their collective personality. While PCs may quickly forget details about a pig-raising village they passed through, it's unlikely they'd forget the community that hosts the Razorback Festival during which pigs are slaughtered and in butcher-bees and which culminates in the grand spectacle of slaves engaging in gladiatorial combat against a dire boar -- the survivors being granted freedom and existence as were-boars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
