							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Drudge! Core Rule Book</name>
									
			<description>Drudge! Core Rule Book (Version 1.00) includes everything you need to play (except models and terrain).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An easy to learn rule system with fast paced action, for any genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Easy to learn game-system.&lt;br/&gt;     Fast, super-quick action and fight rules.&lt;br/&gt;     Functional for any genre and setting.&lt;br/&gt;     Role playing sessions possible.&lt;br/&gt;     Character development between adventures.&lt;br/&gt;     Generic rules for skills so new skills can easily be added.&lt;br/&gt;     Six-sided dice based, for ease of transport and use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drudge! is different in that way that the genre does not matter. You can use Drudge! in any setting &amp;ndash; and we even encourage you to experiment, and maybe use more than one genre (a sci-fi western, steam-punk horror &amp;ndash; or maybe all of the above?).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drudge! is easy to understand, and easy to build upon. But it is powerful, and it takes some serious developement to get your characters perfect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Drudge! you play with groups of characters &amp;ndash; up to five characters per group. Some are basic gun-fodder (Drudges!), and some are more specialized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is possible to play alone (solo), or with one or more friends. Use a Game Master (GM) if needed &amp;ndash; or run sessions without a GM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Core Rule Book includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Character and Group creation.&lt;br/&gt;     Skills and Abilities rules.&lt;br/&gt;     Points/Rewards system for advancement.&lt;br/&gt;     Combat and Movement Phases explained.&lt;br/&gt;     Roleplaying and Table Top sessions.&lt;br/&gt;     Vehicles, Weapons and Armour in detail.&lt;br/&gt;     Adventure and Campaign creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 40 paged core rule book also include three (3) adventure ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(From the Official Site &amp;amp; Publisher.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
