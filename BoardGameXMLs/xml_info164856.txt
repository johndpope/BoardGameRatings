			<description>Project Football is a game that tries to deliver the full feel of football. The game starts with a draft to fill the 18 man squad with every player having their abilities. The gameplay resolves by playing action cards and taking turns in activating players. The game simulates almost all possible real life situations from fouls, throw ins and corners to penalties, injuries, hand balls ot yellow and red cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attribute test are made in one of three ways (agreed before kick off:&lt;br/&gt;1. By rolling a 20-sided die&lt;br/&gt;2. By rolling a 20-sided die or by playing a &amp;quot;fate&amp;quot; card from Your hand&lt;br/&gt;3. By flipping the top card of Your &amp;quot;fate&amp;quot; deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first thought of this game was in April 2013, but not until February 2014 that I found the mechanics that I want to use to fuel my ideas. After that a working prototype has been made, and during several test the game had gotten a good reception. Now it's in a very advance test shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently a 4th prototype version was printed with minor changes in game mechanics, and with prototype card layouts, and new game board preparing the title for release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
