							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Adventure Shorts, Volume Three</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure shorts volume three is series of five short encounters, written for the fifth edition of the world's most popular roleplaying game. They can be played as stand-alone encounters or dropped into an existing adventure or campaign and are meant to last for about a one-hour gaming session. As in some of our other titles we&amp;rsquo;re providing balanced encounters and treasure for a party of five characters of levels two, four and six.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The encounters include monsters, traps, obstacles, secret codes, and treasure to challenge your fifth edition players. We&amp;rsquo;ve also included printer-friendly maps that can be used to set up your own player grids. The encounter titles are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Arcane Pillar: Reading the magic writing on a strange stone pillar in the woods has some unexpected results.&lt;br/&gt;     Carpath Brothers: The mausoleum of two long-dead evil brothers may still have secrets to yield.&lt;br/&gt;     The Fog: After entering a dense fog, the adventurers discover the temple of a goddess.&lt;br/&gt;     The Scribe: A simple scribe, on his way home for the evening, is attacked as he nears his cottage. He carries a small, interesting key around his neck.&lt;br/&gt;     Young Beggar: The adventurers have a chance help someone in need. But there&amp;rsquo;s more to this young beggar than meets the eye.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
