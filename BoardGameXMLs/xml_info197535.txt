							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Master of Kung Fu</name>
									
			<description>The Master of the Jade Temple School of Kung Fu has called out the students of the Demon Head School of Kung Fu for the lowlife, degenerate thugs that they are.  Enraged, the warriors of the Demon Head School attack the Jade Temple, killing its Master and beating its students mercilessly.  Some of the students, including the players, manage to escape into the Chinese countryside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will need to heal themselves, train both physically and mentally, earn gold to acquire the weapons of Kung Fu, and raise their prestige in order to train with other masters and learn the secrets of Kung Fu styles.  But the warriors of the Demon Head School are trailing the students and will attack from time to time.  After nine years of training, a final showdown will occur.  One student will succumb to his wounds and die after the fight.  Of the survivors, only the student who has gained the most honor will emerge triumphant over the Demon Heads and re-establish the Jade Temple school as its new Master of Kung Fu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with a draft of the supply and style cards.  The main element of the rest of the game is worker placement.  But there's a twist - there's only one &amp;quot;worker&amp;quot;, themselves, to place each round.  And instead of placing workers on action spaces, players place them BETWEEN action spaces to activate adjacent actions.  Plus, the action spaces themselves are modular and change order and frequency each round, creating an ever-changing environment that challenges players to use adaptive strategy to be successful.  Every three rounds, there is a Kingsburg-esque Attack Phase, in which players will use their acquired supplies and learned styles to defeat the enemies of their school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
