			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Save the Rock!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jaxom Star has a reputation as a daredevil.  In a rickety old skiff, he sails the most perilous regions of Wildspace, scavenging for items to sell in his grandfather's junk booth on the Rock of Bral.  Most citizens of that asteroid city consider him a loon.  But Jaxom thinks they at least admire his courage.  If only they would respect him as a person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User notes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although technically marketed as part of the &amp;quot;Wild Space&amp;quot; setting, this deserves to be counted as part of the Spelljammer family. TSR planned to relaunch the Spelljammer setting with a series of &amp;quot;Wild Space&amp;quot; products, including boxed sets with interactive video cassettes (similar to the Dragon Strike line). However, the Wild Space line was canceled at the last moment, leaving this title in the Endless Quest series as the only published item to bear the &amp;quot;Wild Space&amp;quot; logo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
