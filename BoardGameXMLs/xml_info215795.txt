							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Unkindness of Ravens</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Out of curiosity... Amelio Gonzolez... stuck a flaming candle... in the protruding ear of... Maria Sanchez... and smiled wickedly.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uncover an act most cruel by revealing six story elements that together describe the treachery and spell the word UNKIND.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Careful though, your opponents are equally devilish, so you'll need to use your letters, corvid tokens, and perhaps summon a black raven to stop them. 2 to 5 players and plays in about 20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Corvid Tokens can also be used to expand your options and deepen your strategy in Murder of Crows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE:&lt;br/&gt;Be the first player to spell the word UNKIND in front of you and then read the Act Most Cruel along the bottom of the cards aloud to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAY:&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you draw 1 card and play 1 card in front of you in order to spell the word UNKIND.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When played, a card's ability is activated:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Undo: Pick a player, they must return the last card they played into their Unkind to their hand.&lt;br/&gt;     Need: Draw 1 card and 1 corvid.&lt;br/&gt;     Kill: Remove one letter from an opponent&amp;rsquo;s UNKIND&lt;br/&gt;     Investigate: Draw 2 corvid Tokens, then look at a player's hand.&lt;br/&gt;     Drag: Collect 1 corvid Token from another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alternatively, a player can acquire a Corvid Token: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     When casting a spell, a player may instead draw a corvid token. Spell does not occur.&lt;br/&gt;     When drawing a card, a player may instead draw a corvid token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Countering Card Abilities:&lt;br/&gt;When a card is played, another player may prevent its effect from affecting them (alone) by discarding a card from their hand. The discarded card must have the same number of Crows in the top left corner as the card played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using Corvid Tokens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     When playing a letter card, a player may spend corvid token(s), to increase the crow value of the card by 1 crow per token.&lt;br/&gt;     When countering a spell, a player may spend corvid token(s), to increase or decrease the crow value of the card by 1 crow per token.&lt;br/&gt;     Before ending their turn, a player may place corvid token(s) on any empty letter spot(s) in another player&amp;rsquo;s UNKIND. Players may add to spots with corvid token(s), but no letter spot may every contain more than 5 corvid token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corvid Tokens in your Murder&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     When there is one or more corvid tokens in your murder, you may only play a letter card into that spot if you over come the total number of Birds in the spot. The player can do this with just a letter card, or it may require additional crows added to the card (An empty spot with 5 corvid tokens, could be removed with a 3 Crow Letter card and 3 corvid tokens). Once overcome, all the corvid tokens are removed.&lt;br/&gt;     A Wild Crow/Raven card may be placed in a empty spot regardless of corvid tokens. The corvid tokens are all removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wild Ravens Cards&lt;br/&gt;In Unkindness of Ravens, each Raven card has a unique ability written on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
