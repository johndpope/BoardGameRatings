			<description>There are now different ways to play each turn! The person asking the question selects which 'mode' they want before pulling a card:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Strategic mode (also known as classic) - the person asking the question gets a point if they vote the same as society&lt;br/&gt;    Honesty mode - the person asking the question gets a point if they vote the same as society and each member of society that voted the same as the person asking the question gets a point&lt;br/&gt;    Majority mode - every person in the majority gets one point, regardless of who is asking the question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
