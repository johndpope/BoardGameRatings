							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Auf Schleichpfaden mit Karl May</name>
									
			<description>Objective: being Karl May - reach (=escape) with one of your 4 trappers one corner; being an Indian tribe - catch the very last trapper and escape successfully with one of your Indians (reaching the centre or one corner) OR catch the last of the Indian tribe who caught the last trapper and escape....&lt;br/&gt; - moving by turns -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Determine who becomes the trapper (highest number).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trappers start in the centre, each Indian tribe in a different corner (depending on no. of participants). Moving by die, a '6' let you move again. All Indians try to catch trappers; trappers try to escape, but may catch Indians, too. An enemy is caught if your pawn's move ends exactly on opponent's position. After all trappers are caught Indians will fight for the loot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note:&lt;br/&gt;Wooden pawns - as if they were manufactured in the Erz mountains&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
