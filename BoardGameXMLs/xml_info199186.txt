			<description>The players have to move two cars from their garage at the corners of the game board around the track and back to their garage. Movement is determined by a die. Two traffic lights are operated by the roll of a 3 or a 5. Two event spaces (breakdown and restaurant/stadion) hinder the movement of the cars. The first player to return his two cars to his garage wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
