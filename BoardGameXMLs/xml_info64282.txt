			<description>Players will learn strategies for taking back their communities from gang domination. Through the discussion of the game choices made and interaction between players, learners will build ties with other concerned community members and increasing the likelihood their interventions will be successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The learners are parents, teachers, church members, students, and other community members who wish to learn strategies for winning back control of their neighborhoods from street gangs. These people live in the areas where gangs have made life violent and unsafe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed to be played at a church, recreation center, police storefront, or other community centers. A complete game is about 1-2 hours in duration, depending on the number of players and discussion time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to cover all of the squares in the team's territory with the team's markers. The territory is one quadrant of the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      Game board&lt;br/&gt;     4 playing tokens, each a different color&lt;br/&gt;     1 stack of Chance Cards&lt;br/&gt;     1 stack of Choice cards&lt;br/&gt;     4 sets of 61 markers (Each set corresponds to a color of marker)&lt;br/&gt;     2 die &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
