			<description>Magic Rainbow is a game designed to help children learn colors and read color words.  Players move along the magic rainbow track by drawing a card with either a color or the name of a color printed on it.  They then move to the next space of that color on the track (similar to Candyland).  First player to reach the top of the rainbow wins.  There are also obstacles (such as black clouds with rainbow slides) that can set players back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has an interesting game board.  It is large (20&amp;quot;x26&amp;quot;) and comes as four giant puzzle pieces to be assembled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
