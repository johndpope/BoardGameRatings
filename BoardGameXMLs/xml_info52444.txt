							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Bushels of Rye</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;100 Bushels of Rye is a H&amp;acirc;rnWorld adventure module. Although originally written for H&amp;acirc;rnMaster, it is sufficiently generic to be adapted to most other rule systems. The adventure is set in Kaldor, a feudal kingdom in eastern H&amp;acirc;rn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a gloomy, overcast, autumn day in Olokand. Sir Maldan Harabor, Sheriff of Meselynshire, has been informed by the local chapter of the Miners' Guild that the Amba Mine in the west of his shire has been closed due to a mysterious outbreak of violence. Several murders have occurred, and to make matters worse, unconfirmed rumors indicate the crimes have spread to the nearby village of Loban itself. A written request for information from Sir Kathel Dezaller, lord of Loban manor, has been ignored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sir Maldan is anxious to see that the mine is re-opened before his own lord, the King of Kaldor, starts asking some embarrassing questions. He is also worried that Loban's annual feudal obligation, namely 100 bushels of rye, has not yet been received. Harvest time has passed, and this debt has always been delivered by this time in past years. He would be a lot more worried if he knew the truth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players must investigate the violence at Loban manor and Amba mine, and then if possible solve the mystery. The village of Loban has been mapped and described in some detail. The module will give your players a better understanding of rural life on H&amp;acirc;rn, in addition to a scare or two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
