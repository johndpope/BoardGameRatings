			<description>As in the original Monopoly game, players start with cash in hand, roll dice, and move a token around the game board while hoping to purchase properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each property is represented by one or more billboards, with the more valuable properties having larger billboards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you purchase a property, you place a billboard into your personal plastic tower; when you pass &amp;quot;Go!&amp;quot; on the game board, you earn income based on the height of your tower. &lt;br/&gt;Reach a value of $800 on your tower, and you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you land on an opponent's property, you pay rent to that player based on the height of her tower. &lt;br/&gt;If you don't have enough cash on hand, hand over the top billboard in your tower instead but keep the cash you do have. This mechanism means there is no player elimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While players don't trade properties, you can effectively steal them through the use of cards and the &amp;quot;swap&amp;quot; face on one die, which allows you to swap the top billboards on two towers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player don't have pawns in this game, they move with large plastic cycling riders on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
