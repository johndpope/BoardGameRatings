			<description>title page subtitle&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon-delving, monster-smashing, dice-rolling role-playing game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from Welcome to GENERALA:&lt;br/&gt;This book contains everything you&amp;rsquo;ll need to start running classic dungeon-crawl style adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generala is a rules-light system meant for single-shot adventures rather than on-going campaigns. Focus is on simple, fast game play. Characters are made with a point- based skill system and a single mechanic covers all actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resolutions are handled with a mechanic you probably already know, based on the dice game  Generala, similar to the games Yacht and Poker Dice. Players roll dice and try to make poker hands with the numbers rolled. Higher hands mean success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generala also encourages active play by giving players a risk/chance system by giving them a set number of re-rolls to affect failing roles or try to boost scores even higher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generala is designed to play light and fast while being an easy system to learn. Players throw lots of dice, characters plow through mystical dungeons, monstrous creatures fall by the ton, and heroes are forged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generala is designed to play light and fast while being an easy system to learn. Players throw lots of dice, characters plow through mystical dungeons, monstrous creatures fall by the ton, and heroes are forged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user note:&lt;br/&gt;The printable booklet layout versions are designed to be duplex printed, folded and stapled to create a digest-sized rules booklet.  There are two cover options, printer-friendly and full-color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
