			<description>The game consists of a board with an empty crossword grid with alternating 2 x 2 grids in white, black and red. Each player receives 48 letters and joker tiles, some of which are black, some red and some white. &lt;br/&gt;Each player now draws 7 of his/her letters into the hand. The first player forms a word on the board, then draws new letters. However, placing a red tile on a red square means the player can draw an extra tile; placing a non-black letter on a black field or a black letter on a non-black field means the player has to drop a letter. Other players follow in turn order, adding letters to the first word crossword-style. The first player to get rid of all of his/her tiles is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
