			<description>Echelon is a three-dimensional abstract strategy game in which two players build a structure while attempting to get five cubes of their own color in a row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting with a black &amp;quot;starting cube&amp;quot;, players alternate placing in one of two ways:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Playing three cubes in a row (as viewed from above), with at least one cube on top of a preexisting one, or;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Playing two cubes as above, but also removing an edge-adjacent cube from the structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also includes two &amp;quot;anchor cubes&amp;quot; of each color, which may not be removed from play by either player, as well as one &amp;quot;shift cube&amp;quot; for each, which may only be removed by the owning player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: the front of the package claims the game is suitable for 2-4 players, but the interior of the rulebook reveals that doing so entails purchasing another set of cubes (they were apparently sold in two sets; one with red and blue cubes, and the other with green and purple).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
