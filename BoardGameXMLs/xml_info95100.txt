			<description>An adventure game where players try to find a legendary wine barrel in the ruins of a castle. The game is based on the adventure comic with the same name from Yves Chaland. Each player represents a character from that comic.&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you roll the dice and move that number of spaces. The space you land is either blank (and the next player takes his turn); it on contains an event (like miss one turn, roll the die and move that more spaces, pay a fine, etc.); or it contains a color and a symbol. In the latter case, the player consults his character booklet and looks up the page with the corresponding color and symbol. A short story there is read and and the player has to decide what to do next: the booklet gives two or more choices and each choice corresponds to a numbered paragraph in the rule book, which is looked up and carried out. &lt;br/&gt;These paragraphs are the heart of the game and the key to victory. The rule book also suggests that you read the comic book to understand the game and the story better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
