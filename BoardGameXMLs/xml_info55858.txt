			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game you&amp;rsquo;ve got in your hands was the result of a great drinking night. I think. Well, I don&amp;acute;t remember it well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In first place we have a ridiculous mythology where gods died in battle with demons, and they left the magic to humanity so that they could survive... If this is what you want to believe... After a couple of spells your character will possibly have some discrepancies about the origins of the magic. And he won&amp;rsquo;t be polite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have too the fact that the world is flat. But this time there aren&amp;rsquo;t any elephants, tortoises or kids to hold it. That means the world is falling down through the cosmic infinite. Bloody fast. And the Day of the End of the World... but not... that&amp;acute;s too absurd...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the other hand we have Hell, plenty of demons, which geographically exists. It&amp;acute;s in the map! And once your character dies he will be there (I promise you) good as he may have been. So there are no good boys in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, what have we got in this game...? Well, a couple of beers on the table, some buddies and an afternoon to laugh your head off sending our character to the funniest of ruins...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
