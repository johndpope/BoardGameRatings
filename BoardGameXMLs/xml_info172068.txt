			<description>Demi: Labyrinth of the Gods is a cooperative game where each player takes on the role of a modern day demigod (there are eight to choose from). These 2-4 players must then work together to navigate a labyrinth that shifts and changes as you play, while trying to accomplish the task of finding three ancient artifacts the gods have demanded in order to prove your worth and gain access to the exit - but there's a catch!  This labyrinth is filled with mythic monsters and traps...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a tile-based game.  A grid of thirty face-down tiles represent rooms within the labyrinth.  Players move together as one, flipping over a room to move into it, one room at a time.  To represent the fact that the Labyrinth is always in motion, when the players enter a new room they choose the orientation of that room (provided one entrance/exit points back the way they came).  They then replace the room they came from with a room from the next difficulty tier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within each room they draw from an encounter deck and face off against monsters out of Greek mythology, traps, or if lucky - a pile of resources they can use to upgrade their gear or utilize their special abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the eight demigods has three special abilities:  A Free Ability they can utilize anytime the text applies, a Cost Ability they can pay resources they've gathered to activate, and a Coin-Flip ability they receive later in the game, letting them tempt the fates for a positive or potentially negative outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning means reaching opposite corners three times to gather the three artifacts, then back once more to find the exit - the shifting rooms that are constantly replaced as you progress means player tactics in room orientation to determine the route become a deciding factor in the group's ability to make it out alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
