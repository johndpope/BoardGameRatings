							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Troll Trouble</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The dark order of wizards have been bickering over who has the most gifted house elf. They have decided to organize a contest and send their naughty little house elves into an old mine to retrieve the magical golden egg of Eddenburg. The 1st elf to return to the Mine Entrance with the golden egg wins.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The hen that lays the golden eggs is protected by a giant and his body guards (a family of rock-hard ugly trolls). The giant and his bodyguards have been living in this same little mine shaft for over 300 years. Now as you can imagine the mine is really disgusting, there are germs everywhere, and not only germs but super germs. These super germs can cause diarrhea in house elves. As you can imagine it is hard for an elf to ride in the mine carts and sneak around quietly without their Pepto Bismo.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;As far as combat the trolls certainly have an advantage over the elves in strength, but they are stupid and sometimes completely forget who they are and what they are. They begin to waddle and walk around in circles mumbling to themselves. If these trolls had a brain they would be really dangerous.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Another interesting aspect of trolls is that when they see an elf they drool, and when I say drool I really mean drool. Because of this it is really difficult for an elf to sneak around because they are tracking mucus around on the bottoms of their boots, not to mention it is really slippery. On the positive side when a troll captures a house elf and drools all over it, it can become very slippery and sometimes&lt;br/&gt;it can squirm and slip free.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Two other techniques house elves have learned that are effective against trolls. First, trolls can't stand elves that squeak and second, trolls are particularly self conscious when elves flash them.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
