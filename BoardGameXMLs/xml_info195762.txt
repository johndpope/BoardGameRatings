							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Masks of Tzanti</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the high valley walls of Kesh, darkness is growing. The followers of the Vile Spore God Tzanti have stolen the dreams of the Nubaran Seeress Deja, trapping them in an eldritch artifact. She is now blind to the future, and her kingdom trembles in fear at what is to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those that wear the bronze masks of Tzanti sing now in praise to their lord, preparing a dark ritual that will bring forth the God's messenger from beyond. Unless her dreams are returned, the Seeress will descend into madness, and her people along with her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the land of Nubara, the people live and die by the prophecies of their chosen Seeress Deja, the holy servant of the Sun God. For many years, tensions had been growing between the Kingdom of Nubara and the Sand-Princes of Shen. The Seeress saw only blood and fire in a future of war, and worked hard to keep her King and her people on the path of peace and reason. Yet there were those who desired the chaos of war to visit Nubara.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These were not the Sand-Princes. It was the Cult of Tzanti, the Demon Prince of Fungus and Blight, who watched from afar and plotted Nubara's destruction. These men lived in the desert wastes of Kesh, the Land of Exiles. Long had they hated those that prospered in the Sun's light, and they saw an opportunity in the possibility of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Masks of Tzanti is a setting-neutral Pathfinder adventure for 5th level heroes set in a primal, raw land. Come to the rescue of the Seeress and save Nubara from war! This Menagerie Press adventure includes six pre-made heroes so that players can leap straight into action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
