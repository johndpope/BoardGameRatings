In Cefore, you play as intergalactic contractor Baro, and you are charged with demolishing structures around the galaxy in the most creative ways possible. As the structures get bigger, your methods of demolition must get more creative. Destroying structures rewards you with precious construction data. What better way to perform research than blowing stuff up?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have a large selection of tools and gadgets at your disposal that allow you to rip, bash, twist, and crush structures, and potentially yourself, to oblivion. Falling structures are a serious occupational hazard! Your hard hat doesn&amp;rsquo;t make you invulnerable, no matter how stylish it may be. Be careful while you&amp;rsquo;re out there on the job. Company insurance unfortunately only covers dental.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game is currently in Early Access.
