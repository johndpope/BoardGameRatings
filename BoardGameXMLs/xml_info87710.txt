			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book explores a common type of hazard in fantasy gaming: the pit trap. This often overlooked obstacle (no pun intended) is a staple of standard dungeon design in fantasy worlds. Many weaker monsters, such as goblins and kobolds, rely on the pit trap for its effectiveness in beefing up the defenses of their lair &amp;ndash; slowing the progress of (and hopefully debilitating) any would-be intruders. More powerful creatures use pit traps to capture prey, keep their prisoners contained, or in conjunction with other, more sinister traps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, this classic trap has become increasingly dismissed as clich&amp;eacute; &amp;ndash; a bit of old hat that can be easily avoided, disarmed, or survived. This supplement intends to challenge those presuppositions by presenting a wide range of options and enhancements for the common pit trap. To be sure, the old favorites of fantasy gaming are here, but the numerous options, as well as some new and unexpected twists on the pit trap concept itself, will add a fresh new dimension to using them. DMs should find inspiration here to include a wider variety of deadfalls and other perambulatory hazards to his or her game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
