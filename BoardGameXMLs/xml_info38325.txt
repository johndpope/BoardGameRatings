			<description>Translated from the manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A prison. It's where the shit jerks who did too much are put.&lt;br/&gt;A place where the rats who were either stupid or clumsy are kept separated from society until they cool down.&lt;br/&gt;No one, no matter how crazy, wants to go there.&lt;br/&gt;But there was one complete idiot who ended up in the special prison for violent maniacs.&lt;br/&gt;...and that's you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's defended by a system that Alcatraz or Bastilles don't come near. A huge hell, finely constructed and full of patrols.&lt;br/&gt;If you can get out of there, the next thing and you'll be able to break of out Hell itself.&lt;br/&gt;Even so, this is your line:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;So what. I have to do it.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;You have to, to save the guy on death roll, who was innocently judged.&lt;br/&gt;Use your skill, your genius and your brains to the fullest.&lt;br/&gt;What awaits you is unimportant. Your must save the man, get him out of there, think tactically, and use whatever tools you can get ahold of.&lt;br/&gt;Got it? Good. Let's get going.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
