			<description>Take a journey of a lifetime as you search the Kingdom of Eternia for the mysterious fortress of power and might, Castle Grayskull.  Follow a perilous trail where dangers and enemies lurk around each and every corner.  With the luck of the spin, land on special vehicle spaces that give you the opportunity to change player positions by revolving the game turntable.  As the tables are turned find yourself thrust forward into new lands or back in time to the start of your journey.  The first player to cross the forbidding draw bridge and enter the castle, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
