							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NFL American Football Card Game</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;American Football is one if Britain's fastest growing televised sports. Now you can bring all the razzmatazz and excitement of the NFL into your own front room - without the bruises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players aim to get rid of all their cards - but watch out, just as you are about to play the winning card there may be an interception.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting with a first down card players take it in turns to try and  play cards in sequence (1st down, 20 yard, 10 yard, Touchdown or 1st down, 40 yard, 50 yard punt). They may either play a sequential card featuring the team of the card before it or play another 1st down card featuring a different team. If a player cannot go they must exchange one card with the draw pile. Interception cards can be used as wild cards. The first person to play all their cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These jumbo cards feature the official illustrations representing five of the most famous teams from the football league in the 1980's: The Chicago Bears, The Washington Redskins, The Miami Dolphins, The Dallas Cowboys and The Pittsburgh Steelers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
