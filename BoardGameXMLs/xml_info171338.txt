			<description>Simple trick-taking game for youngsters. There are 32 cards, broken down into 4 sets of 8 cards. The cards are numbered (and have nice illustrations and text on them, none of which is relevant to the game-play). Every player gets 3 cards. Play is traditional with such games. A trick is won by the highest card played to a trick, unless it was trumped. Play continues until the last card is drawn from the deck. The player with the most tricks, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
