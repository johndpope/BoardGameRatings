							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle for Nethervein</name>
									
			<description>Set in a dark fantasy world full of steampunk inventions and Lovecraftian horror, Battle for Nethervein invites player to take the role of one of the world's mighty heroes and fight for one of the factions to achieve total victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is heavily inspired by the computer MOBA genre, but it tries to take a modern and action-packed approach. Players divide into two teams, each fighting for either The Syndicate or The Swarm. During the game, you control only your hero, which gets stronger and gains new skills as the game goes on. Your actions influence what happens on the battlefield: You can fight on the frontline to push it to opposing towers to raze them down or fulfill quests around the board. The game focuses on fluid action gameplay and utilizes simultaneous movement-choosing and combat-planning so that you can bluff out your opponent. Enjoy an epic fight with up to five friends!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
