			<description>[From Wikipedia : &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Rock&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Rock&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chuck Rock is a slapstick side-scrolling platform video game of the early to mid 1990s, which was initially created by Core Design in 1991 and was subsequently ported to a large number of home consoles of the time over the next few years.&lt;br/&gt;Chuck Rock was both developed and published by Core Design in 1991 for the Atari ST and Amiga computers, and a year after, in 1992, for the Commodore 64, and in 1994 for the Amiga CD32. The game was subsequently published by Krisalis Software for the Acorn Archimedes. Virgin Interactive published the game for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, Sega Master System, and the Sega Game Gear. Sony Imagesoft published the game for the Sega Mega CD, Nintendo SNES, and Game Boy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1994, the game was among the most popular games for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. The character of Chuck Rock himself was an iconic early character for Core Design before the introduction of Lara Croft in the 1996 game Tomb Raider, and the character of Chuck Rock himself and his family even featured in some UK comic books of the 1990s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chuck Rock spawned two other video game sequels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
