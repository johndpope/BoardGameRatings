							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Races of Obsidian Twilight</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From out of the dark and forbidding heavens a great meteor, black as night itself, carved through Abaddon&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere, calved into massive sections and rained down upon the world in great shards. It obliterated cities, shattered the living rock, sent tidal waves swamping over islands and drowning the coasts, ignited volcanoes and set the ground quaking for more than a year. Over 85% of the sentient population of Abaddon was killed in moments and no sorcery, no prayer, no force of arms nor cunning with the builder&amp;rsquo;s craft could stand against the destruction. Those who survived found themselves in the ruins of civilization, surrounded by the corpses of their nations, overwhelmed by death and living beneath a soot-black sky. From these ashes came the race that would eventually dominated the landscape of Abaddon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Races of Obsidian Twilight includes:&lt;br/&gt;    All the information on the standard SRD races in the Obsidian Twilight setting (Dwarves, Elves, Gnomes, and Halflings) including personality, game mechanics and relations&lt;br/&gt;    All the information on the original race in the Obsidian Twilight setting (Exalted, Genesai, Harrowed, Infernal, Khymer, Lykian, Osirian, Raijin) including personality, game mechanics and relations&lt;br/&gt;    Over 40 new and original feats exclusive to Obsidian Twilight&lt;br/&gt;    Character Sheet&lt;br/&gt;    Miniatures Counters&lt;br/&gt;    Initiative and Monster Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
