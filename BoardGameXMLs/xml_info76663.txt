							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tower of the Stargazer</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legends tell of a wizard so arrogant that he felt the entire sky was naught but a lens for him to view the stars. So great was the hubris and defiance of this man that the gods smote him with the power of storm and fire. Oh did the wizard laugh at such a pathetic gesture. He did not fear the gods, for he drew his knowledge from something greater. Something darker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The legend of this wizard grew, first whispered by men in fear, and later in awe. The wizard, they said, attacked the gods just as they had attacked him. And his joy only grew as the land around him died.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But then there was no more news. No more talk. Something had finally brought the wizard low, for though the sky still blazed down on him and his abode, he no longer blazed back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And now you're going to walk right through this wizard's front door.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tower of the Stargazer is a specially designed introductory module with material specifically for beginning Referees, with notes detailing not only what is included in the adventure, but why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Beginning Players, Characters, and Referees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first print run was 800 copies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
