			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Math Blaster Plus is an upgraded reimagining of Math Blaster. The interface was redesigned to be more user-friendly, new gameplay features were added, and the system was taken out of BASIC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like its predecessor, Math Blaster Plus! covers five math subjects &amp;ndash; addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and fractions. The updated game, however, also includes five different play styles:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ignition &amp;ndash; Problems appear and congratulatory messages are shown when a correct answer is given. Players have 2 chances to correctly answer each question before the solution is given. A score is provided at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Countdown &amp;ndash; A completed problem is shown and, when prompted, the problem is shown again without the answer. Players must then correctly answer the question. There is no time limit or scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lift-Off &amp;ndash; This game plays similarly to Ignition, but instead of problems missing answers, they are missing other sections (ex. _ + 3 = 7). Also, players are given 3 chances to answer correctly instead of 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orbit &amp;ndash; Three completed problems are shown on-screen broken into boxes. Some boxes require corrections, and each successful correction earns a star. Players have 2 chances to answer correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blasternaut &amp;ndash; The game that is most similar to the original, players control a Blasternaut and must choose the rocket aimed at the correct answer for each problem. Points are awarded for each correct answer, and bonus points are earned by saving other Blasternauts in space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An editor program is included to allow customization of the lessons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
