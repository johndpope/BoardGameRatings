			<description>Young children's game related to both Snap and Memory but with differences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has 72 tiles. 36 of them are all the same shape and feature various images. The other 36 tiles match the object on the same shape tiles but these tiles are not rectangular, they are loosely the shape of the object in question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place all the same shape tiles into the cardboard container. Lay out all the other tiles face-up around the table. At the word go, players hunt through the container looking for a tile that matches (the image) any exposed tile on the table. First to get three matches wins the round and cries &amp;quot;Halt!&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The same-shaped tiles are perfect for also playing a straight-forward Memory game or a game of Snap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
