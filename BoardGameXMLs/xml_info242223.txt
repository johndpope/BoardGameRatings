							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cannon Fodder 3</name>
									
			<description>Cannon Fodder 3 is an action-strategy PC game developed and published &amp;ndash; originally in Russia &amp;ndash; by Game Factory Interactive (GFI), along with developer Burut CT. The game is the second sequel to Cannon Fodder, a commercially and critically successful game released for multiple formats in 1993. Jon Hare and his company Sensible Software, the developers of Cannon Fodder and its prior sequel, were uninvolved with Cannon Fodder 3. GFI instead licensed the intellectual property from now-owner Codemasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a combination of action and strategy involving a small number of soldiers battling enemy terrorists. The protagonists are heavily outnumbered and easily killed. The player must rely on strategy and heavy secondary weapons to overcome enemies, their vehicles and installations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cannon Fodder 3 was released in Russia in December 2011 and &amp;ndash; via download service GamersGate &amp;ndash; Europe and North America on 9 February 2012, receiving mixed reviews. Reviewers found the game to be enjoyable but limited and repetitive. The graphics and humour received both positive and negative criticism. Critics derided the poor English translations as well as technical problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cannon Fodder 3&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
