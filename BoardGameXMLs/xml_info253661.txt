			<description>Per&amp;uacute; Cocina is a card game about famous Peruvian dishes. Claiming dish cards requires playing all the necessary ingredient cards in the correct order. Each ingredient card shows two different ingredients (in a Dominos style design) of which you can use only one in any given situation, so players have to think carefully which side to use. A player on their turn either places a card or cards near a dish to help preparing it, or places one of their cards into an open pool where anyone can use it. When a player places the last ingredient card for a dish, they claim the card which scores points at the end of the game. The player who finished the most valuable dishes is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
