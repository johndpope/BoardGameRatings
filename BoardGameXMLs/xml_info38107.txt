							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Blazers: The Quest for Isacandar</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;In the year 2199, Earth is under attack from an alien race called the Gamilons. Gamilon planet bombs covered the earth with a deadly radioactive pollution and the surface of the earth is now unlivable. All life on Earth has moved underground. But even there, far below the earth's surface, the deadly radiation poisoning is beginning to reach them.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Now all life on Earth has just one year left to live. But there is hope. On the planet Iscandar, there is a machine called the Cosmo DNA which can remove the radioactivity and restore Earth to it's natural state. The Star Force must travel 148,000 light years and back in just one earth year or all life on Earth will become extinct. But the Gamilons are determined to stop the Star Force at all costs.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Star Blazers Card game for two players. One player uses the Star Force Deck. The other player uses the Gamilon Deck.&amp;quot; The Star Blazers player must travel the 148 parsecs to the planet Iscandar before the start of turn 20 to win the game, otherwise the Gamilon player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
