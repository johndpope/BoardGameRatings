			<description>&amp;quot;Spiele Minis&amp;quot; is a series of small surprise boxes (i.e., you don't know what you get) from Ravensburger. They are meant to be carry-on or gifts, suitable for children (&amp;quot;Mitbringspiel&amp;quot;). Some of the cubes contain actual games, others contain magic tricks, puzzles etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 14 cards with different objects and 12 chips in the middle of the table. All players look at them and try to memorize them. On a player turn all other players must close their eyes and the player will hide one of the cards. Then players open their eyes and try to guess which card is missing. If they do they get a chip. If they say the wrong object they lose a chip. The first player to get 3 chips will win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
