			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come Sail Away!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sea is calling, and Ultimate Ships is the perfect resource to make your aquatic adventures amazing in your 5E campaign! This incredible expansion brings you everything you need to expand the nautical optinos in our campaign, with with rules for shipboard combat, simple and advanced ship-to-ship combat, and easy-to-use fleet battles! You&amp;rsquo;ll find detailed options for ships large and small from ancient times to the Age of Sail, with naval siege weapons from cannons to catapults, ballistas to firedrakes, as well as special ship modfications like concealed weapon ports, silk sails, and smuggling compartments. Add in spell effects on ships, shore bombardment rules, ramming, repairs, boarding actions, plus tons of sample ships, and you can play at the level of detail that suits your game and your players, from simple to complex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mass combat rules for 5th Edition in Kingdoms, Ultimate Battle, and Ultimate War from Legendary Games offer a terrific integrated system of kingdom management, nation-building, and battles on sea, sky, and land, but if you&amp;rsquo;d like to run a fun and fast fleet battle without quite that level of detail you&amp;rsquo;ll love the fleet battle rules presented here. Form up your squadrons and bring out your fleet for fast-paced skirmishes at sea, with plenty of tactical options to make every sea battle unique but without bogging down in complexity. Drive to the enemy flagship and bring out your heroes to face down their foes on deck and claim the spoils of victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Ships helps you bring the classic adventure voyage to life in your 5E game with a wealth of material, but its modular design also makes it easy to use as much or as little as you like. Whether you create a full-fledged nautical campaign or just need concise, detailed rules to handle an ocean journey or riverboat cruise, this book is an encyclopedic addition to your 5E gaming library!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
