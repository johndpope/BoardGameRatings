			<description>The board is 11 spaces square. The outer squares are not used except for the corner &amp;lsquo;home base&amp;rsquo; squares.  In the center is a 3 square x 3 square scroll zone, which includes four 'sleeping men'.  Each player starts with nine counters.  These may be moved either 1 or 4 squares each turn in a straight line in any direction but may not jump over any other pieces.  Pieces are captured if they are sandwiched between two pieces of one other player of if the piece becomes the third piece in a diagonal formation.  Captured pieces entitle a player to reclaim pieces previously lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three levels of winning.  Basic - by eliminating all of your opponent's pieces.  A scroll win - make the scroll zone entirely your color.  A Grand scroll - make the scroll zone entirely your color, but without using your sleeping man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
