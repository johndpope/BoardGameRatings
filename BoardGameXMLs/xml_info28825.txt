							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strawberry Shortcake Stick-Ons Game</name>
									
			<description>For Ages 3 - 8&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Huckleberry Pie has just zoomed all over Strawberryland on his skateboard and is now starving for a berry sweet goodie. What luck- Strawberry Shortcake and her friends just so happen to be out gathering as many berries as they can to make the ultimate strawberry shortcake that everyone can enjoy. There are so many jucy berries around, Strawberry Shortcake and her friends Ginger Snap, Orange Blossom, and Angel Cake can't wait to get started! The problem is that little sister Apple Dumpling and frisky Pupcake can sometimes get in the way. Oh, watch out! Every so often Apple Dumping giggles and drops an apple into the basket instead of a strawberry. Pupcake is a curious pet and after sniffing the basket, he can't help but eat up the berries! Oh no- there go all the berries! The first player to collect 8 strawberries and take a delicious strawberry shortcake to Huckelberry Pie wins the game!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
