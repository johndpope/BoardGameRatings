							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Pigeon Wants a Match</name>
									
			<description>First the Pigeon wanted to drive a bus. Then the Pigeon found a hot dog. Now the Pigeon wants a match in this new game from University Games. Based on the Pigeon book series by Mo Willems, The Pigeon Wants a Match Game finds players trying to collect the most matches of hilarious images from the books. Color-coded borders and backgrounds make pairing tiles easy and fun for even the youngest matchers. The game is designed to help develop visual literacy and coordination skills. This game brings the fun of the books to kids in a new way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The difference between The Pigeon Wants a Match and Memory is that The Pigeon Wants a Match has a tile that will allow you to gain an extra turn and one that will force you to lose a turn if you turn over a certain tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
