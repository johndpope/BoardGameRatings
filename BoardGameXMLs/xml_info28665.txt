							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dodge Bowl</name>
									
			<description>Dodge Bowl is a novel dexterity game from Nash Games.  In this you set-up 5 'bowling' pins on your side of the board and 3 blocking cubes in the center of the board.  &lt;br/&gt;     The object is to knock down your opponents pins first.  This is done by rolling a marble through a curved tube from your side of the board.  The rules are simple and the game is a fun way to pass the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
