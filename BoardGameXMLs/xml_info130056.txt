			<description>This is a nicely produced game with sturdy plastic tiles, that are laid out to form pleasing patterns. The aim is to play out tiles so as to score a cuble which happens when the three adjacent numbers form a sum (like 7, 4, 3 which is 3 + 4 = 7). The rules and game play are easy, but keep everyone alert and engaged. There is scope for a little tactical play by seeing what numbers are still available. A fun way to learn some maths and enjoy family time together.
