			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Le Mystere De Kikekankoi&amp;quot; is a text adventure game. You have received a message from a mysterious woman asking you to rescue her from her captor. You drive 500 kilometres to the place she mentioned. Now you stand before the entrance of a cave, ready to solve the mystery or die trying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a text adventure that was first published for Oric Atmos computers. This version has updated graphics, but it remains a text game, with a text interpreter knowing 140 words according to the manual. The player must enter the cave and resolve puzzles to reach the mysterious woman and free her. There are lots of ways to die and the game doesn't have a save feature (it was later republished with a modification allowing to save to a floppy disk but the implementation was buggy).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
