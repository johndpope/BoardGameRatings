			<description>&amp;quot;Welcome to the world of publishing: As a publisher of the Weekly Rag, thousands of readers look to you for news and gossip. Your tabloid is seeking to have the best stories in the business. Deal the cards and write some headlines!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Self-published game consisting of 96 word cards, a few blank cards and a couple of quick-reference cards. Each word card has 4 different words on it along with either a positive sign ( + ) or a negative sign ( - ). Words are articles, nouns, verbs, adjectives or adverbs. Different symbols correspond to the different parts of speech.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone is dealt 10 cards face down (your personal pile) and players then draw 3 of those cards to form a hand. Remaining cards form a draw pile. On your turn, you may start a headline with a noun or article card, add a card to your headline (following normal sentence structure), add a card to someone else's headline (if you have a headline of your own started) or pass (and draw a card from the draw pile). If you use a card from your hand, you draw a card from your personal pile. Headlines must start with a noun or article and must contain at least 2 nouns and 1 verb. The headline is completed and set aside when the second noun is placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The round continues until a player runs out of cards from both their personal pile and their hand. Each player then scores their completed headlines. Incomplete headlines do not score any points. Subtract the number of negative cards from the number of positive cards in the headline. If the result is positive, this is your score. If the result is negative, take the absolute value as your score (e.g. you get 4 points for a score of -4).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach a score of 10 wins the game. However, &amp;quot;The primary purpose of RAG is to be entertaining. Many of the headlines will be funny. Some of them will be VERY funny! Enjoy the game and laugh a lot. Laughing is good for you!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
