			<description>Samurai Ghost (known in Japan as Genpei Tōma Den: Kannoni (源平討魔伝 巻ノ弐, lit. &amp;quot;Genpei Defeats Demon Story: The Second Volume&amp;quot;)) is a 1992 action game released by Namco for the TurboGrafx-16. The game is the sequel to Genpei Tōma Den, and is the first game in the series to be released outside Japan. It was released on the Wii's Virtual Console in North America on October 29, 2007 and in Europe on November 2 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with the first game, Genpei Tōma Den, the player controls the resurrected samurai Taira no Kagekiyo, defeating demons and monsters across several levels. Given his undead nature, Kagekiyo has access to supernatural powers such as levitation and the ability to cast energy projectiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Samurai Ghost is very similar plot-wise to its prequel, in that the plot revolves around Kagekiyo, who has been resurrected once again and fights against Minamoto no Yoshitsune, Saitō Musashibō Benkei, and his arch enemy Minamoto no Yoritomo. However, in Samurai Ghost, Kagekiyo also faces Minamoto no Yoshinaka (Also known as Kiso no Yoshinaka), who commits seppuku when defeated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Samurai Ghost&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
