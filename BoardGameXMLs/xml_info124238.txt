			<description>Simple trivia game with questions on the Soccer World Cup 2002.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: board, 55 cards with 6 questions per card, 1 die, 6 pawns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How it is played: The die decides which question (number 1-6) on the current card the active player has to answer. 4 possible answers are provided. If the active player chooses the correct answer, he/she moves his/her pawn one space forward. If the answer is wrong, the pawn is moved one space back. 3 times per game each player may use a joker, which means that the player who reads the question reduces the answer options to two. The player who is first to reach the ninth and final space on the board wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
