							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Toy Odyssey: The Lost and Found</name>
									
			<description>Toy Odyssey is a Metroidvania style action-platformer that takes you back to a world made from the nightmares of your childhood. Join Brand&amp;mdash;an action figure that has come to life&amp;mdash;in his fight against the darkness to save his owner, Felix. Nightmares are only the start of his troubles: Brand needs to uncover the secrets of the house before it's too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore the entire house, combat chaos, and save other toys in the battle against evil. Create a huge arsenal and upgrade any item you find. Build the ultimate bedroom fortress to keep the darkness at bay. Unravel the house's mysterious past, and learn to overcome all odds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;â€‹Toy Odyssey is fundamentally an action-adventure platformer. The player spends the night exploring a randomly-generated house, defeating bosses in each of the unique rooms, and then going up against the final boss. Every time your character fails, the night ends and the darkness grows stronger. The goal is to accumulate enough resources to strengthen yourself and build up defenses in order to vanquish the evil that corrupted this house&amp;mdash;all before it reaches you and Felix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Randomly-generated adventure means endless replayablility. No night in the house is the same as before&lt;br/&gt;By chance, you may find valuable items, bypass hazardous parts of the house, and more. The dynamic environment also plays a big part in whether or not you can defeat your enemies or complete a puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
