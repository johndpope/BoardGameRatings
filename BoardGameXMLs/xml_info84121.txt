			<description>From the back of the package:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE STRUGGLE TO BECOME SHOGUN&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Japan most people do not know about. The warring states period of the sixteenth century. Central government was weak and ineffective as feudal lords called daimyos gained power. Each daimyo ruled a single fief, each wanted to become shogun and rule the entire nation. One man, Nobunaga Oda, came close but failed. He paid the price for failure, death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nobunaga's Ambition is a military, economic and diplomatic simulation for one to eight players that puts you in Nobunaga's place. You start with one fief and try to take the entire nation. A game of both strategy and tactics, success takes both careful planning and opportunism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Administer your fiefs during peace to increase their strength. Keep your peasants and army loyal or risk revolt. Use your resources effectively, not spending too much on either guns or butter. Negotiate with other daimyos, or perhaps you'd rather just send ninja. On the battlefield, control your troops in close tactical detail. Take advantage of terrain, attack, retreat, fight a war of attrition, or go directly after the enemy general. Just be sure your side is smarter, tougher and better prepared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nobunaga's ambition is fast moving, easy to play and historically accurate. Characters and game events come from the reality of sixteenth century Japan. Maps are almost entirely accurate, both geographically and politically. Advanced graphics and animation help give the game a feel of complete reality. One to eight may play either of two scenarios and five different levels of difficulty. Instruction manual and historical notes included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
