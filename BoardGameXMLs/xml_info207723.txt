			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another multiplatform joystick by SpectraVideo's QuickShot label.&lt;br/&gt;This is a joystick most people either love or hate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Python-1 series there are at least two models; the difference here is digital (Python-1 QS-130F) or analouge (Python-1M QS-137F) micro switches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The joystick have a &amp;quot;modern classic&amp;quot;, ergonomic jet fighter handle with two fire-buttons; One for the thumb and one for the index finger. Under the thumb botton is found a blue switch for Auto-fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QuickShot Python-1 was originally released for a handfull of home computers. With Python-1M more were added to the fan.&lt;br/&gt;For NES and SNES, Python-2 (QS-130N) and Python-2B (QS-197E) was made - these had some differences compared to Python-1:&lt;br/&gt;Python 2 / QS-130N for Nintendo Entertainment System; two blue buttons is added next to the thumb fire button.&lt;br/&gt;Python 2B / QS-197E for Super Nintendo Entertainment System was white instead of black. The red index button stayed red, but the red thumb button changed shape and colour to Yellow. The buttons added next to got an arrowed shape and was green (left side) and blue (right side). The base got six small, gray buttons added.
