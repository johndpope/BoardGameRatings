			<description>Gemville is a game in which players have to collect the most gems to fulfill their current orders. Every player wins money depending on the place they are when the supervisor reaches the end of the track (the most complete order gives more money to this player, etc.). The game goes in three rounds. Players can invest in gaining influence and prestige trough cards they can win. Influence gives special abilities and Prestige allows players to use special actions in the up side of the board. Most of the cards also gives money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays essentially with a worker placement system. After selecting the actions and perform them (each player plays 2 workers per turn), the discs used to do so are placed under the track establishing the new turn order (the more to the right a player disc is, the first he will replace it the next turn).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 7 main actions to choose. Some of them can be used by more than 1 player. In the city of Gemville players not only prospect in the mine (a bag full of gems), but they are forced to use the black market, use the trading market or even buy gems in the town jewelry to fulfill their current needs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gemville plays in 20 minutes per player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
