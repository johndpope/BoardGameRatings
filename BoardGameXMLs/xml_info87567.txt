			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Khnorg, the son of the emperor has been captured by barbarians while exploring an uncharted planet. You are a droid sent to bring the prince back. You quickly find out that the only way the barbarian chief will free his captive is if you bring him back the sacred sword. Problem is, the sword has been broken in six parts, each held by a different person, and each one want something in return. Not only that, but the planet is infested by overly aggressive defence robots who won't let you travel easily...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sky Hunter is a mix of adventure and arcade game. The player travel from location to location, looking for the owners of the sword fragments and the items they want in exchange. Whenever a new location is entered, there is an arcade sequence in which the player must destroy a defence robot. Once eliminated, the place is secured and can be entered again without problem. Some locations have items (only one item can be carried at any given time), others have people claiming to have a sword fragment to trade (some of them lie and don't give anything in exchange for the item). The player must monitor the droid's energy bar (which diminishes when hit by defence robots) and fuel level (moving from one location to another expends fuel and there is no way to find more).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
