			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a member of the elite AMC (&amp;quot;Astro Marine Corps&amp;quot;) you've been sent to the planet Dendar. Your goal is to stop the Deathbringers invasion. Once the invasion force is destroyed, use their ship to travel to their own planet and end their threat once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AMC is a side-scroller action game using Dinamic's &amp;quot;FX Doble Carga&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;FX double charge&amp;quot;) system: the game is split in two part, the second part being unlockable by a code given after finishing the first part. Both parts' gameplay is similar (run to the left of the screen while killing enemies and picking up power-ups), only the enemies and power ups available are different. Though the player has an energy bar that diminishes when hit by enemies and that can be refilled by picking the appropriate power-up, there are lots of instant death traps, requiring the player to memorize the sequence of traps and creatures of the level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical note:&lt;br/&gt;The game engine uses Parallax scrolling, a feature many experts said to be impossible to implement on 8 bit machines like the Amstrad CPC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
