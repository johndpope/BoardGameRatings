			<description>This is a tile laying game that has math at its base. The object of the game is to be the first one to get rid of your numbers by making examples. There are three kinds of tiles: Number tiles from 0 to 9, equal sign tiles, and math function tiles (+, -, X, and /).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game the number tiles are randomly drawn by the players until they have all been drawn. The function tiles are left face down to be drawn one at a time when its your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you try to make a math equation using your number tiles and the function tile that you drew this turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example you have numbers 0, 1, 4, 6 in your hand and you draw a + tile. On your turn you would  pick up an = tile and then play  4 + 6 = 1 0. The next player would then build off of the original equation either horizontally or vertically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
