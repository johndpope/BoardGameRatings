							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ground Pounders:  The STAR CORPS Card Game</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ground Pounders is a card game of STAR CORPS combat.  It simulates the battles of the Corporate-Colonial Wars of the late 22nd Century.  It simulates those battles on a scale much larger than the STAR CORPS miniatures rules normally allow, with most Force Cards representing a Company (which is 4-10 squads).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User description&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with large Force Cards face up in front of each player. Each Force Card has both a Victory Point and Hit Point value. Once enough damage has been done to a card to equal or exceed it's Hit Points, the unit is eliminated and the player who eliminated it gains it's Victory Point value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are also dealt a hand of smaller Action Cards which are not revealed when dealt. Action Cards are generally played to inflict damage to enemy units, although some activate other effects such as healing friendly units or allowing a player to draw additional cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games may be played either until a player has reached a set Victory Point total, or until only one player has units remaining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
