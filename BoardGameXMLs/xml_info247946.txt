							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hive Smashers</name>
									
			<description>Deep within the heart of the planet Insectivus, the Bee Clan and the Wasp Clan battle for supremacy. Both sides pit their fiercest warriors against one another in the hope of weakening or taking control of their enemy&amp;rsquo;s hive. Every hive that falls brings the war one step closer to ending.... Side with the honorable Bees wielding weapons of polished gold or align with the villainous Wasps, feral warriors of the badlands. But whatever you do...Protect the Queen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hive Smashers is a two-player card game using hexagonal cards to wage war. Each opponent creates a hive by circling his or her queen with strong warriors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once that's complete, each player takes turns laying a card down and then picking one up from the reserve pile. Laying a card down means covering an opponent's card on either hive. This is done with higher numbered cards. If a player lays down a card that strengthens their hive or weakens their opponents, then they are allowed to pick up an &amp;quot;Action&amp;quot; card. Action cards help players build tunnels or smash tunnels. If a tunnel is created to their opponent's queen (in the center) then a smash card can be placed on the queen to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But watch out, your opponent can do the same thing. On your turn, you must decide whether to strengthen the numbers in your hive, or attack your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
