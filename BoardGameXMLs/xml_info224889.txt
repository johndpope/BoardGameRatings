			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Immortal Fighter of the Innocent&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite being one of the most talented martial artists in the world, Jonathan Rockford was seen as nothing more than a Hollywood B-movie action star. John&amp;rsquo;s life turned towards the strange when he was invited to compete in a tournament of Immortal Fighters. John was delighted to participate; believing that the prize of &amp;quot;immortality&amp;quot; was meant as fame and glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the end, John faced down the final challenge: the black dragon Xuanlong. With his final punch, he felled the beast and its essence transferred to the victorious fighter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, the other Immortal Fighters were not finished with the champion. They followed him, seeking his prize, and endangering innocents with their deadly weapons and battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To protect mankind from the antics of these Immortal Fighters, Jonathan retreated from the public eye. At night, however, Jonathan adopted the identity of &amp;ldquo;Dragon Fist: Immortal Fighter of the Innocent.&amp;rdquo; (PL 9)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Jonathan&amp;rsquo;s girlfriend, Porsche Pembrose, helped found White Hats Incorporated, Jonathan supported her as a partner and employee. As Dragon Fist, Jonathan has sworn to use his fighting skills to help others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iconic Legends. Because sometimes you a need a character everyone knows, even if they're meeting them for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
