			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many kinds of war, and sometimes the quiet orderly wars are the most world-shaking. Super soldiers with the right feat choices and gear have always been able to take on whole battalions; modern mages can reshape reality with their spells and force of will. Charismatic heroes and media personalities could be warriors too, using words, art and force of personality to win battles, con marks and live the good life. Until now though, social combat and interaction lagged behind run and gun action. The D20 Modern engine was designed to emulate action movies: its inspirations were equal Buffy the Vampire slayer and Rainbow Six. The new feats and classes presented here change all that. This supplement has all new materials including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     2 New Advanced Classes: The Advocate &amp;amp; Corporate Raider.&lt;br/&gt;     Over 30 new feats including Diplomatic Immunity, Insinuation and Retained Council&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 17 page PDF is just the sort of thing needed for GMs to add depth to any great d20 Modern campaign world, including Haven: City of Violence and Sanctuary: City of Secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
