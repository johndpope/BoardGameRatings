			<description>Hey man, what are you doing sitting there? We've got asteroids to drill and gems to collect! Get off yer seat warmer and get your Laser Turret ready! We've got 90 levels to drill through, all with unique properties: how fast the asteroids fall, how many asteroids there are, different colored asteroids, and a few more surprises! I need you to catch the asteroids with your Laser Turret and guide them into their matching vacuum tubes...all the while grinding off excess rock to get extra points. So what are you waiting for, you'd better get to gettin' while the gettin's good!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AstroDriller3020 is a whacky physics based puzzle game that is simple and easy to get into, but has hidden depth and strategy. The goal is to help the lovably gruff AstroDrillers collect precious gems from within different colored asteroids. To do this, you must use your Laser Turrets to guide the asteroids into the matching vacuum tubes while grinding off as much excess rock as you can. The more rock you grind off the asteroid, the more valuable the gem inside it will be! Drill through 90 unique levels while upgrading your abilities in this colorful and crazy take on the puzzle genre!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
