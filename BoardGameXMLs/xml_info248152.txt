							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Connect with Pieces: The Lone Ranger</name>
									
			<description>The jigsaw puzzle you can play three ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Connect With Pieces, each piece is embossed with one of five special symbols. Match up the symbols to score points! Block your opponent from scoring. Many pieces can fit in more than one place, so the game will always be different. And because the symbols are pressed in, not printed, the final image is never obscured, Which means you can put it together like a regular jigsaw puzzle, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 700-piece puzzle measures 27&amp;times;20 when complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
