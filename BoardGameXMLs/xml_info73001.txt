							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Descent: Road to Legend Lieutenants â€“ Lord Merick Farrow</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the package:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mighty Overlord treading the path of legend needs strong leaders to oversee his many minions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring your Road to Legend Lieutenant tokens alive with 3D minis!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Lord Merick Farrow's brother Sir Alric died in battle, it was a tragedy for all Free Cities. However, when Lord Merick struck a deal with the dark powers to get his brother back, it foretold their doom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cost: 10.&lt;br/&gt;Avatar: Any Avatar.&lt;br/&gt;Power: 15 Threat.&lt;br/&gt;Minions: 4 Skeletons, 3 Sorcerers, 1 Manticore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He costs five fewer conquest tokens to play if you have Sir Alric Farrow in play.  He has +6 range and Blast 1 and may pay five movement points to move to any space in his line of sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
