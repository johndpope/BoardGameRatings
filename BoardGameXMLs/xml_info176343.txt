			<description>LEXI Card Game is a new word game. There are 55 cards in one deck of LEXI Card Game. There are 52 letter cards; the number of each letter of the alphabet in the deck is according to the frequency of usage for each letter in the English language. There are two WILD cards which may be substituted for any letter of the alphabet. There is one (shortened) Rules/Score card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, the players set a goal of whatever score to be reached to win. (The winning score may be 100, 200, 500, etc.) Every player takes turns dealing. All players get nine cards each at the beginning of the game. One card is flipped open next to the deck, and both are placed at the center of play. The first player draws from either the deck or the opened card, but not both. He may lay down one or more words to be scored at the end of the round; he does not have to lay down any words. When this player is done, he discards one card. Play moves to the next player. All players will take turns playing. When it is a player's turn, he either draws one card from the deck or pick up card(s) from the open discarded pile. If the player draws from the discarded pile, he has to pick up all the cards from the card he wants to the latest discarded one and take it (or them) into his hand. This player has to play the bottom (oldest discarded) card he picks up and spell a word with it. He can, but does not have to spell words with the rest of the letter cards he picks up. When this player is done laying down words in front of him, he must discard one card. A player may add to an existing word he has laid down in a previous turn--by adding a prefix or a suffix--to form a longer word. For example: A player has laid down &amp;quot;ALL&amp;quot; in one turn, and has &amp;quot;E&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;R&amp;quot; in his hand. In a subsequent turn, he picks up &amp;quot;T&amp;quot;. This player may add to the existing word, &amp;quot;ALL&amp;quot; and form &amp;quot;TALLER&amp;quot;. A player may only play and add to his own words and no one else's. For words to count toward a score, the words must be laid down in front of the player during his turn. If the words are not laid down when the round ends, those letters (forming a word) left in a player's hand will not count toward scoring. Moreover, one (1) point will be deducted for every letter left in a player's hand. All players must have taken at least one turn to spell words before the round may be ended. Only the player whose turn it is may end the round. To end a round, a player must use all his cards to spell one or more words, except one which must be discarded. Scores are added up according to the Summation principle:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 letter word = 1 point; 2 letter words = 1+2= 2 points; 3 letter words = 1+2+3= 6 points; 4 letter words = 1+2+3+4= 10 points; 5 letter words = 1+2+3+4+5= 15 points; 6 letter words = 1+2+3+4+5+6 =21 points, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players play a new round and add up the scores. Rounds are played until the set score is reached. The first player to reach the set score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
