			<description>Ennichi no Tatsujin (縁日の達人lit. &amp;quot;Festival Master&amp;quot;) is a video game for Nintendo's Wii console. It was a launch title in Japan. The game is composed of several minigames, all of which revolve around Japanese festivals. This is Namco's first Wii game. It is a spin-off the Taiko no Tatsujin series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is composed of several minigames, including:&lt;br/&gt;-Kingyo Sukui: Use the Wii Remote to control a virtual net and grab goldfish from a tank.&lt;br/&gt;-Shateki: The Wii Remote becomes a gun, used to fire at bottles.&lt;br/&gt;-Takoyaki: Takoyaki (fried octopus) is a favorite treat amongst the Japanese. The Wii Remote is used to flip the Takoyaki balls over.&lt;br/&gt;-Darts: Throw darts, striking targets in the specified order.&lt;br/&gt;-Balloon Art: Use the Wii Remote and Nunchuk to twist a balloon into shapes. Movements must be timed to coincide with the background music.&lt;br/&gt;-Yo-yo Tsuri: The Wii Remote is used to aim a paper string and hook onto balls in a bucket of water. The trick is to keep the string from tearing apart.&lt;br/&gt;-Wanage: Toss rings to grab prizes. Rings are tossed by shaking the Wii Remote.&lt;br/&gt;-Uranai no Yakata: This is a fortune tellers house. The Wii Remote and Nunchuk are used to make a pair of virtual hands grasp a crystal fortune ball and hear a fortune for the day.&lt;br/&gt;-Crepe: Make the sweet using the Wii Remote. There is a limited amount of time to reach a target number of crepes, and the exact toppings requested by your customers must be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ennichi no Tatsujin&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
