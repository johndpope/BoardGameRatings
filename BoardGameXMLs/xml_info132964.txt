			<description>A 15 year old boy named Hiroshi Kuzumi recently moved into a new town in the mountains. The town is separated into new and old streets by a river and many mysterious local cultures still remain. The towns people are unusually friendly to him but one person kept her distance from him: class committee member Kushinada Nemuru. In their few encounters she gave him a word of advice: &amp;quot;Stay away from the old streets.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hiroshi learns about the town's local traditions and legends, most prominently the ones about the local Wolf Spirits. However, something mysterious goes on in the background; people mysteriously &amp;quot;move away&amp;quot; and students suddenly &amp;quot;transfer schools&amp;quot; while none of the locals pay any attention. Hiroshi initially tries to ignore it, but he soon sees a girl with an enormous scythe along with people in strange masks kill someone that was written off to have &amp;quot;moved away&amp;quot; the next day. Hiroshi is soon drawn into the dark secrets long hidden by the townsfolk and uncovers a plot to destroy the town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Ckami_Kakushi,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Ckami_Kakushi,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
