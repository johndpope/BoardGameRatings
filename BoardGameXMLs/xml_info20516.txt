			<description>This is a very rare Boardgame designed by Wolfgang Kramer for a German Pay TV - channel named &amp;quot;Premiere&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 Board&lt;br/&gt;1 Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;6 Player figures&lt;br/&gt;5 Film Company disks&lt;br/&gt;105 Playing Cards (15 Joker)&lt;br/&gt;27 Event Cards&lt;br/&gt;5 Dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Players take the roll of filmproducers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cards and disks are divided in 5 different film types:&lt;br/&gt;Love, Western, Science-Fiction, Comedy and Action&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards show values from 1-6&lt;br/&gt;Every type of film could only be played on the same type of film except Jokers, which could be played on every type of film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every round everybody choses one type of film and draws a card from the chosen type. The Starting player can draw 2 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then he must roll all 5 dice and move forward with every single film company with exact one dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a film company lands on a yello field a film is produced and starting with the player left from the starting player everyone could play cards from the same type of film and jokers. The player with the highest value on his cards gets the most points, the second... Nothing New ;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then anybody who played cards on this movie must discard one card and take back the others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all but one film company completed the first round on the board the last film company is discarded for the rest of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the point-track on the board are some special fields like&lt;br/&gt;Random Events (Event Cards), Bonus Points or Loose some points, so sometimes it could be better, to produce a bad film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game ends, if at least one player reaches the last field of the point-track. The Player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
