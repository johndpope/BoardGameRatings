			<description>No Shame Charades is the unclassy twist to the classic party game. Perfect for social adults with an unfiltered sense of humor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a 2 minute sand timer, 20 Game Changer cards and 480 phrase cards, each with it's own hilarious definition to help the one person that doesn't know what a &amp;quot;Rusty Trombone&amp;quot; is.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Phrases derive from 4 main topic areas: &lt;br/&gt;- today's pop culture(ish) (ex. &amp;quot;Anchorman&amp;quot;, tiger blood, bath salts)&lt;br/&gt;- dark matter (crack baby, kidnap)&lt;br/&gt;- adult stuff (dry hump, walk of shame, morningwood)   &lt;br/&gt;- general funny (brain fart, &amp;quot;sh*t hit the fan&amp;quot;, explosive diarrhea)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 4 types of Game Changer cards - lose a turn, all play, charade with a beverage in one hand, and reverse the timer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team takes 2 minute turns to act out as many phrase cards possible.  For every phrase correctly guessed, your team earns 1 point. If a card is passed, you lose a point.  At the end of each round, the other teams can earn a point by taking 1 correct guess at a card that was passed during the round.  Watch out for Game Changers - these cards will make you wish you\'ve never been born.  First team to 21 wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
