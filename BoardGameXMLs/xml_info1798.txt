			<description>Players start with 1000 life points, and attempt to drain their opponents while staying alive themselves.  Players hit their opponents by rolling combinations of dice that match those on the card (five of a kind: 100) (pair: 10).  First to run out loses.  Other cards affect the number and type of dice rolled, payoffs and other effects on the game.  Game can be played with a 120 card stand alone set or several single cards in addition to starter sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
