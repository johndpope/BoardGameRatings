			<description>Creator Emily Short&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Creator Emily Short (via &lt;a href=&quot;http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=aearuuxv83plclpl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;IFDB&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anglophone Atlantis has been an independent nation since an April day in 1822, when a well-aimed shot from their depluralizing cannon reduced the British colonizing fleet to one ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since then, Atlantis has been the world's greatest center for linguistic manipulation, designing letter inserters, word synthesizers, the diminutive affixer, and a host of other tools for converting one thing to another. Inventors worldwide pay heavily for that technology, which is where a smuggler and industrial espionage agent such as yourself can really clean up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, the Bureau of Orthography has taken a serious interest in your activities lately. Your face has been recorded and your cover is blown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your remaining assets: about eight more hours of a national holiday that's spreading the police thin; the most inconvenient damn disguise you've ever worn in your life; and one full-alphabet letter remover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck getting off the island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
