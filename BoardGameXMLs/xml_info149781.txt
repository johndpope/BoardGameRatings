							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Myth: Slaughterfield Supplement Pack</name>
									
			<description>The Myth: Slaughterfield Supplement Pack contains three separate Slaughterfield Decks. These decks can only be used with the Slaughterfield game mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first deck is a 10 card Random Spawn Generator. This allows you to have a completely random game every time. Each session of Slaughterfield consists of 10 waves of terror. The Heroes task is only to survive as long as they can and take as many of them with you as possible. Traps can be turned against the Darkness, but to separate from the rest of the group is certain death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second deck is a 15 card Slaughterfield Items deck. These items can only be used in Slaughterfield, but every treasure pick-up is guaranteed to be a good one. This deck greatly increases the survivability past Wave 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third deck is a 15 card Slaughterfield Achievement Deck. This deck contains tasks for the Heroes. These tasks are dealt randomly to each player and are kept secret until turned in for a reward or at the end to supplement victory points awarded for kills and waves survived.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
