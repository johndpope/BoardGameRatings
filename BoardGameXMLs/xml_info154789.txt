							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Barbarians of Porphyra</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To be a barbarian is both a personal choice and a cultural one, sometimes given and sometimes thrust upon an individual being. It is an epithet and a badge of pride, for those who live by the indulgence of primal rage see themselves as the pure fighters, not the trained soldiers of wasteful campaigns of old men in comfortable chairs.... The direction and application of barbaric rage and skills is usually based on environment and upbringing, as intertwined as a wizard&amp;rsquo;s books in a quiet tower is to the arcane arts. The isolated lands of Porphyra, especially those in place before The Calling, are the holdfasts of barbaric culture, both human and nonhuman, for &lt;br/&gt;they feel the heart of the beleaguered planet itself, and it might just be Porphrya&amp;rsquo;s rage they are in tune with, after all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barbarians of Porphyra includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New racial archetypes for the barbarian.&lt;br/&gt;     New feats and rage powers.&lt;br/&gt;     An archetype for the runereaper.&lt;br/&gt;     New barbarian hordes and equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
