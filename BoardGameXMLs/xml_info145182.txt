							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nurisel Castle</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nurisel is the second-largest settlement on the island of Melderyn and is the principal seat of the Earl of Nurisel. The settlement has a well-deserved reputation as a center of learning. Earl Sunoril Thabel is an insightful, intelligent man with a reputation for coldness and formality. He is an influential advisor to the King of Melderyn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nurisel Castle article describes the town's history, government, religion, and economics, and provides details for some of the settlement's craftsmen and other locations. Includes full-color GM and player maps as well as complete floor plans for Caer Nurisel, the earl's castle. Plans and full descriptions are also provided for the Save-K'norian seminary and the town mill, which is the headquarters of the local Lia-Kavair (thieves' guild).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a H&amp;acirc;rn Classics article and was originally published in 1987 as part of the Melderyn Kingdom Module. The article has been upgraded with new color artwork and redrawn maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
