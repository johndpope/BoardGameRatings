							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mega Bloks Match and Build</name>
									
			<description>Each player starts with a pawn and a picture of a Mega Bloks creature.  The goal of the game is to collect the blocks needed to build your creature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To do this, you move your pawn around on a board using a spinner.  If you land on a blue space, you can flip it over to reveal a picture of a block.  If it is part of your creature you can collect the block.  If not, return the space face down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players continue spinning and moving around the board revealing spaces and collecting blocks until someone collects all the blocks for their creature.  Other spaces on the board include grey spaces, which do nothing, spin again spaces which let you take another turn, and 'go-anywhere' spaces which let you place your pawn on any space you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
