							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Intermediary Classes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intermediary Class is a new concept for the D20 Modern ruleset. A starting character can choose an Intermediary Class rather than one of the attribute based basic classes, gaining cool abilities without worrying about a Level Adjustment. Intermediary classes are slightly more powerful than basic classes, and slightly weaker than a full advanced class. These unusual classes have special abilities which are balanced by unique defects and weaknesses. Like Templates, intermediary classes straddle the line between risk and reward. Players should think carefully before choosing one of these intermediary classes. This 15 page PDF is an easy-to-integrate PC class and just the sort of thing needed for GMs to add depth to any great d20 Modern campaign world and gaming session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
