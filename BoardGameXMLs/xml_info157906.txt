							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Dretches and Quasits</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And the Meek Shall Inherit the Abyss!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Often considered the lowest of the low, &amp;ldquo;lesser&amp;rdquo; demons like dretches and quasits are rarely afforded the respect and caution due to creatures of the lower planes. Most of the time, this is exactly how the dretches and quasits like it&amp;mdash;after all, if they aren&amp;rsquo;t perceived as a threat, then foolish mortals will summon them, make mistakes, and allow them to sow chaos and discord throughout the material plane. But just because they often play the fool does not mean that these sly and devious demons aren&amp;rsquo;t dangerous adversaries, and when they are infused with mythic power, they can spell the doom of even seasoned adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents game statistics for mythic dretches and mythic quasits, both of which have unique abilities never seen elsewhere. Mythic dretches gain the ability to drain blood&amp;mdash;and mythic power&amp;mdash;from their foes, but must be careful not to drink too much, lest they explode in a shower of gore. Mythic quasits, on the other hand, can tap the power of chaos to harness powerful (albeit, uncontrollable) magic, and can sever small portions of their victims&amp;rsquo; spirits, which they can use to create more quasits. Finally, it introduces rules for performing special rituals that can be enacted by players of any class in order to summon mythic dretches and mythic quasits, with both specific game rules for doing so and detailed flavorful descriptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
