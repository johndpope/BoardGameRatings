							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">You Only Dice Twice</name>
									
			<description>You Only Dice Twice was created for a two-player dice game design competition.  The hardest thing to include in most dice games is some kind of player interaction, so that was a major design goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players race to be the first to close out the most and most valuable number categories.  Each turn, you roll six dice, but you can only use three of them for yourself--you have to let your opponent use the other three!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only things needed to play are six ordinary dice, two pencils, and the provided score sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
