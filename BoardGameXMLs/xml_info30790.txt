							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ant Ranch</name>
									
			<description>(Taken from website)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little Billy got an Ant Ranch for his birthday and sent away for entirely too many ants. You lead one of the unfortunate colonies trying to survive in your new plastic home. To win, you must battle the other ant colonies and survive the many perils, from handing responsibility of the ant ranch over to little brother Johnny (who loves playing with a magnifying glass!), to game's end, when Billy's mom gets fed up with the whole ordeal and throws everything in the trash. Whoever has the most ants when this occurs wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During your turn, you lay tiles to build the tunnel system your colony thrives in, or play special cards to harvest food and water so you can multiply faster than your opponents. Roll the action-packed aphid die and see what your outcome will be! 2-4 players can play Ant Ranch in 2-3 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
