			<description>From Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you ready for a new twist on Jenga? Bring home the classic game of falling bricks coupled with elements from the blockbuster Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen movie. For ages 6 and up, this family game for two or more players allows you to take control of Cybertron-- or family game night-- with your robot-like brick-removal skill. The tiles feature Autobot or Decepticon faction logos and are made from a tasteful, black material. Build and battle with the Transformers Revenge of the Fallen Jenga Battle Game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Divide up into two teams Autobots and Decepticons. The Decepticons go first. Teams alternate turns, rotating so that each player gets chance to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;on you turn, remove one block. Then see if the block shows a symbol:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    if it does not show your TEAM&amp;acute;s symbol, stack the block on top of the tower&lt;br/&gt;    if it shows your TEAM&amp;acute;s symbol, pass it to a player of your choice on the other team. this player must stack the block before the team takes its turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the tower falls over on your team&amp;acute;s turn, your TEAM LOSES. The other TEAM WIN!.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
