			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Issue #51: Mutated Animal/Plant Genotypes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player character wishes to play a mutated animal or plant, he has several choices to make. Animals alone represent a large category but can actually be mammal, reptile, amphibian, avian, or even  insect, and plants are no less diverse. Most animals have different types of advantages and disadvantages &amp;mdash; some are very strong, while others are very agile, some can fly, some breathe water. Plant capabilities and drawbacks can be even more strange and profound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What kind of animal do you want to play? How &amp;ldquo;human&amp;rdquo; do you want your animal character to be? Do you want to be able to use weapons and tools? Do you want to be able to talk? Walk like a human? This expanded issue of Wisdom from the Wastelands answers those questions and guides you through the process of playing a mutated animal or plant character!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
