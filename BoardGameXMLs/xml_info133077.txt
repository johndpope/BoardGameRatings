			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I threaded a sufficient number of loops, trying the length over the edge. Then I said to Elsie, who sat cowering, propped against the crag, &amp;lsquo;You must come and look over, and do as I wave to you. Mind, dear, you must! Two lives depend upon it.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lsquo;Brownie, I daren&amp;rsquo;t? I shall turn giddy and fall over!&amp;rsquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I smoothed her golden hair. &amp;lsquo;Elsie, dear,&amp;rsquo; I said gently, gazing into her blue eyes, &amp;lsquo;you can always be brave, where those you love are concerned; and I believe you love me.&amp;rsquo; I led her, coaxingly, to the edge. &amp;lsquo;Sit there,&amp;rsquo; I said, in my quietest voice, so as not to alarm her. &amp;lsquo;You can lie at full length, if you like, and only just peep over. But when I wave my hand, remember, you must pull the rope up.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She obeyed me like a child. I knew she loved me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;Lois Cayley, Miss Cayley&amp;rsquo;s Adventures, Grant Allen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The luminary is an object of constant attention, and often fame. Through force of personality and the ability to read the strengths and weaknesses of those around her, the luminary can bring out the best in her allies and befuddle and vex her foes. A luminary may seem to be little more than a cheerleader or mascot, but her power to control and alter the morale and inspiration of those around her allows the allies of a luminary to do far more with her than on their own, even if they never realize how crucial her presence is to their success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since a luminary&amp;rsquo;s force of personality is hard to miss, many take roles that suit the constant attention they inevitably attract. The most well-known luminaries are performers and celebrities, but people with the ability to influence and inspire others can be found in many walks of life. A luminary may be a natural born leader, possibly even a military commander, rebel organizer, or rabble-rouser. Some luminaries work behind the scenes, acting as deal-makers, radio news announcers, extremist writers, or salacious pleasure-providing criminals. More rarely a luminary may even use her power of gaining attention work to &amp;ldquo;hide in plain sight,&amp;rdquo; allowing a spymaster to pose as something innocuous, ranging from a rich playgirl to a vapid celebrity famous only for being famous&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this 20 page book are three new archetypes: the celebrity, headliner, and fixer as well as rules expanding the use of the Diplomacy skill to allow characters to influence the attitude of entire groups, be that as small as a gathering on a corner or as large as an entire nation. Finally we touch on the idea of Progress Levels (PL), a simple way to determine the general technological advancement of a campaign (and outlined in more detail in Anachronistic Adventurers: The Enforcer).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
