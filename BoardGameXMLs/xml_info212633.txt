			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Struggling for the Souls of Porphyra- on the Battlefield of Faith!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;For the Twenty and Seven!  For the Called Gods of Porphyra!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fawz al-nar, al-ma&amp;rsquo;an, al-hawa, al-ard! Fawz al-Larba!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;-battle cries during the NewGod Wars&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the Patchwork Planet of Porphyra, your choice of faith and patron being is not just a personal preference, but an allegiance to a cause that exists in the Great Beyond!  Clerics lead the faithful in their quest for a life worth living on Porphyra, be it for peace&amp;hellip; or war!  In Clerics of Porphyra, the new exciting release from Purple Duck Games, you can encounter 12 new cleric archetypes like the single-minded Betrothed, the elementalist Cycle Thrall, the suffering Penitent, and the deadly Right Hand.  Clerics of Porphyra also contains a new domain specific to the Patchwork Planet, the Porphyrite domain, and the subdomains of Borders and Geranite.  And that&amp;rsquo;s not all!  To help your clerics in their holy (or elemental) quests, 16 new feats are included to increase their customizable power, and intriguing new rules such as divine parishes, feat channels and favored musical instruments, for the Gods, Elemental Lords, Slithering Symphony of Chaos, and the enigmatic Ushers of the Psychopomps!  Finally, a new hybrid class is included, the Pillar, which combines the martial might of the mounted marvel, the Cavalier, and the pious power of the Cleric; a sample of one of these intriguing warrior-priests is inside as well!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who shall win in the end, Deist or Elementalist?  Get Clerics of Porphyra from the pious parishioners at Purple Duck Games today and find out- Purple Duck Games, where our games are what you want!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
