			<description>The game is a turn based strategy game with economical macro game phase which includes:&lt;br/&gt; - Politics&lt;br/&gt;- Trade&lt;br/&gt;- Tech development &lt;br/&gt;- Building&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;and Micro game phase with tactical squad based combat which includes:&lt;br/&gt;- Different soldier classes with skills trees&lt;br/&gt;- Custom vehicle &amp;amp; troops loadout &lt;br/&gt;- Deep damage system for vehicles and troops &lt;br/&gt;- Meaningful troops moral and mental statuses&lt;br/&gt;- Weather conditions which influence on stats of vehicles and troops&lt;br/&gt;- Variety of mission types (Vip protection, convoy raids, hostage rescue, search and destroy etc .)&lt;br/&gt;- Permadeath of soldiers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So here is a few words about game setting it's about post world war three, not very distant future with alternative history. World isn't in ruins (it's not a full post apocalypse but pretty messed up) but in a very bad state. Some terytories are in better shape, a rich ones of course live in a good cities with clean air water and ecologically clean food, poor people aren't so lucky they have to deal with desease, poor salaries raiders etc. Political map changed dramaticly some contries disappeared a new one emerged. The name of the game has a relation to the actual document of WWII between Germany and USSR the original text in ussr was kept in the special folder under number 34. The realtion is spiritual of course, it can give the mood of the uncertanty there is peace for now but for how long and at the same time war is continuing but on the different fronts in trade in politics and in actual &amp;quot;undercarpet&amp;quot; secret  combat by mercenary pmc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few words about gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control a group of mercenaries,who  is trying to survive in the world.After choosing a spawn region  players start roam the world map in turn base manner, trading, finding themselves in different random events,building their base and of course taking missions . Countries autonomously  act with each other,influencing the market  and  political situation(some political events can create a job oportunity with bigger challenge  and at the same time with bigger profits and reputation points). As for missions-There are many types of them they are played on a smaller maps with terrain also in the turn based manner(One of the things that we want to make is a very tactical game play where diceroll isn't a decisive thing but human skill is). All in all the game has more  of  rouge like feel  than a  classical wargame with particular objectives.  The process is the main fun part,but global goals also here(Player can get a citizenship of particular country and lead it to world  domination,take hold of the entire PMC market and be the one who pull the strings,also there are  some endings that are closely lore related).Also battle system can be used just for skirmishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
