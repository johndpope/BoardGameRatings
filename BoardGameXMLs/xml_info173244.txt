			<description>You control the destiny of five fearless warriors. You will battle your way through three types of terrain: the damp Darkwoods, the rugged mountains, and the open plains. On your quest you will encounter trolls, deadly Knights and face attacks from every side. It is your mission to advance your satyr through the regions of battle, avoiding the death traps and protecting him at all costs. Because if you're satyr dies, your chance of winning the war dies with him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll dice to move around a track, through different regions of the board, and attack the other player by again rolling dice and comparing to a combat resolution chart to modify the rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
