			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        In the smog and grime of 18th century London, a great evil stirs...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the seedy underclass of the city a plague is taking hold. Its victims are under the sway of something far worse than they can imagine, an entity of disgusting power bent on engulfing the world in disease and death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Investigators are members of the exclusive, but publicly reviled Hell Fire Club. One of the Club&amp;rsquo;s most trusted members is involved in a Breach of Promise suit. But when he vanishes and the woman is found dead, outsiders start to make inquiries; Club secrets could be revealed. If this happens, Club members would be socially ruined. The Investigators must discover the truth of their Brother&amp;rsquo;s disappearance and who - or what - killed his alleged paramour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This trail will take the protagonists into the heart of the disease-ridden underbelly of London society, through a globe-spanning conspiracy and eventually, to the Colonies in a race against time to save the Americas from sharing the same fate as their Brother.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hell Fire is the brand new Trail of Cthulhu scenario from Adam Gauntlett (Not So Quiet). Set in the late 1700s, it harnesses the tense politic situation of the time and infuses it with Mythos horror. A must-have addition to any Keeper&amp;rsquo;s library.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
