			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beau-Jolly made their name in the music business by selling compilations. In the mid 1980s they were looking to do the same thing with video games. One of the companies they approached was Imagine. After their spectacular and public collapse, Beau-Jolly ended up owning Imagine's back-catalogue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Value Pack compilations released by Beau-Jolly contained mostly Imagine games (the Commodore versions also included two Livewire games each). Some games were duplicated across different platforms, but no two compilations were the same, though they shared the same artwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Commodore Vic 20 version consisted of:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wacky Waiters - A platformer where the player needs to negotiate a series of lifts to take drinks to customers.&lt;br/&gt;Arcadia - A Gorf / Galaxians style shoot 'em up.&lt;br/&gt;Catcha Snatcha - You play a store detective chasing after shoplifters and returning lost property.&lt;br/&gt;Bewitched - A disembodied key needs to navigate a maze opening doors while avoiding ghosts and ghouls.&lt;br/&gt;Invaders - A Space Invaders clone.&lt;br/&gt;3D Jumpin Jack - A Frogger clone (despite the name on the packaging, this is not a 3D version of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
