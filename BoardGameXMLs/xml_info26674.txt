			<description>Bellhop is a strategy game where players play as competing shift managers in a hotel. The year is 1939, in New York; the guests in the hotel are leaving for the World's Fair. Each player controls a team of bellhops in the hotel and attempts to earn the most tips by helping the guests off of the elevator and with their luggage as they arrive in the lobby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can backstab your friends' bellhops and reduce his/her tips by stopping their elevator. Be careful, though, as you might not be able to get your guests to the lobby without help! The player who has received the most tips at the end of the game wins. Maximize your points by collecting guests of all types. Try to get a bonus by helping the most guests of any one type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bellhop plays with 2-5 players and lasts between 45 and 60 minutes. The photos are of an unpublished prototype and the designer is actively looking for a publisher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
