							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cut!</name>
									
			<description>The learners are Telecommunications and Film students who have just completed a unit on continuity in films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given a Cut! deck, the learner will be able to distinguish between shots taken from either side of a scene (see Figure 1: The axis of interaction) by sequencing the shots represented on the cards in Cut! without interrupting the continuity of the sequence. Continuity in this game means to stay on one side of the interaction axis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of Cut! is to be the first to discard all your cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;components:&lt;br/&gt;32 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
