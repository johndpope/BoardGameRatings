			<description>This version of baseball was produced in 1941 by Milton Bradley. It is a physical dexterity game that uses a thick cardboard bat about 3.4&amp;quot; long, with a wood semi-circle glued to the underside about 1/3 in from the handle, and with a small hole near the tip of the bat. There are 8 small glass balls, 4 white and 4 black. The cardboard playing field is inset into the box bottom, and is punched with a variety of holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules on the side of the box say that when batting, a player puts the bat about 2&amp;quot; from the home-plate corner of the box, mounts a ball of his color on the hole in the bat, and then brings down his finger with a sharp blow to the bat handle. This launches the ball up and onto the playing field. Falling into one of four large oblong holes around the pitcher's mound is a strike. Dropping into the round hole near each fielder  is an out. Dropping into any of the numbered holes is a safe hit of that many bases. There is a home run hole in deep center field. If a launched ball fails to fall into any of the holes, it is a ball. Three strikes cause an out, while four balls of course generate a walk. Successful hits are marked by putting balls into holes on the appropriate bases before batting again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be found listed in &amp;quot;Baseball Games from Antique Baseball to Modern Baseball Sims&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
