			<description>Taking the role of Sir Cucumber, a knight, the player is assigned by King Broccoli (now deceased) to defeat the evil Minister Pumpkin who has kidnapped Princess Tomato. The plot is fairly complex by 8-bit console gaming standards. Early on, Sir Cucumber gains a sidekick, Percy the baby persimmon, who offers advice and helps throughout the quest (and always calls Sir Cucumber &amp;quot;Boss&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom plays similarly to a text adventure, though due to the NES's lack of a keyboard accessory, the possible commands are represented by buttons which line both sides of the screen. The commands are fixed and do not change during gameplay. Primarily, the game consists of still screens with the exception of the &amp;quot;finger wars&amp;quot;, mazes and occasional animated character, such as the octoberry and fern birds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
