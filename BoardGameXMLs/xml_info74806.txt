			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter is a video game for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Released before Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones opened in theatres, it is the sequel to Star Wars: Starfighter. Jedi Starfighter takes place just prior to the second Star Wars film's events and during the Battle of Geonosis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the player controls different star fighters from the Star Wars Universe. Each mission revolves around protecting friendly ships and destroying enemy ships. Each mission also has one bonus and one hidden objective completing of which unlocks bonus missions, videos, and starfighters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starfighters are equipped with different weaponry which can be highly effective in certain missions. The use of the force weapons in the Jedi Starfighter present a unique aspect to the genre. Force weapons are activated by holding a button which begins to turn the screen purple, and releasing it before the screen becomes white. Holding the button for just the right amount of time will cause the force weapon to last longer or destroy more targets. Holding it too long or too short will reduce its effectiveness. Although unlimited in number, force weapons take several seconds to &amp;quot;recharge&amp;quot; while Adi is regaining her mental strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
