			<description>&amp;quot;This game simulates the growth of ancient empires. Each player leads a young empire and controls its growth through its development. The units used to represent people are populations and monetary units are measured in gold points.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Use a piece of hex paper and color equal numbers of squares green for grassland and yellow for desert. Each player chooses a starting grassland hex and puts a city and 3 population points on that hex. No two starting hexes may be closer than three hexes from each other.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players build their empires by constructing cities, roads, temples, walls, marketplaces, and libraries. There are also three types of military forces available to attack opposing empires: Soldiers, Swordsmen, and Horsemen. The game also covers concepts such as disasters, technological advances, taxes, and population migration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Victory occurs when, at the end of his turn, a player has 20 victory points or has destroyed or captured all enemy cities, armies and populations.&amp;quot; Victory Points are scored for cities, temples, and technological advances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
