							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Everest Explorer</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's Catalog&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Towering above the clouds, the summit of Mount Everest is a forbidding spot. Only a handful of daring adventurers have made it to this five-mile-high pinnacle where the air is thin, violent storms erupt with little warning, and danger lurks at every footfall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EVEREST EXPLORER lets you challenge the world's highest mountain without ever leaving home. This logistical simulation goes beyond most adventures, forcing you to make all the life-or-death decisions required at every step of the attempt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assigned an expedition budget, you must select the manpower, food, fuel, shelter and oxygen supplies you will need to support your quest. Now the adventure begins as you manipulate your resources to outwit the elements and terrain, establishing ever higher encampments. Weather, route, season, climbers' condition and morale all play key roles in the final question: will you reach Everest's 29,028 foot summit--and return to tell about it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
