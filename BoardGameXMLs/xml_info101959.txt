							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Diner</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob stared out the window, watching the pellets of rain beat itself against the sidewalk. Heaven's tears beat a complex rhythm with the diner's rattling air conditional, but neither could drown out Lashauna sobbing at the other end of the counter. The waitress dug the meager cash from the register while a nervous thug pointed a pistol at her ample torso. Jacob cursed under his breath and considered doing nothing, until the thug turned his attention to the diner's half-dozen customers. A kidnapping, two assassination attempts, and now this. He slowly slid the pistol from its concealed-carry holster and allowed himself a moment of self-pity. It just wasn't his day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where do you go from here? To the battle map, of course! If you need a map of a modern structure, you need Modern Floorplans. The Modern Floorplans series from Fabled Environments and 12 to Midnight offers gamers high quality maps in a variety of configurations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Want to draw it out yourself? Use the 8.5&amp;times;11 map as a guide.&lt;br/&gt;     Want to simply drop the map on the table and play? Use either the 24&amp;times;36 full map (if you have access to a plotter printer) or print the tiled version on regular paper and assemble a full-size version yourself in a matter of minutes. Both versions are scaled at 1 inch equals 5 feet.&lt;br/&gt;     In addition, each floorplan also comes in versions without room labels and without furniture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: All floorplans are rendered in black and white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All maps are created by an architectural drafter using AutoCAD. This gives all of the maps the realistic feel that your players crave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Average Diner&lt;br/&gt;This floorplan can be used as either a simple diner, coffee house, or donut shop. The floorplan includes spaces for counter seating, booths, a kitchen area, storage, and more. Use this floorplan as a public place for the heroes to meet their shadowy informant, a random encounter like a robbery, or an ingenious &amp;quot;front&amp;quot; for a secret underground spy headquarters. The uses are limited only by your imagination!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The maps in this title can also be found in Modern Floorplans Volume 2: Goin' Out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
