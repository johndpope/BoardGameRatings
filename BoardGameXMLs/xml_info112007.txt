			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Nobody goes into Black Forest willingly. Only those that's taken, and they don't be returning.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;- Old Borderlands Saying&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story is simple: Fort Vanguard, a small but sturdy fortification, stands on the very border of Black Forest. The lord of the Fort, Commander Voorhess, has a beautiful daughter named Kara, who was captured by Caled raiders three nights ago while on her way to visit her father. Her retinue of three soldiers and a slave girl were also captured. The raiders took their captives back into Black Forest, beyond the Godaxe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being short of men, Commander Voorhess has ordered you, the Border Wolves, to pursue the raiders and rescue his daughter. You know the truth: you have been chosen because any other man in the small garrison would have refused such a dangerous mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Forest is dark and silent and, although you constantly feel you are being watched, nothing hinders your advance. After pursuing them for two days, you have now located the raiders in a small Caled village...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want to know how it ends, download and run the Halloween GRAmel`s one sheet for Beasts and Barbarians - Wolves in the Borderland!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
