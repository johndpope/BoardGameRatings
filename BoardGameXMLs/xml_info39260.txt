							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Personnages Historiques a Reconstituer</name>
									
			<description>This French-language educational game consists of 16 sets of 3 tiles each depicting important French leaders from Vercingetorix to Napoleon III.  Each set of tiles displays the head (plus name and birth and death dates), torso, and legs of the leader in question.  All three cards are marked with the same identifying number (1-16).  The game also comes with a 4-page biographical survey of the depicted leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the under-6's, the game is simply one of putting the tiles together to form the leaders.  In the solitaire version, the child attempts to correctly construct all 16 figures. In the two-player version, children flip tiles one at a time by turn, trying to build the leaders.  The child with the most complete leaders wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game for 6-and-overs plays with a simple Go-Fish mechanic where 2-3 players take turns trying to reconstruct the famous leaders of French history by asking each other for specific body parts and pulling from the draw pile if they don't get them.  Again, the winner is the player who has reconstituted the most historical personages before the draw pile is gone and someone has run out of tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
