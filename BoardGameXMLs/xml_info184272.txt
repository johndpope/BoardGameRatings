							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SWODES: Star Wars One-Dice Epic System</name>
									
			<description>SWODES: Star Wars One-Dice Epic System, seeks to simplify the mechanics presented in West End Games' Star Wars RPG by replacing the core d6 mechanic with a single d10 roll.  The game itself is heavily reliant on the West End Games product, referring most character creation rules, statistics, and skills to that product.  A rule for converting West End Games' Star Wars characters' d6 dice pools to SWODES skill modifiers is presented.  Aside from this core replacement, there is little original material in this rule set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character skills in SWODES are represented by a single number (-1 to 48), which is the target number that must be rolled under for success.  Note the d10 roll is scored zero through nine (not one through ten).  The die roll has situational modifiers applied by GM fiat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A final comment gives hints on how standard adventures, settings, and other products can be adapted to SWODES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
