							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">New Horizon Starter Guide</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a short summary of the New Horizon Role Playing Game Compendium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The New Horizon Starter Guide contains everything you need to know if you want to create characters for the New Horizon setting and create your own New Horizon adventures for these characters. The book is intended to be used as a role-playing game (RPG) guide for New Horizon games in which participants assume the roles of New Horizon characters. As long as it is within the rules, players have the freedom to select different actions of their characters in order to shape the direction and outcome of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the players is expected to assume the role of a game master (GM). The GM creates a setting in which each player plays the role of a single character. The GM describes the game world and its inhabitants while the other players describe the intended actions of their characters. Based on this information, the GM describes the outcome of each action. Some outcomes are determined by the rule system, and some are chosen by the GM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Horizon is a table top RPG. While the D20 tabletop system is the most popular, New Horizon uses an exciting new rule system called Vo|t. For this new rule system you only need two D20 dice, preferably one white and one black.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
