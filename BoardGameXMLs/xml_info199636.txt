			<description>How well do you really know your friends? Find out in the ultimate party game of opinions... Classified!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, one player is assigned a number 1-11, but isn't told what it is. Then, the rest of the group has to try to get that player to guess what the number is by giving a clue based on a shared prompt -- for example, &amp;quot;the beverage you drink on a hot day&amp;quot; -- in the &amp;quot;manner&amp;quot; of the number, where 1 is the worst, and 11 is the best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, if it were a 1, one might say, &amp;quot;warm cobra venom.&amp;quot; An good clue for 11 might be, &amp;quot;a smoothie made from fruits found in the Garden of Eden.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the guessed gets it right, they get to keep the card. If they're wrong, they award the card to whomever they feel gave them the best clue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First person to five cards wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
