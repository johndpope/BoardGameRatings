			<description>Object of the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game goal is to pass all four grades and get to college first!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1/ The object of the game is to get to &amp;quot;college&amp;quot; first with a&lt;br/&gt;report card from each of the four English catagories from each&lt;br/&gt;grade 9-12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2/ Players can earn a report card by successfully answering a&lt;br/&gt;question from that catagory after landing on the corresponding space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3/ Players can move backwards or forward, but must move the total&lt;br/&gt;amount of spaces rolled on the die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4/ If a player gets a question correct, he or she may continue with&lt;br/&gt;another roll or more until he or she gets an answer incorrect or&lt;br/&gt;lands in detention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5/ If sent to detention, a player looses a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6/ After a player rolls out of detention, he or she can reenter anywhere in that grade level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7/ A player may, at any time, forfeit a turn to go to summer school&lt;br/&gt;in lieu of trying to pass a English catagory. In summer&lt;br/&gt;school, the player has the freedom to choose the English catagory&lt;br/&gt;that the question comes from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8/A player may only go to summer school to make up for one subject for each grade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9/In order to pass a grade, the player does not have to &amp;quot;land&amp;quot; on the finals space. Instead, the player can simply turn in 4 earned report cards to pass onto summer vacation and the next grade as he or she passes the finals space. In other words, a player cannot pass a grade level until he or she has earned three report cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10/ If a player lands on an office card, an office card is drawn and&lt;br/&gt;directions are to be followed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;11/ If a player lands on a library card, a library card is drawn&lt;br/&gt;and directions are to be followed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;12/ If a player get an answer incorrect, the player to the left may&lt;br/&gt;at anytime &amp;quot;steal&amp;quot; the question and potentially earn that report card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;13/ A peek pass may turn a question into multiple choice at any time. Each player has two peek passes at the start of the game. After the peek pass is used, the player must hand in that pass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;14/ When a player answers a question correctly, he or she keeps that card as their report card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
