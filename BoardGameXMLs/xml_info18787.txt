			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HunkerDown&amp;copy; is a fun fast paced board game designed to take 2-6 players through a full hurricane season. Each turn is filled with the opportunity to prepare, or HunkerDown&amp;copy; for the approaching hurricane. BEWARE&amp;hellip; before the hurricane always comes a feeder band, which can impose on you a series of outrageous events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The good news is&amp;hellip; after every hurricane there is relief that will offer aid while trying to deal with the aftermath of the storm. The player that survives the season first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
