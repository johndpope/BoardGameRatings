			<description>SCRAMBLED HEADS! - The Crazy Clues Game! is a similar game to HEADBANZ and others of that ilk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take it in turns to be the 'Head Case' by placing a headpiece on their head. A card is placed in the headpiece by another player such that it can be seen by all the players except the one actually wearing the headpiece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game card shows three subjects in three different categories - Food and Drink, Entertainment and Miscellaneous.  The subject is something that should be familiar to all the players and could be anything from a famous film star to a wild animal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 'Head Case' selects whether he wishes clues on the category on the top, middle or bottom row of his card, and is then informed of which particular category the subject belongs to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other players then take it in turns to offer clues as to what the subject is.  Clues should be relevant to the subject but somewhat distant and slightly cryptic.  Clues should not be derived from part of the subject title.  The 'Head Case' has 10 seconds to try and guess the text on the card at which point the next player gives another clue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tokens are added into a central pile to indicate how many clues have been given - these tokens having been evenly distributed amongst the players at the start of the game. If the 'Head Case' guesses the subject then the player that gave the last clue must collect all the tokens.  A player also gains them if he is unable to provide a suitable clue.  In the event of the 'Head Case' not guessing the answer within 12 clues he fails and collects all the tokens from the pile,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another player is then selected as the 'Head Case' and the while process is repeated.  Play continues until one of the players runs out of tokens or when all players agree to stop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
