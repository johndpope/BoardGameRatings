							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Halls of Horror: Gothic Floor Plans</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the surface it seemed like a perfectly ordinary mansion. I drove up the sweeping gravel driveway, looking forward to a relaxing weekend of bridge and grouse-shooting, as the Professor's invitation had promised. Little did I know what awaited me in the Halls of Horror...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Halls of Horror is a complete set of gothic room plans suitable for use in horror and fantasy roleplaying games, allowing you to visualise your scenes of unnameable horror instantly and in mind-blasting detail. The 12 sheets of full-colour A4 card include thirteen complete rooms, plus two sheets of furniture and grisly accessories which can be used to set the scene in almost any period up to the present day. Simply separate the room plans, cut out the accessories, and the set is ready to use. Coloring the edges of the accessoriy counters will make them merge well with the backgound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User additions:&lt;br/&gt;Not published for any specific RPG but obviously aimed at CoC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
