							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fall of Whitecliff</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awakening in the dark with splitting headache, you hear the curses of other tight-packed prisoners. No screaming. Must not be in the deep dungeons, not yet. Damned castellan - he&amp;rsquo;s as paranoid as he is venial. Apparently his keep is hard to crack even when he&amp;rsquo;s gone. But you&amp;rsquo;re inside now. He'll regret this, if you can slip out of this cage...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fall of Whitecliff is a sandbox/regional adventure written for a new group of players, designed to take them from nothing-but-the-clothes-on-their-back fresh level 1s all the way up to level 4 by the end of the adventure. The adventure takes place within a small and mountainous region along the coast that can be placed almost anywhere in your campaign world of choice, and can be readily adapted to most common fantasy RPG systems. It uses the one-page dungeon format to deliver tight, punchy sessions focused entirely for the game master's use at the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 1st - 4th level adventurers.  Includes conversion notes for use with 5th Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
