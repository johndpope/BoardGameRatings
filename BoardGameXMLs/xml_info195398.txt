			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game exist in three distinct time and dimension locations and, during phased play, travel between them.  These three settings are defined.  Characters have a separate &amp;quot;avatar&amp;quot; in each locale.  The avatar is the character component that interacts with the game world.  Avatars inherit some base abilities and attributes from the character and also gain time-and-space appropriate Skills.  The game's premise is that character actions in time influence other times; and that character actions in place influence other places.  Action resolution uses a d4, sometimes leading to a series of d4 rolls, with often complicated outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
