							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">League Leader Rugby</name>
									
			<description>This boardgame has all the familiar aspects of rugby including rules, terminology, tactics, and of course, excitement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players play their games against the board. A single game is played by traveling from the kick-off square to the final whistle square. Tries/conversions are scored during each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Essentially, the board creates realistic results that players record on a league table. Each player has their own league table for recording results. When each players league table has been completed, the player with the most league points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
