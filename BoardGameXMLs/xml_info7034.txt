			<description>&amp;quot;These rules are designed to give the players the feel of air-to-air combat in the early years of World War II. All the basic maneuvers used in fighter combat are included, and such variables as pilot experience and aircraft maneuverability and firepower are also taken into account . . . An ideal game would begin with 6 to 8 players.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fighter Pilot was a set of World War II air combat rules for miniatures originally published by The Little Soldier in 1976. This &amp;quot;Deluxe&amp;quot; set converted the rules to a boardgame format and added some additional rules. Each hex is 100 feet across and each turn is approximately 1 second. Counters represent individual aircraft. The game includes 25 American, British, German, and Japanese fighters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
