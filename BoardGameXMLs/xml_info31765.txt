			<description>In Party Time the players play in two teams. One player draws a card and has to explain/describe, draw, pantomime or knead up to three words/items. Depending on how many items his/her team guesses the team's pawn may advance 0, 1, 3 or 6 steps along the board. On the cards you have clusters of three terms per action to be taken. The action a player has to take (explain, draw, pantomime or knead) is decided on the field the pawn is situated on.&lt;br/&gt;You also have a flash symbol on the board. Whenever a pawn starts its move on the flash symbol, this goup must take an special card and one player has to do whatever is written on the card (e.g. &amp;quot;non-sense&amp;quot; like explain terms using a certain slang, stand and one leg and put off your shoes and socks, keep your breath for 90 seconds...).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game No. 71245.0 from F.X. Schmid, published 1994 (1993 ParaDice)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
