			<description>This game is a sort of shooting gallery for at home in a ferris wheel theme. Your target is to shoot sensors with a sort of laser-gun. When you hit the sensor with the laser a balloon pops. This game can be played alone as well as with several players (using time targets for example).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It came in a lot of different variants, all in the State Fair style (see other names). Also a lot of other target shooting games exists nothing to do with those of this brand, but they may be listed here as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
