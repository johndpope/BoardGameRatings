			<description>A game where a player tries to get the wooden mouse as fast as possible to its destination in the food chips, while another player tries to solve the dexterity game. If the player gets the food before, he gets to keep it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fritz der M&amp;auml;useblitz is a game for children 6 to 12. There is a board with squares between the mouse hole and the pantry. Each round, a player plays the mouse and his/her left neighbor tries simultaneously to catch the mouse. After each turn, roles turn clockwise. The player with the mouse rolls a D6 die and moves the mouse from the hole to the pantry and back to get food. Simultaneously, the other player tries to put 2 mouses in 2 traps in a tiny dexterity game. If he succeeds before the mouse reaches the pantry, he gets 2 food cards (with a number value on it), if he succeeds while the mouse in on its way back to the hole, both players get a food card, and if the mouse reaches the hole, the &amp;quot;mouse player&amp;quot; gets 2 food cards. The winner is the player with the highest total on his/her food cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
