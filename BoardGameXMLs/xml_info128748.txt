							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Doom Comes to Dustpawn</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invaders From Space!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the iron mines that made Dustpawn so prosperous played out not long after the Goblinblood Wars of Isger ended, the city shifted its focus from mining to goat herding with quite a bit of success. Things have, as a result, been quiet and calm in Dustpawn for the past several years, but that quiet is shattered the night a strange falling star roars across the sky above town to crash somewhere in the hills several miles to the south. When several locals eager to find the fallen star and strip it of its ore go missing, it becomes apparent that whatever has fallen from the sky is much more than a mere meteorite. There are those in town who claim the falling star was in fact a ship, and now a strange malady is creeping through the townsfolk. Can the PCs discover the truth behind the falling star before doom comes to Dustpawn?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by Mike Welham, the 2012 winner of Paizo Publishing&amp;rsquo;s annual RPG Superstar contest&amp;mdash;in which unpublished authors compete before a panel of celebrity game designers and legions of their peers for the chance to write a Pathfinder Module&amp;mdash;Doom Comes to Dustpawn presents the players with a classic trope of 1950s sci-fi recast in the fantasy setting of the world of Golarion. Can the PCs save the town of Dustpawn from a menace from the darkest depths of space?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doom Comes to Dustpawn is an adventure of investigation and cosmic horror for 9th-level characters, written for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and compatible with the 3.5 edition of the world&amp;rsquo;s oldest RPG. This volume also contains a gazetteer of the town of Dustpawn and a brand-new monster template for a strange form of feral mutation, both of which can easily be integrated into any campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
