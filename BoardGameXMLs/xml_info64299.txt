			<description>Spazzz!!!! Nature Is a unique card game that requires skillful hand gestures and quick timing to win. The goal is to be the first one to get rid of all your cards. Players take turn playing cards, when matching cards are played each player has to preform a crazy motion determined by the cards causing a flurry of crazy spazy reactions because the slowest person has to take the pile of played cards. Every game ends up being crazy and hilarious. Enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
