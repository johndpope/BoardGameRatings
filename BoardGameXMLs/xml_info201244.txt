			<description>The expansion takes the form of 20 unique cards, five of which are revealed at the start of the game. The cards, which represent different  effects, can be used once only per game, by anyone at the table, as an action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards represent everything from devious sabotage to risky trade-offs. Once revealed, they're akin to a loaded revolver in the middle of the game table: whether you want to use them to level the playing field, or utilise them as a bargaining tool should you think someone is bluffing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think somebody escaped with too many juicy profits? Bring them back in with a Bailout. Want to expose someone's workforce? Employ some Hackers. Think someone is too close to Downsizing? Surprise them with some friendly Interns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Market Movements is a simple addition that gives you so many possibilities for different avenues of game play. Whether you want a grudge match with a rival or a more interesting game with a group of friends, we hope this will add a great deal more playability to the core game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
