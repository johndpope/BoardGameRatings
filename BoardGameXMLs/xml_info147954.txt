							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stage of the Gods</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 48 x 30 inch, full color floorplan of a mountain stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It comes with Square, Hex and No Ovelays and includes the VTT files for online use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Gods favor can only be won by scaling the mountain. Those who succeed gain the knowledge or item they seek.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stage of the Gods is a single large map of a Greek gladiatorial arena cut into the zenith of a mountain. The mountain plateau towers above the clouds and gives a close-up view of the moon. The Stage of the Gods includes a 360-degree panoramic view from the center of the arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stage of the Gods is intended for use in fantasy games, specifically making an excellent location for interaction between the pantheon of Greek deities and heroes needing to be tested atop Mount Olympus. However, this lofty location also makes for an excellent backdrop for interaction with gods of any setting, including those that mix fantasy and science fiction. Finally it could be used in a martial arts game where a mystical arena is needed for a fighting tournament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stage of the Gods is intended as a location for a great trial for the heroes. They begin at the nadir of the mountain and must journey up the paths circling the mountain base. When the paths end, they must begin climbing the cliff face and get to the summit. Along the way the heroes may need to fight beasts that live on the mountain or defeat other adventurers competing for an audience with the gods. When they reach the top, the gods refuse to meet the heroes unless they defeat a champion in a gladiatorial battle. The champion is extremely strong and attempts to use his great strength to toss the hero or demigod off the mountain. If the heroes defeat the champion, they may ask the gods a question or receive a reward item needed to complete an epic quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
