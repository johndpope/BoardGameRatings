			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was officially cancelled or abandoned and is no longer in development. An unfinished version(s) of it may or may not have been made available to the public at some point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place hundreds of years before the events of the Mistborn trilogy, during the early years of the Final Empire. The player will play as the arrogant young nobleman Fendin &amp;quot;Fiddle&amp;quot; Fathvell, a Mistborn. He must quickly master his newfound Allomantic abilities before forces at work can destroy his entire family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birthright appears to have had a troubled development cycle and a hard time getting off the ground. After losing half their internal development team in 2012, Little Orbit attempted to source other developers to keep the project afloat. After finally finding a developer in 2015, the company's retail distributors went under nearly taking Little Orbit into bankruptcy, and it was eventually decided that the company could no longer work on a project of that scale, and has to concede the rights to the license. Mistborn: Birthright was cancelled because of funding problems for developer Little Orbit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mistborn: Birthright,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
