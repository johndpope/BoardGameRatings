			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the mouldering, crudely scanned pages of this makeshift tome is revealed the veritable Dead Sea Scrolls of the AD&amp;amp;D game. Okay, maybe that's laying it on a little thick, but this wouldn't be an orange-spined 1st Edition book without a little hyperbole on the back! So, ahem, prepare your mind for a phantasmagorical feast that will sustain its imaginings for eons to come. Like an infinite sheet pizza! With breadsticks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Title Page:&lt;br/&gt;A COMPENDIUM OF OFFICIAL STRATEGIC REVIEW AND DRAGON MAGAZINE RULES UPDATES FOR THE AD&amp;amp;D&amp;trade; GAME. TOTALING THE LENGTH OF THE PLAYER&amp;rsquo;S HANDBOOK PLUS DUNGEON MASTER&amp;rsquo;S GUIDE, THIS WORK COMMENTS ON, EXPANDS, AND ILLUMINATES THE AD&amp;amp;D&amp;trade; SYSTEM. EVERY ARTICLE THAT DESCRIBES WHAT IS OFFICIAL IN DRAGON, OR STATES THAT IT IS OFFICIAL, OR THAT WAS SCRIBED BY GARY GYGAX APPEARS HEREIN. UNEARTHED ARCANA IS OBSOLETE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Description:&lt;br/&gt;This fan-compiled book gathers all of the articles published in the early TSR magazines, Strategic Review and Dragon Magazine, written by Gygax, Kuntz, Moore, Mentzer, and Lakofka. It was briefly posted on LULU as a POD product printed at cost in 2015, but was removed after only 2 months.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
