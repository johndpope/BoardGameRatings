							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trench War: A Solitaire Game of Tactical Combat in the Trenches of the First World War.</name>
									
			<description>INTRODUCTION: Trench War is a solitaire game of Combat in the muddy trenches in France or Belgium during World War I. The player assumes the role of a commander of an Infantry Platoon during its grueling and miserable turn in the Trenches before they are relieved. As the Platoon Leader, you are responsible for securing your Sector of Front by successfully taking enemy positions and defending yours with the least amount of casualties. Although there are many support units available to you, they may often times be limited to you by political, logistical or geographical obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OBJECTIVE: The objective of Trench War is to successfully survive a Tour in the trenches along the Western Front during World War I. A Tour consists of a number of Rotations in the Trenches. The Player can play a Short Tour (1 Rotation), an Average Tour (2 Rotations) or a Long Tour (3 Rotations). Each Rotation consists of making a Rotation Deck of 20 &amp;ldquo;Trench War&amp;rdquo; Cards and once all Trench War Cards have been drawn and resolved, the Rotation is over and the Player totals his Rotation VP and adds it to his Tour VP. Once all Rotations have been completed, the Player totals his Tour VP and then compares it to the Victory Determination Table to determine the level of success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME FEATURES: Trench War features plenty of colorful Game Counters, Map and Battle Mat, used for resolving Combat. The Game provides plenty of grim themes associated with the War in the Trenches. Counters include Infantry Soldiers, HMGs, Flamethrowers, MK-IV Tanks, A7 Tanks, FT-17 Tanks, Pillboxes, Aircraft, Sub-Machineguns and Light Machineguns.&lt;br/&gt;If you enjoy movies like &amp;quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Lost Batallion&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Sergeant York&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Westfront 1917&amp;quot; or World War One in general, you will enjoy this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
