			<description>Passaportas, The Board Game takes players back to the 1950's, a time in which air travel was still stood for exceptional adventures. As a travel agent, players will try to bring their own groups of passengers (1, 2, 3 and 4 travellers) from to their respective departure cities to their destinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board shows the world map with all departure/arrival cities, the different connections between them with their fuel cost, the chartered airplane with ten available seats, a fuel indicator and a customs area. Each player is randomly dealt a departure and destination card for each of their four traveller groups and also receives a number of customs cards. The plane is placed on a randomly chosen starting location. If this happens to be the departure location for any of the players' passengers, these may immediately board the plane and all is clear for take-off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A players' turn consists of the following actions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     First, two six-sided dice are rolled and the result is added to the fuel indicator. After that, the player may move the plane using one or more connections, as far as the fuel reserve will allow. &lt;br/&gt;     If the plane lands at the destination airport for any of the passengers that are on the plane, these are moved to the customs area. When enough seats are available in the plane, new passengers may board the plane at the current location.&lt;br/&gt;     Players may now play matching customs cards for the current location, thereby sending passengers from the customs area and/or the plane back home. Any passengers that are still in the customs area after this phase have successfully completed the trip and count towards victory.&lt;br/&gt;     If previously unavailable seats have opened up during the customs phase, the remaining passengers departing from the current airport may board the plane now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play then passes clockwise and continuous until all passengers from a player have made for to their destinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
