							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Things in the Forest</name>
									
			<description>From the front cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Barbarian Lord and his army emerged from the Darken Wood and swarmed across the land. Eventually his army failed and the greed-driven lord retreated back to the wild lands of the north. He was never seen again. Many years later, a dark and horrific creature fell upon a peaceful valley many miles from the Darken Wood. Through the mystery of fate, these two events are directly linked. Now is the time to find and destroy The Things in the Forest!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Things in the Forest is an adventure for four to six characters of 4th to 6th level. This module requires the use of the First Edition game rules. Designed as a sequel to T1 The Thing in the Valley, playing that module is not required, though recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
