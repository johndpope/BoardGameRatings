							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">High Valor</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Valor is a fantasy RPG set in its own world where the Free Kingdoms struggle to leave their Dark Ages behind just as their deepest fears are realized. The enemies of mankind, demonic Fane-Lords who once enslaved man, have destroyed the Black Gate that held them in their own lands. Now all of the races of man: Dvegr, Humans, Sidda, Sidhain, and Fane-created Fomoradgh must stand together or fall before them and become their slaves once again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Valor takes fantasy gaming along familiar paths but trods in different boots. Glory in battle and die for your cause. Face down evil and kindle a light in the onrushing dark. Brutal battles come. You with your allies may be all that can shift the tide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rhyme your spell words and sing songs of magic; humble yourself before the High Lord and in the Martyr's name to gird your people against monsters; take the sword and fight.  Rely on will, faith and valor as you risk damnation, death, and terrible ends for the needs of others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is your choice. Now, what will it be?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Valor uses a custom system based around FEAT pools. Small dice pools of Will, Faith, and Valor are drawn upon to add game results to traits you describe yourself or draw traits from the many examples provided. Make your choices matter. Make these traits what you want them to represent and leap into the dangerous world of Aeia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
