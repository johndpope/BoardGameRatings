							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Frontier</name>
									
			<description>Space Frontier is a game of space exploration for 2-4 players. Players compete to spread their influence across a region of uncharted space.  The game takes roughly an hour to an hour and a half to play with 2 players with each additional player adding about a half hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls a command ship and its supporting fleets. The command ship is a mobile factory, research lab, and ship carrier. Players will use it to construct the fleets that help spread their influence far and wide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The modular space map is built from randomized tiles each game as players explore. The random map generation ensures no two games of Space Frontier are exactly the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players gain influence through missions, research, trade, or conquest. Players can be as cooperative or antagonistic with each other as they wish. Thus, games can be played and won where military might reigns supreme, or without a shot being fired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
