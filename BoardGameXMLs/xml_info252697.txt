							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sleepy Hollow</name>
									
			<description>In the town of Sleepy Hollow, Katrina Van Tassel, daughter of wealthy landowner Baltus Van Tassel, has two suitors vying for her hand in marriage: Brohm Van Brunt, a local burly townsman looking to improve his livelihood, and Ichabod Crane, a refined outsider whose intellect is rivaled only by his penchant for belief in the supernatural. Curiously, the inception of this love triangle also marks the genesis of much paranormal activity in Sleepy Hollow. Tales of a mysterious &amp;quot;Headless Horseman&amp;quot; have rattled the community, and the whispers imply that he seeks to head off any engagement to Katrina,,, literally. The object of the game is to successfully marry Katrina to one of her suitors, or to thwart the impending marriage by reuniting the Horseman to his Head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle cards and deal 2-4 players one card each. After each turn player keeps only 1 card in-hand. During a turn, player draws a card and does one of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Makes no play and discards one of their two cards face-down in the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plays a Character Card by placing it in front of them. (Players are only allowed 2 Character Cards in front of them unless they have an Innkeeper played, see Special Situations.*)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plays a Townsfolk Card by reading it aloud and following the instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player wins the round when they have Katrina and either Brom or Ichabod played in front of them, and the minister card is played (barring the subsequent play of the Bishop). Alternately, any player who holds both the Head and the Horseman in their hand may play them at any time for an instant win (barring the subsequent play of the Blacksmith). First Player to win 2 rounds wins Sleepy Hollow!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
