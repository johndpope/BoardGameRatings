			<description>Driving Emotion Type-S (ドライビング・エモーション・タイプエス) was Square's first release for the PlayStation 2 console. After criticisms of the game's handling, the European and North American versions of the game feature revised controls and gave additional content.  The game features officially licensed cars from international manufacturers. Several modes of playing are present, including a training mode and a two-player mode. The game's music, primarily composed by Shinji Hosoe, was published as a soundtrack in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay of Driving Emotion Type-S follows general conventions of racing games. The game's physics and controls intend to be realistic and are based on vehicular weight. The player competes in races with other computer controlled cars in order to unlock new cars and tracks. Car settings can be customized, as well as their colors, before each course. The game includes 43 officially licensed cars from twelve Japanese and European manufacturers, including BMW, Toyota, Nissan, Ferrari, Porsche, and Mazda. Fourteen courses are available in total, including real and fictional ones, and one exclusive to the Western versions of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four game modes. The &amp;quot;Arcade Type-S&amp;quot; mode is the main part of the game, and allows the play to immediately join a race. Only four cars are available at the beginning of the game, but as the player wins more races, more cars and tracks are unlocked. The &amp;quot;Line Training&amp;quot; mode enables the player to try out any of the tracks and improve their driving techniques, without any computer-controlled car. An ideal racing line is shown in red on the track and becomes jagged when the suggested braking points are approached. This mode features four autocross tracks that do not feature in the other modes. A &amp;quot;Time Attack&amp;quot; and split-screen two-player &amp;quot;Vs Mode&amp;quot; fill out the gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Driving Emotion Type-S&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
