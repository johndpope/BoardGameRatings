							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sanxion</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sanxion was Thalamus' first game for the C64, designed and programmed by Stavros Fasoulas, a Finnish independent programmer. It is a horisontal scrolling shooter that was for its time very quick. The lower part (about 2/3rds) of the game screen consists of a sideview while the smaller upper part showed a top down view. The bar separating the two views contains the game info like score and number of lives left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The music, both the loading music and the title music, was composed by Rob Hubbard. The title music was a version of Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was converted to the ZX Spectrum in 1989.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;Stavros Fasoulas: Design, programming&lt;br/&gt;Rob Hubbard: Music&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
