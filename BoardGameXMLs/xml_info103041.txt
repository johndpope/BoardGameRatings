			<description>Ms. Splosion Man is an action platform video game developed by Twisted Pixel Games, and was released on Xbox 360 on July 13, 2011. It is the sequel to 2009's 'Splosion Man. The game takes place directly after 'Splosion Man. In the celebration of 'Splosion Man's capture the scientists accidentally create Ms. Splosion Man. The gameplay draws most of its core elements from its predecessor, but adds new gameplay mechanics such as jump pads and riding on rails.&lt;br/&gt;The game is set immediately following 'Splosion Man. The character 'Splosion Man is finally captured by Big Science. As the scientists celebrate in their lab, one scientist accidentally spills a bottle of liquid onto some electrical wiring. This causes a surge of energy to flow to a nearby experimentation platform where a yellow bow is falling. As the bow touches the platform the surge of energy is released, and Ms. Splosion Man is created. For the first time in the series the character will escape the fictional Big Science facilities and venture out into the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ms. Splosion Man&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
