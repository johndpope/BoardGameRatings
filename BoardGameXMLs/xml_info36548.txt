			<description>This game appeared in the August, 1996 issue of Games Magazine. It can be played on any flat surface, and requires cards, dominoes, coins, or any other objects that can be arranged in rows and columns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with &amp;quot;campers&amp;quot; in a grid-like &amp;quot;campsite.&amp;quot; Players take turns moving campers from their opponent's campsite into their own, according to rules inspired by the &amp;quot;Game of Life&amp;quot; mathematical simulation by John Horton Conway. When no more moves are possible, each player scores points based on the campers in his or her campsite. In the simplest version, most campers wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
