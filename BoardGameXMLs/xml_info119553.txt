			<description>A game for couples to find out what irritates them in their partners and what they really love about them. The game board is divided into to two parts, the first part of the board is about the things you hate and as you go on, you'll get to the side of the board that's about the things you love about your partner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes three different categories. The annoying things in your partner, the really irritating things in your partner and the things you love in your partner. In the first three categories, the pair draws three cards and then both of them arrange the cards in order of most annoying or most lovable by writing them up on paper. The pairs take turns on whose point of view the cards are arranged. If they get the most annoying/lovable thing right, they'll move 2 steps, if they'll get all right, they'll move 3 steps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included is &amp;quot;What would you do category?&amp;quot; that challenges the partners to think how they or their partner would act in different specific situations, for example, how would you act if your mother-in-law would pay you a visit?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pair that crosses the finish line first wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
