			<description>&amp;quot;Spiele Minis&amp;quot; is a series of small surprise boxes (i.e., you don't know what you get) from Ravensburger. They are meant to be carry-on or gifts, suitable for children (&amp;quot;Mitbringspiel&amp;quot;). Some of the cubes contain actual games, others contain magic tricks, puzzles etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with 28 double-sided cards. &lt;br/&gt;On their turn players must chose a design from the cards in the middle of the table. Each card indicates how many copies of that design are in the game.  Then they must try to find all copies of that design, one by one. If they do (without revealing any wrong card) they get those cards and then he must place them by the other side before them. So, when a player chooses a design from the middle of the table that has a copy in front of other player then he steals that card. The game will end when there are no more cards n the middle of the table. The winner will be the player with more cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
