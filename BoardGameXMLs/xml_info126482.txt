			<description>Subtitle: Supernatural Horror RPG&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sabres &amp;amp; Witchery is a role-playing game nominally set in Europe (although it could be elsewhere) at the end of the English Civil War through to  approximately the Napoleonic Wars era.  The time-period of Sabres &amp;amp; Witchery is not specific &amp;ndash; it could be any time from the late 1600&amp;rsquo;s to the early 1800&amp;rsquo;s; the &amp;quot;Age of Enlightenment&amp;quot; through to the &amp;quot;Industrial Revolution&amp;quot;. You don&amp;rsquo;t even need to clearly define it before you start play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is based on a set of 'old school' fantasy role playing rules, which itself was based on the first fantasy role playing game.  You are free to publish your own adventures, house-rules, and any other sort of materials designed for this game. Guidelines and requirements are at the end of the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is assumed that characters in the game will be mainly treading paths in wild out-of-the-way places &amp;ndash; tangled forests, wind-swept moors, dark mountain valleys and storm-ravaged coasts. They are hunting horrors that other people prefer to avoid and those horrors are only out at night, in the darkness and where they can&amp;rsquo;t be discovered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
