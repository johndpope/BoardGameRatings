			<description>David Leadbetter's Golf Game is the one game that's guaranteed to lower your golf scores. The game board depicts an aerial view of a 9-hole course with yardage markers in and along the side of each fairway to move your pawn from tee to green.  Using the dice, players choose their club (one dice is a wood, two dice are used for an iron) from the fairway or from the teeing ground.  There are 1600 questions in four different categories that comes in to play from time to time, plus multiple-choice answers and &amp;ldquo;hints&amp;rdquo; if needed. You will enjoy learning all about golf, while actually playing a round of golf on the board and of course, low score wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
