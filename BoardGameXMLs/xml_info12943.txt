			<description>GO Mental is a trivia game in which each card has a list of four items. On a player's turn a card is drawn and he attempts to name the one item that is unrelated to the other three. If correct, the player moves his token one space on the map board's triangular track of boxes. If the player can identify what the three related items have in common, he moves his token three spaces. The other players can attempt to provide the answers if the current player fails. The players may also use Steal cards and Challenge cards, which serve to add some strategy to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
