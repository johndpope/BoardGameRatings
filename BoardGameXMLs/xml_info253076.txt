							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Door of Stars</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The Door of Stars marks the third adventure in a path set in the fabled lands of Maztica.  In this adventure you will need to travel to a city occupied only by the undead creatures known as the mictlaneca who think of themselves as being still alive.  Then you will have to find and fight your way to the fabled Door of Stars - a multiworld portal that can bring the party to any number of Mesoamerican based worlds and settings.  Finally, you can revisit the land of Mechica - a world first introduced in 1983 in Dragon Magazine under the same title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite this being the third adventure in a series, it can also be used independently.  There is no need to play the first two adventures, though they can certainly enhance the experience for PCs.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer summary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
