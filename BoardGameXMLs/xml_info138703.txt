			<description>This is a variant of Bohnanza using horses instead of beans; it is a licensed product for Wendy magazine, a German magazine focusing on horses. (There is also an animated TV show and so forth.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Bohnanza entry:&lt;br/&gt;As card games go, this one is quite revolutionary. Perhaps its oddest feature is that you cannot rearrange your hand, as you need to play the cards in the order that you draw them. The cards are colorful depictions of beans in various descriptive poses, and the object is to make coins by planting fields (sets) of these beans and then harvesting them. To help players match their cards up, the game features extensive trading and deal making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is not identical to Bohnanza. The deck does not include an equivalent to the Garden Beans (6s), and from two to five of each type of horse are foals. When a foal is turned up as one of the cards to be traded, if there is only one player breeding that kind of horse they get it automatically. If a paddock has a foal on top when it is scored, it is worth nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other differences include the lack of the ability to buy a third paddock (field), the lack of a rule prohibiting scoring a paddock with a single horse under some circumstances, and the inclusion of rules for two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
