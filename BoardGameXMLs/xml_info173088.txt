The village needs aid from a aged witch that lives deep in the swamps and sends the heroes to seek her out. But will the swamp devour them before they can come to the aid of Wyverglynn, or will the fervored tribe of lizardmen within flay them alive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do battle against the environs and hazards of the swamp along with an entire tribe lizardmen, baby froghemoths, poisonous insects, ancient crocodiles, bullywugs and of course, the legendary Five-Fold Maw itself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure concludes with an amazing chase scene that will challenge even the most heroic of characters.
