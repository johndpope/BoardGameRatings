Explore the Egyptian terrain of your domain, looking for supporters to stave off invaders, more followers to help explore, etc.  The details you must manage and gambles you must make grow more complex as the game progresses, but each level is self-contained.  One of the designers, Andrew Leker, said of the game, &amp;quot;A level consists of 85 carrots and one big stick. The player takes 85 turns discovering and rebuilding his or her empire, where every turn creates some kind of goodness.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
