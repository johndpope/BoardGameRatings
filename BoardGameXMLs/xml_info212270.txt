			<description>Shabono takes the players to the rain forest of Venezuela.&lt;br/&gt;The shaman of an Indigenous tribe plays with the village children the popular and traditional Shabono game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The settlement of the villagers consists of a coherent ring of individual huts, called Shabono. In this central open space of Shabono the children have to prove to the shaman who is the fastest collector among them. At the same time the shaman pours coins from a tree trunk with animal motifs, which the children must collect as quickly as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At Shabono the players perceive the roles of the Indigenous children as well as the tasks of the shaman. &lt;br/&gt;The aim is to collect the animal motifs as quickly as possible and to reach as many points as possible, because the coins have different values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the shaman is also guardian of the time and determines by his skill how long the respective collection lasts. In addition, the shaman, with the hand of the &amp;quot;coin of the quick hand&amp;quot;, indicates with which hand to be collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game Shabono is played in two rounds. In each round, each player is once a shaman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first round the players must collect coins of an animal motif.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second round, the players must collect coins from two different animal motifs. It can happen that two players have to collect the same animal motif. The colored toucan must always be collected by each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game with the special coins, the players also have the opportunity to influence the game through various actions of the coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
