			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No matter how well prepped a GM in, players always have a way of heading in a direction that wasn't planned for. Enter QuickDelves! These micro adventures are perfect for filling in the gaps between the main points of your campaign. Each QuickDelve features a stocked adventure area and just enough fluff to spark ideas and let you mold the adventures towards whatever means you need, be that a MacGuffin to recover, an enemy to slay, a damsel to rescue, or just an interesting place to explore. Room/encounter descriptions are succinct, making them quick and easy to read while running a game; instead of paragraphs of text describing a room, a skeleton is presented with map icons and a sentence or two, leaving the GM free to tailor the flesh in a manner fitting their game and players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though written for the Mithgarthr RPG and themed for use in the Kingdom of Karak, QuickDelves are loose enough to easily be worked into any Fifth Edition game with little to no effort (and most OSR games with minimal change).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lodge of Bagbod Smashfish&lt;br/&gt;Levels: 2-3&lt;br/&gt;Type: MacGuffin&lt;br/&gt;Enemies: Goblinoids, D&amp;yacute;rverr, Ogre, Skeletons&lt;br/&gt;Setting: Dungeon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
