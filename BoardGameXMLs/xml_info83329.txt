			<description>From the box: &amp;quot;Buzz wants to fly...but a tangle of toys stands in his way! Make it through his outrageous, out-of-control stunt, and you might earn enough badges to win!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment: Shades of Mouse Trap and other Rube Goldberg type games! You and the kids build this thing with ramps, tracks, connectors, swivel assembly, towers, soldiers and a catapult...among other stuff...and here's what happens when everything has been put together and someone has moved along the board to land on a Buzz Lightyear space:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(From the instructions) &amp;quot;Buzz, on the Red Baron car completes the loop and spins Rex around; Rex knocks the yellow/purple Hot Wheels car down the ramp; The Hot Wheels car rolls across the board and hits the bottom of the Toy Soldier Stack; The top of the Toy Soldier Stack tips forward, knocking off the Parachute Soldier; The Parachute Soldier lands on the Uno teeter-totter, flipping up Woody's Horse; some or all of the Buzz Badges could fly out of Woody's saddlebags. If it was your Big Stunt, you get to keep the badges that fly out!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the one who gets eight badges first, either from Woody's saddlebags or from landing on Buzz Badge spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
