			<description>NASCAR Racing was released in the fall of 1994 for MS-DOS personal computers. It featured more than 25 of the 40 regular drivers in the 1994 NASCAR Winston Cup season. Notable absences included Dale Earnhardt (who would go on to win the Winston Cup that year), Bill Elliott, Dale Jarrett, Kyle Petty and Darrell Waltrip, although the latter's brother, Michael, was included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game let the player race with up to 38 other cars (32 on shorter tracks like Bristol and Martinsville) and it also offered multiplayer action via direct links (one computer connected to another via a LAN) and also through an online system owned by Papyrus called Hawaii.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CD-ROM version of the game also offered a SVGA graphics mode which was accessible through the command prompt (by entering &amp;quot;nascar -h&amp;quot;), but it was too demanding for many of the computers of its age, mostly 486 and early Pentium PCs. A hardware accelerated version was later created and bundled with the Matrox Mystique video card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, NASCAR Racing , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
