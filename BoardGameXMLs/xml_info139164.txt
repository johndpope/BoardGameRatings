			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This project was inspired by the re-release of the core books of the Advanced version of the world&amp;rsquo;s most famous FRPG. At the time of the announcement, I was thrilled that these books were to be re-released; however, I personally would have preferred if the entire library had been made available in various forms. I was subsequently challenged to re-imagine one entry in the library rather than simply wait for that library to see the light of day. This module is my answer to that challenge &amp;mdash; a re-imagined version of the first module in the classic A-series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this is written for the retro-clone Labyrinth Lord&amp;trade; using the Advanced Edition Companion&amp;trade; expansion and inspiration from The Realms of Crawling Chaos&amp;trade;, it is still easily used with the re-released core books with little to no conversion for those who are interested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
