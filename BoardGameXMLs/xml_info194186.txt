			<description>This is a simple print-and-play fantasy Card Game with pre-constructed decks, simulating small scattered battles in the everlasting greater war of good versus evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a side (good or evil), and tries to win the battle by discovering and researching powerful resources to eventually use in the greater war, such as spells, relics and enchantments. Players can hire heroes to hinder the opponent&amp;rsquo;s exploration, but for that they will have to face enemy dungeons and their challenges, such as guardians and traps, built to protect the resources being processed inside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, the goal of each player is basically build dungeons by placing challenges over the table, and then trying to process resources inside. While keeping these resources protected against enemy invasions, the player will also want to disrupt the progress of the opponent, which is acquired by forming a party of heroes to raid the enemy dungeons. During invasions, six-sided dice are rolled to decide success or failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
