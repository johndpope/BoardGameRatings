			<description>Army Men Advance was a Game Boy Advance launch title released by the now-defunct 3DO game company. It is a 2D game in their moderately successful Army Men franchise. Much like Army Men: Sarge's Heroes, the story has General Plastro and his army of tan figurines have decide to take over the world and it is up to Sarge and reporter Vikki G. to thwart the conquest. Throughout the game you will be required to rescue team members, infiltrate tan bases, escape from a jail, investigate an extra terrestrial presence, and retrieve communications equipment. You can choose to play as either Sarge or Vikki, but the quests for each are identical and once a character has been chosen it is impossible to switch to the other unless you want to start again from the first mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Army Men Advance&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
