			<description>Emission TF1 game presented by Arthur TO TAKE OR LEAVE based on a simple random choice to win the most money possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 22 boxes and each box has amount of money from 1 cent to  500,000 Euros from the game. Each player chooses one of the boxes he places before him. &lt;br/&gt;The game is played in as many rounds as there are players.&lt;br/&gt;In turn, the player chooses one of the remaining boxes, removing it from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the player has eliminated three boxes, the bank calls the player to make the proposition: &amp;quot;Take it or leave it.&amp;quot; To do this, the player takes a fictional phone and presses a button, lights flash then stop pointing the choice &amp;quot;Silver&amp;quot; or choose &amp;quot;Exchange&amp;quot;. If &amp;quot;Silver&amp;quot; appears, opponents offer money in exchange for his box, and if the player accepts, it affects the amount and withdraw from the race (the box is opened and proved its value) refuses the game continues and the next player. If &amp;quot;Exchange&amp;quot; appears, the player decides to share or not to box against that of a competitor or against a box not yet eliminated. Player may cancel the offers and exchenge and continue his play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If all players have chosen the boxes the player with the biggest amount of money in his boxes is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
