			<description>Book Bugs is a collectible, deck-building, card game for 2 to 4 players, created by National Library Board, Singapore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visitors to any of the participating public libraries can collect Book Bugs cards in three ways:&lt;br/&gt;1. Borrow 8 books from the library to redeem 2 normal cards.&lt;br/&gt;2. Complete a library activity to redeem 1 shiny card.&lt;br/&gt;3. Attend a library programmer to redeem 1 shiny card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player deck is made up of 30 cards. These are put in the player's draw pile. The player's play area also has a discard pile and a playing field. Each player starts with 5 cards in his/her hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To determine who starts the game, each player draws a card from the top of their draw pile. The player that draws the card with the highest points starts the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During each turn, the player starts by playing a card on his/her playing field. The effects of the card played takes place immediately and only lasts one turn. Each player must play only 1 card per turn. The player ends his/her turn by drawing a card from his/her draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to achieve a total of 20 points wins the game. Alternatively, the game ends when one player runs out of cards in his/her draw pile. All players will then have to count the total number of points from the cards on his/her playing field. The player with the highest total points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
