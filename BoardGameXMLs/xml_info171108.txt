							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Interstellar Patrol</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intrepid officers of the Interstellar Patrol explore new worlds, make first contact with friendly species, and face down criminals and aggressive neighbors alike. Their state-of-the-art ships are bright and clean. Their form-fitting uniforms come in designer colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by optimistic space fiction such as the original Star Trek, Interstellar Patrol is a sci-fi campaign frame for Fate Accelerated Edition. Your characters are the crew of a starship charged with protecting the Coalition of Worlds and expanding the bounds of its knowledge. In addition to example aspects and stunts for your characters, Interstellar Patrol  also includes rules for using spacecraft in your FAE game and guidelines randomly generating alien worlds and adventures to have on them.&lt;br/&gt;Go forth, explorers, and be bold!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
