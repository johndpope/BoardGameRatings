							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Little Thunders</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Security is tight at the Little Thunders where the Storm Elves&amp;rsquo; military is based. But there&amp;rsquo;s been a huge mistake! The big mucky-mucks assumed all slaves were spies and evicted every one of them. Now soldiers trained to fight are getting mutinous. Slopping pots makes them so testy they&amp;rsquo;re concocting any excuse to start a fight. So be careful. Make sure your party isn&amp;rsquo;t the spark that gets the fight going. Free the Great Dragon instead &amp;ndash; he&amp;rsquo;s raging with a demonic entity inside the storm on top of the towers. Fighting  for a Great Dragon, you&amp;rsquo;re always on the side of the good guys. One more thing? If you can find out where Arvian is, sign him up too. He&amp;rsquo;s got the genes, but needs some help getting his identity confirmed. This fight should do it. So pick your battle. Help the Dragon. Help Arvian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
