			<description>Each player (red or yellow) starts with 4 randomly positioned cities each with one emperor piece (large cylinder) and three warriors (small cylinders). Each turn two dice are rolled with two different pieces being moved along interconnecting lines between or into cities. A warrior which lands on a piece removes it from the board. An emperor landing on a piece removes it from the board. An emperor passing over an opposition warrior paralyzes it with a white disc until an emperor from its color lands on it. Pieces landing on paralyzed pieces or pieces of their own color move to the next square. Towns are taken over by moving two warriors into them. When this happens any opposition pieces still in the city are removed from the board and one of each type may be returned to the board by the invader. While they have one or more piece in that taken city it is not able to be entered by the opposition.&lt;br/&gt;Game ends when a.) all opposition towns have been taken. or b.) all opposition pieces taken and or paralyzed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
