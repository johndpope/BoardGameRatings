			<description>I Obey &amp;ndash; the Campaign of Bezzecca 1866&lt;br/&gt;This one is an operational game on Garibaldi campaign over the Alps during the initial and central phases of the Third Italian War of Independence. It was a strange, fascinating campaign by one of the most famous generals of his time, not only in Italy. Garibaldi&amp;rsquo;s red shirts fought and won against a superior, but very dispersed Austrian army, that tried to force Garibaldi to a slow and depressing struggle over mountain passes and cliffs, but was surprised in the decisive battle of Bezzecca that opened the road to victory for the Italian general that was stopped by a direct order of his king (to which he responded simply &amp;ldquo;I obey&amp;rdquo;, giving up a sure victory on the field for a political one for his country).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a very peculiar chit drawing activation method and a combat system that stresses fatigue over real casualties, I obey is a fascinating study of this neglected campaign, with a see-saw motion of the counters over the splendid map and the chance for both sides to gain an unexpected victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medium complexity, 2/3 hours playing time, both for competitive and solitaire play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Released as Print-n-Play in June 2007&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
