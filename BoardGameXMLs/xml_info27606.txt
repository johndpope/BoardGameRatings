			<description>As far as I know this is the only set of miniatures rules specifically dealing with air-to-air combat between helicopters, though air-to-ground and ground-to-air combat is also covered. The rules are intended for use with 1/300th scale miniatures and the other game scales are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 model = 1 aircraft, vehicle, infantry platoon&lt;br/&gt;1 turn = 10-15 seconds&lt;br/&gt;1&amp;quot; = 100 yards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn the player picks the speed and altitude for each helicopter they control, which determines how far they will move, how much they may turn and their chance of crashing into the ground, if flying too fast and too low. Combat is resolved using the usual die rolls and tables, with the different makes of helicopter being able to take different amounts of damage before they are eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The majority of the rule book is taken up with the helicopter data sheets and there are no less than 46 of them. Ground elements are detailed generically. There are also five sample scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
