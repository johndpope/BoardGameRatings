			<description>This is a new fun innovative board game that educates players about business professions, ethics, politics and promotions.  Players choose one of five professions and move around the board earning kudos for their accomplishments. These professions include: Technology, Operations, Marketing, Accounting and Sales. If the player has enough kudos when they reach their review, they receive a promotion to the next level. The first player to reach the CEO level becomes the winner of the game.  During the game, players will experience corporate politics; be challenged by questions; make management risk decisions; and learn about business tools. In addition, there is an optional team play to develop teamwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
