							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">King of Storms</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One thousand years ago, the gods and titans slew one another in a great battle for the heavens. In their destruction, their blood rained from the heavens, permeating the earth, and drenching the soil. Centuries passed. From this blood arose powerful beings, capable of unearthly feats. Some were born of god&amp;rsquo;s blood, noble and perfect. Others were born from titans blood, twisted and malevolent. A third was born an abomination of the two &amp;mdash; half god, half titan: the bloodless gorgons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the Storm is coming. The time of ascendancy is at hand. The kingdom can have but one ruler &amp;mdash; the King of Storms. Which child of heaven shall take his or her place upon the throne?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And who will be consumed by the Storm?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Praxis is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters into dramatic situations and is based on the principles of the Protocol game system. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start-points, roles, plot twists, and finales. Praxis does not play like a traditional roleplaying game. It does not require a gamemaster. There is no script. No endpoint. No cumbersome or extraneous mechanics detracting from the story. An entire epic can be played in under four hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
