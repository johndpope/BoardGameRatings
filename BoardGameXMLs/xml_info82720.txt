							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tycoon City: New York</name>
									
			<description>Tycoon City: New York is a 2006 city-building game where players are tasked with developing New York City, specifically the island of Manhattan. The game also allows players to build many of the city's most celebrated landmarks, including the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, the Statue of Liberty, and the United Nations Headquarters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two game modes are available:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Build New York: The &amp;quot;campaign&amp;quot; form of the game. Players build New York district by district, starting with Greenwich Village. The player must complete certain tasks and compete with business rivals in order to unlock other districts for development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Sandbox: The free building form of the game. Players have control over the entire island. The amount of competition, their rate of building, and starting amount of cash can be controlled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regardless of which mode the game is played in, the game starts with an empty district which must be developed. Players choose from different types of buildings, including residential, commercial, and recreational. To add to the realism, several brand names (including Staples and Loews Theatres) can be built. The player must attract customers to raise funds by upgrading their buildings. This can include flowers, extra seating, signs, air conditioners, or water towers. Landmarks can be constructed by earning landmark bonds. Unfortunately, the player has no control over the positioning of streets, as in some other city-building games. The focus on individual businesses and their needs reflects that of Deep Red Games' earlier business empire game, Monopoly Tycoon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tycoon City: New York&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
