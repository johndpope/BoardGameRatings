			<description>The Black Bass, known in Japan as The Black Bass II (ザ・ブラックバスII), is a NES fishing game, developed by Hot-B and released in 1989. The objective is for the player to catch as many black bass as possible from sunrise to sunset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player may select a beginner's game or ranking game. A ranking game requires a password. From here, a player may select a location on the lake to start at and begin fishing. Simply tossing a lure out with the desired power will start the process. A fish can be lured in by moving the lure around and if it bites, then the player can try reeling it in. Care must be taken, however when reeling, as too much constant reeling leads to the line breaking, and the loss of both the fish and the lure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between casting rounds, the player can make certain selections. Among the selections available is the option to change the type and or color of lure being used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Black Bass (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
