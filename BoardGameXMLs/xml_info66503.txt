							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Shrine of Glass-Spire Forest</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Shrine of Glass-Spire Forest&amp;quot; is a Chaos Scar Side Trek/adventure designed for five characters of 2nd level. This scenario consists of a skill challenge and two encounters, so you can run it in the Chaos Scar campaign or as a short stand-alone adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;There are many strange places beyond the great wall, that edifice which has spawned a thousand stories. But perhaps none are so strange as the place that adventurers call &amp;quot;the glass forest.&amp;quot; Those few who have returned from journeys in the great valley tell of the keening that arises near this strange locale when the wind blows to the east, as if a thousand wind chimes had been set in motion.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
