			<description>The Triade de Diamants, three identical diamonds, having broken the laws of nature, have become a marvel gracing the greatest museums on earth. Until now...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jack Sly is a diamond thief attempting to become a legend by collecting all three diamonds. Gregory Lestrade III, descendant of Scotland Yard's Inspector Lestrade, is determined to create his own legacy, by bringing the master thief to justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Sly, a puzzle card game for 1-2 players, Sly sneaks across the cards representing three museums, endeavoring to manipulate them to his advantage, uses the tricks of the trade to snatch the diamonds, and attempts to escape before the police can catch up with him. Will you get away, or wind up imprisoned? If you can't take the heat, you're not Jack Sly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
