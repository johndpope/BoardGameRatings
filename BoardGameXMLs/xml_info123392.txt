							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grand National</name>
									
			<description>Grand National is a British computer game that was developed by Andy Williams and Paul Holmes based on the horse race of the same name. Similar in parts to games like Hyper Sports and Daley Thompson's Decathlon, the game had a novel twist of being able to bet on the outcome of a race also.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea of the game is to race your chosen horse around the course of Aintree winning the race and also having a little bet on the side.  Gameplay at times was tedious and tiring as players were also required to compete in the race by hammering keys alternately and making the horse jump fences at regular intervals.  Movement consisted of furious keypresses and occasional jumps twice around the course.  The game can be lost by losing the race, a steward's enquiry, or a fall at a fence.  Bets could be placed on any number of horses at various odds, you could even back your own horse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games animation and graphics were excellent and featured a split screen. At the top of the screen was a side on view of the horse in any impending jumps. The bottom half of the screen showed an aerial view of the race and the course, how many horses retired, fell or still racing. A summary of the player's position and leading horse number was also on screen, lap number and where the player was on the course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Grand National (computer game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
