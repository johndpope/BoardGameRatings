							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Democracy 2</name>
									
			<description>From Official Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever wanted to be president? or prime-minister? Convinced you could do a better job of running the country? Let's face it, you could hardly do a worse job than our current political leaders. Crime, Unemployment, National Debt, Terrorism, Climate Change... Have you got the answers to the problems that face western industrialized nations?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Democracy 2 is the ultimate political strategy / simulation game. The game simulates the motivations, loyalties and desires of everyone in the country. As president or prime minister, it's your job to balance the need for income from taxes against the demands of the voters. Do you want your country to be an eco-friendly green paradise? or a capitalist utopia? Will you pander to the patriots, the liberals or the religious pressure groups? Can you keep crime under control without destroying the civil liberties of your citizens? And can you keep good diplomatic relations with other nation states?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
