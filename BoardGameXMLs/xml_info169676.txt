							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Abomination Tower</name>
									
			<description>Abomination Tower is a humorously macabre, 2D procedurally generated platformer. The game is set in a tower where the rejected creations of a mad scientist are left to die. You play Headless, one such creation, trying to escape the tower and find freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Headless is in a unique situation that allows him to equip different heads that are unlocked as you progress through the game. Each head has it&amp;rsquo;s own identity and with each identity comes a unique ability. Collect eyeballs and finish the level to unlock heads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Controls&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abomination Tower is best played with a gamepad controller but a keyboard can be used. Use the spacebar to jump and the directional keys to move if using a keyboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
