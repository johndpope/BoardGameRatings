			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the ages, an organization has existed, that has at its heart the idea that mankind can not be trusted with the responsibility of emotional, spiritual and mental growth - that mankind must be coddled like a child. This agency works for no government, nor for any private group, although it has been known to employ them to reach its own goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever something arises that threatens to show humanity the potential it holds, reveals universal secrets or exposes ideas and concepts long thought to be impossible, they arrive to &amp;quot;spin&amp;quot; the incident to their own mechanisms. Sometimes they use threats, sometimes they just plant doubt, and sometimes it becomes necessary to eliminate the threat to their blueprint completely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
