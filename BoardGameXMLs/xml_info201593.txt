							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Royal Gambit</name>
									
			<description>From the instruction manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Royal Gambit is the exciting new game of skill that combines the color of medieval pageantry with the thrills and fascination of ancient warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for two, three or four players, Royal Gambit is played on a board representing four ancient mountain kingdoms joined in the center by lowland meadows. Combat takes place among the kingdoms for possession of the entire area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each kingdom consists of a castle and an army of 10 mobile pieces: A King, four Nobles and five soldiers. Royal colors for the kingdoms are orange, black, white and yellow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the course of battle a King may be elevated to Emperor by capturing a rival kingdom whose forces have not been severely reduced. Title of Grand Emperor is bestowed on the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
