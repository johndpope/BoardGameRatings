			<description>Pitch'n Goal is a flicking sports simulation along the lines of Pitch'n Dunk, Pitch Bowl, or Caveman Curling. Just as those games simulate their respective sports, this one simulates soccer (known as football everywhere but the USA). Discs represent the players and the ball. The game sports variants for 3&amp;ndash;4 participants and star players with special abilities. The first team to score 2 goals wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
