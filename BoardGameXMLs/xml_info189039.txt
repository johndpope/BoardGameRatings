			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Entry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         This RPG item was a submission to the #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge.  It was developed by three different designers in a randomized, anonymous fashion.  For details, and for information on how the versions are structured, see the series RPGGeek entry here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge 2015. All of the entries are available here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Winners and Everything&lt;br/&gt;Entry #156; Stage One: Grant Howlitt; Stage Two: Shoe Skogen; Stage Three: David J. Blair&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Themes&lt;br/&gt;Supernatural space horror and otherworldly exploration. Inspriation should be drawn from such games as Dead Space and Doom, as well as movies such as Event Horizon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What You Will Need to Play&lt;br/&gt;You will need a standard deck of 52 playing cards for a 2 to 5 man game (There are plenty of stylized Bicycle Playing Card decks on Amazon if you wish to have a deck to match the theme of this game). If you wish to play a longer game, or play with more players, add another deck. You will also need to keep track of player stats either via pen and paper or electronically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number of Players&lt;br/&gt;Two (2) to Many (although a group larger than 6 will be difficult to control). One player takes the role of the Game Master (GM) and weaves the tale of horror for the rest of the players to adventure in. All other players will take the roles of the special elite operatives working for The Authority.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Synopsis&lt;br/&gt;Space explorers quest into The Deep; Breaches in reality that exist in-between the darkness of space, under centuries-old frozen oceans, and in the forgotten ruins of alien civilizations. These elite operatives are on missions for The Authority; A joint military organization that seeks both knowledge of what is within The Deep and information on how to contain and seal it. The stress of survival and the deaths of their companions push even the strongest operatives into instability and madness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
