			<description>From the box: &amp;quot;Intersect brings the skill and fun of crosswords to a fast paced action filled card game.  Intersect can be played three different ways - Intersect - Intersect Solitaire - Intersect Rummy.  The deck consists of 90 playing cards: 69 one-letter cards, 10 each two and three-letter cards and 1 four-letter card.  The object is to be the player to score the most points.  Points are scored by making words from the cards in your hand.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the basic game, players have eight cards, must make one word per turn, and must use one letter from the previous player's word.  Each player scores points for the cards they play that are unused by the following player.  Cards are worth 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 or 50 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
