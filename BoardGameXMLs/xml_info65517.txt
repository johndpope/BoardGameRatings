							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Squint</name>
									
			<description>This game is played with a standard deck of cards. Each player is dealt 10 cards, the remaining two is called Squint. Players then put a card face down on the table, which shows their bid.  They can choose cards representing they are able to win six tricks without trump, six tricks with the suit of that card as trump, no tricks at all without trump, or none of the above. The better bid wins, in case of a tie both players have to try to win the number of tricks they claimed. If everybody chooses none of the above, the suits of the bid cards determine the contract (even partnerships can be formed). Then one or more players, depending on the contract, may exchange cards with the squint, and then tricks are played. The score is given only to the player(s) with the highest bid, and depends on the contract and the number of tricks won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
