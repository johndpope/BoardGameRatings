			<description>(From the Eagle Games website)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description : The American Revolution is a game of grand strategy and tactical battles during the war for American independence. The players take control of the war effort of either the thirteen colonies, as they attempt to gain independence from Britain, or the British as they try to suppress the rebellion and maintain control of their American colonies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players maneuver armies of Militia, Regulars, Hessians, Indians, Artillery, Dragoons, and Leaders. When opposing armies come together, they fight desperate tactical battles. To win the battle, the player must break his opponent&amp;rsquo;s battle line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can the American colonists defeat the strongest power in the world or will they be beaten into submission?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-fight the war and change the course of history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hundreds of magnificently sculpted miniatures that represent the various types of units that made up the armies of the era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A gigantic 46&amp;rdquo; x 36&amp;rdquo; gameboard. .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 sets of rules from basic to advanced.&lt;br/&gt;The basic rules allow the player to dive right in and start playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced rules allow a more detailed and historically accurate simulation of the conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 to 4 players&lt;br/&gt;Recreate the entire war in an afternoon. Change History!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
