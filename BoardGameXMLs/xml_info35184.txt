							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bunjee</name>
									
			<description>Bunjee is a simple dice rolling game with some risk management. Each player is playing a figure jumping from a tree, trying to fall low enough to reach the goal but not too low to avoid crashing on the floor. On his turn, the player launch the dies, hecks the result and decides to satisfy himself with the result of the dices or roll some dices again to better his score. Of course, re-rolling the dices includes some risk. Mechanism is very close to the Can't Stop from Sid Sackson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
