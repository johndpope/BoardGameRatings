			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fate Codex is a mostly-monthly e-zine featuring Quick Start Adventures and more for the Fate roleplaying system. The project, funded through Patreon, grows and swells as more patrons support our work. We've been lucky to have lots of folks pledge, and we're now entering our second year of production!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our backers have enabled us to not only hire great authors, but also to include great art in every issue. Issue 2 of Volume 2 features Marissa Kelly, Mike Mumah, and Juan Ochoa! There's some great work in this piece and over 10,000 words of awesome Fate content, ready to be thrown into your next game of Fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now we're bringing this content to you on DriveThruRPG, so you can find and download your issues easily. Since every title is saved to your library on the site, you'll always have The Fate Codex right at hand when you need it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this second issue of Volume 2, we've got:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Clark Valentine's guide to using corruption as a devil's bargain in Corruption in Fate Accelerated.&lt;br/&gt;    Jason Corley's tips on using GM-prepared aspects, Pre-Generated Aspects, to help players jump directly into intriguing Fate fiction.&lt;br/&gt;    Mark Diaz Truman's essay, At What Cost, that contrasts Fate with Apocalypse World to learn new things about the nature of Fate conflicts&lt;br/&gt;    Marissa Kelly's quick start adventure, Forged by Fates, a two-player plus GM adventure set in a Greek-inspired world filled with monsters and warlords.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
