			<description>From the official website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the fifth installment of the award-winning tactical level game system by John Tiller. It contains 70 individual scenarios covering the fighting from 1950 until the ceasefire in 1953. Alternately, a campaign game is included, with three different campaigns from which to choose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features include satchel charges, smoke, wire, mines, gliders, paradrops, artillery, mortars, armored fighting vehicles, and many more. Players typically control several squad sized elements and possibly several vehicles in each scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new submap editor is included which easily allows players to create smaller maps from the larger maps included with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
