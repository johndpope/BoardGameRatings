							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Renown: The Game</name>
									
			<description>Renown - The Game brings back a traditional Austrian card game. The original game is still played in Austria but it is getting more and more forgotten. Decades ago there were many tournaments and it was played in almost every tavern. It is called &amp;ldquo;Schnapsen&amp;rdquo;, probably because the winner was rewarded with a shot of schnapps. We have modernized it with a lot of modifications, action and player interactions. We have added a set of action cards which can alter the whole gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Renown - The Game features four different races: the bloodthirsty Ogres, the forsaken Humfrogs, the greedy Goblins and the schnapps-loving Shiners&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the first one to earn 48 points by beating your enemies in different round types to win the game. Send your characters into fights and gather 66 Renown which you need to get your beloved points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To reward the best strategic player there are seven different round types, which give you more points, the more difficult your strategy is to follow. Some of the rounds require you to earn 66 Renown fast, others will challenge you to win all the fights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each race has five different characters, who are ranked like this: The Chief, the Warden, the Sorceress, the Soldier and the Dork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start each round by selecting a dominating race, which makes every member of this race stronger than any card of the other races. When a player plays a character, the other players usually have to follow with the same race, if they have one. The higher ranked characters beat the lower ranked ones. This means: The chief beats everyone from the warden to the dork, the warden beats everyone from the sorceress to the dork and so on. If a player does not have a card of the first played race, he has to play one of the dominating race. If the player does not have a card of the dominating race either, he needs to send another race into the fight. However, this one cannot beat the first played card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
