			<description>A dexterity game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: Nerv&amp;iacute;ky (Czech/Slovak) = nerves (to be more precise: little nerves).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set-up: One player (the catcher) has a small cup, and a die with different colours on its faces. The other players each have a differently-coloured wooden piece (yellow, red, green, or blue) with a string attached to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game: Players try to receive the least amount of penalty points for their poor reaction times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variant no. 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The catcher rolls the die, if the roll is yellow, red, green, or blue, he/she tries to catch, with his/her cup, the colour rolled. If he/she rolls white, he/she attempts to catch all of the colours; if he/she rolls black, he/she is not allowed to catch anything. The other players, according to the result of the roll, either try to escape (by pulling on the string) or do nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variant no. 2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The catcher says three colours at random (e.g., green, blue, black) and rolls the die. &lt;br/&gt;If he/she rolls one of the colours he/she said, he/she tries to catch as many of the other players as possible and the other players try to escape as quickly as possible (again by pulling on the string). If the catcher rolls a different colour than he/she said, the other players do nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring Points:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a penalty point to the catcher if he/she does not catch any of the other players, or if he/she accidentally catches any of the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a penalty point to the other players (with coloured pieces with strings) if they are caught by the catcher, or if they accidentally pull their pieces back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
