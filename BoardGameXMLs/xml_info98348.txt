			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A real down-home skeet shoot! The target spins through the air as you raise your shotgun and fire. Good shooting keeps the target bouncing between the players. An explosive 12-gauge juggling act builds a big score! Blast the target past your opponent to score points. Play long or short games and vary the number of targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dog Patch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take aim and fire at a can that is tossed into the air. In this down home skeet shoot, score points for every can you hit; extra points are awarded for knocking it over the head of your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to score the highest number of points by targeting and hitting the most cans. With two good marksmen, the can will bounce back and forth several times before being shot to the other side of the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every time a player hits a can, one point is awarded. A can may be hit more than once by either or both players and, as a result, each player will receive more points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a can is hit over the opponent, 12 points are awarded. If it is hit twice, 14 points are awarded; if hit three times, the score increases by 16 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the highest score when there are no cans remaining to be tossed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
