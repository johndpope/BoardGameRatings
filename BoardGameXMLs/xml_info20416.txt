			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bet you didn't know that Sibling Appreciation Day was in the same month as Mother's Day. And National Relaxation Day is the day before Joke Day, with Watermelon Day two days after. In this game of fun days and holidays you must take the dates you're dealt and rearrange them in chronological order. So plan your strategy and pick your day. You may even find a new holiday as you play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
