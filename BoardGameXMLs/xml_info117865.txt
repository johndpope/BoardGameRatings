							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Four-handed Chivalry</name>
									
			<description>This four-handed pure abstract has both partnership and individual versions. The object is to capture all opponents' pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces jump like in checkers but in all directions and can jump (without capturing) friendly pieces before capturing any opponents' pieces. So the jumps can become very complex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uusually a clear vitor will emerge before the final pieces are atually taken-- but not always.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those familiar with Chivalry (1888) or Camelot (1930):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four-Handed Chivalry uses the standard Chivalry board, but is very different in several ways from the standard Chivalry game, as well as from Camelot or any Camelot variant:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Unlike all other Camelot variants, only Knights are used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Unlike all other Camelot variants, the solitary object of the game is to capture all opposing Knights; moving Knights into a Castle has no significance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Unlike Grand Camelot, in the partnership version of Four-Handed Chivalry, partners sit opposite each other, and move rotation passes clockwise around the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
