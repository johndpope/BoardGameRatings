			<description>Kamen Rider : Operation Shocker is a fan-made print &amp;amp; play adventure game based off the Japanese superhero show &amp;quot;Kamen Rider&amp;quot; since 1971. It's a team-based &amp;amp; cooperative game for one to five players. One player will play the evil organization &amp;quot;Shocker&amp;quot; who will lay different plots to conquer Japan. The other players will play as Kamen Riders who must stop the plots before it's too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each turn, the Shocker player will recruit shocker troops, kaijin(monsters) and build secret base to lay evil plots. The Rider players must move to uncover the plot before it's completed. The game ends after 9 turns. The Shocker player wins if he can complete plots worth 6 or more victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rider player each starts with a deck of 10 action cards. Each rider player draws 4-6 cards in each turn. He may play these cards to move on the map or fight monsters in cities but each action card cost a number of ki points. The deck also serves as the rider's hit point. Additional &amp;amp; more powerful cards will be added to the deck when a rider level-ups. Riders will gain XPs for KO troops &amp;amp; kaijins &amp;amp; will level-up when XPs reach certain points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
