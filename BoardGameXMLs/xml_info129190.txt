			<description>From the introduction and synopsis:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Cthulhu Rising adventure designed for 3-4 players, though with a little work could be run for a group of up to 6. It is&lt;br/&gt;intended to play out as a whodunit murder mystery, set on a world inhabited by the rich, famous and powerful of United Earth Federation (UEF) society&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Find out who murdered my daughter.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last words spoken to you by Lucien Voltaire play over and over in your head on a loop, as your suborbital begins its landing approach to the crime scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terra Nova. Playground for the rich, famous and powerful of Federation society. A planet inhabited by people with tastes far too expensive and exotic for your blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Events have moved fast. Ex-colonial administrator Lucien Voltaire obviously still has a lot of political weight, because he has managed to get you assigned to a murder investigation, the victim being his youngest daughter, Adeline Voltaire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He calls it a murder investigation anyway. The local police certainly arenÂ’t calling it murder. Their verdict is accidental death, and before Lucien Voltaire started pulling strings they were ready to close the case after only a day of investigative work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A weather front has blown in unexpectedly from out at sea, causing your suborbital to make a bumpy landing at the beach-house of Adeline Voltaire. Rain starts to lash down in sheets as you gather your equipment and your thoughts, and prepare to meet your local police liaison...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
