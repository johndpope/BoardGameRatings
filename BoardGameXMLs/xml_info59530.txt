							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tower of Babble</name>
									
			<description>Tower of Babble is a party game in which players try to build 4 levels of a ziggurat. The game is played by drawing topic cards (such as &amp;quot;Russia&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DNA&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Shakespeare&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Little Bighorn&amp;quot;) and then talking about the subject for a specified amount of time. Players must speak in complete sentences, may not repeat themselves, and may not use words like &amp;quot;Um&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Uh.&amp;quot; The higher a players tower gets, the longer they must talk about the subject. If a player doesn't know anything about the subject they may make up their facts so long as they don't violate any of the other speaking rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a game board, tower pieces, and four sand timers in 30, 60, 90, and 120 increments. The first player to Babble through the 4th level is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
