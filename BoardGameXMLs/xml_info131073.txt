							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tetragon2</name>
									
			<description>Tetragon2 is an abstract strategy game for 2 that can play very quick, or take longer, (15 mn to an hour&amp;quot;) depending on the match up. Tetragon2 is a game of creation, and the first player to create two tetragons wins...possibly, the other player gets one more move!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The play pieces are triangle in shape, made of maple and walnut, real hard wood! Each player has 9 wood triangles, there is no capturing and no jumping, the pieces move in a variety of ways, forward one square, sideways one square, backwards one square, or diagonal as far as you can go without pivoting or hitting another piece. Tetragons in the center four squares are 10 points, and  anywhere else they are 5 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
