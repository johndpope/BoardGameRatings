			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t you wish instead of messing up your character sheet keeping track of who many charges you have let in your wand or forgetting what the range of the spell is for the wand someone else would do that for you?  Now you don't have to. With Campaign Props: Magic Wand Sheet you can have all the info on what type of want, what level of the spell and how many chares are left just on one sheet right at your finger tips.And best of all you can print them out and only use the ones you need, without flipping back and forth through a tone of books.This 16 page PDF is just the sort of thing needed for Players need to have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
