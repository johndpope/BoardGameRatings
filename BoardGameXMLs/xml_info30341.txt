			<description>Described in the book Beyond Competition, Resources is a cooperative game where players take turns collecting resources on the game board.  The object of the game is to keep the distribution of the four resources between the players as even as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement on the board is done by jumping when possible  or moving to a spot when not.  Bonus are awarded when all the players have the same number of a particular resources.  Penalty points for a resource are given at the end of the game for each resource another player lags behind the leader.  If the resulting score is positive - everyone wins; if negative - everyone loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
