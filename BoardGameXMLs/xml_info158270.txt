			<description>Sites are shuffled with the Safe-Houses to a &amp;ldquo;sites deck&amp;rdquo;, before setting up the game. Each player (beginning with the first player) draws one site from the sites deck and chooses which direction to place it in towards the player to their left. That site marks the shared Faction between the player who placed it and the player to their left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that a site provides a special ability to the player towards whom they are facing (i.e. their text is facing). These abilities apply as long as the text is facing that player. If the site is turned (e.g. by the Engineer), then the ability is then granted to the opposite player of that Faction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion was not included in the 1st Kickstarter, but was sent to those who had issues with the delivery of the game, as a free bonus.&lt;br/&gt;In the 2nd Kickstarter, this deck was bundled in the new &amp;quot;Break the Rules&amp;quot; expansion, together with Break-The-Rules and Commanders decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
