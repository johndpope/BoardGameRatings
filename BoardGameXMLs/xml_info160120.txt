			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this adventure for for TAG's WHAP! rules by award-winning game designer Ken St. Andre, a gang of American outlaws &amp;quot;vacationing&amp;quot; south of the border are approached by two old villagers who ask them to come save their town. The men say that beasts from hell are attacking the village: carrying off children, destroying the livestock, terrorizing the women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why would a gang of outlaws want to face &amp;quot;beasts from hell&amp;quot; for a couple of geezers they just met? Well, Don Geronimo and Don Tarmanganio have an answer, presenting our heroes with some samples of gold ore still in its quartz matrix and saying that much more of the yellow metal can be found in the old abandoned mine near the village of Mescalito.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes three new western-themed character types in addition to the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
