			<description>Binary is a series of 4 games that use a unique deck of cards.  One side of the deck is all black the other side is all white.&lt;br/&gt;The games require a basic knowledge of binary numbers, which the rules provide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Binary I - a basic game of each player dealing out 4 cards and the highest number takes the pot. (an introduction into binary numbers)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Binary II - similar to Binary I, but players lay the 4 cards one at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Binary III - similar to Binary II, but players lay the 4 cards one at a time, allowing players to raise if they believe they will have the highest number&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Binary IV - players across from the table play with the same 4 cards to change it into the highest number.  Each plays from their own perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
