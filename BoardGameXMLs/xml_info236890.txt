							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lost Temple of Sharess</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beneath the home of a wealthy merchant named Haroun, a floor suddenly collapses, revealing the entrance to a deep, dark cavern. But judging from the screams and laughter coming from below, this is more than a common cave. Will you conquer the long-forgotten horrors it holds? Will you discover fabulous treasures in its pitch-black passageways? And most importantly: will you learn the merchant's own secrets before it's too late?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lost Temple of Sharess is a one-off adventure, designed to be played in one or two sessions. Though it's meant for first-level characters, suggested tweaks allow dungeon masters to make things tougher for those of higher levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
