			<description>Two to four players compete for Electoral votes, based on their knowledge of U.S. state capitols and their luck with a spinner. Starting with the player who has the spinner, the player who correctly guesses the state associated with a given capitol city gets to mark the state with his peg. When all states are claimed, the player with the most Electoral votes (as determined by the 1927 map board) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the time of this game, red was the color of the Democratic party and blue was that of the Republicans (vs. the current Republican=red state, Democrat=blue state association). For the third and fourth players, the Independent (yellow) and the Prohibition (natural) parties are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
