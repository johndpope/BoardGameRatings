			<description>Sink the Biz (originally &amp;quot;Sink the Bismark&amp;quot;) is a dexterity game traditionally played at Nick's English Hut in Bloomington, IN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played using a metal bucket filled with beer, with a small weighted juice glass (the &amp;quot;Biz&amp;quot;) floating in it. The bucket is placed in the middle of the table, within easy reach of all players. Each player has a glass filled with the same type beer that is in the bucket. Players take turns pouring small amounts of their beer inside the floating glass. Usually players agree on a minimum height from which the beer must be poured into the Biz. Also, it is generally acknowledged that just a drop or two of beer are not enough to satisfy one's turn requirement. In case of any ambiguity in this sense, all the other players vote to decide whether or not a pour was enough. If it is decided that the active player did not pour the minimum amount, the active player must pour again before his turn is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who sinks the Biz must recover it from the bucket and drink all of its content. After that, the Biz is placed back in the bucket, players' glasses are refilled, and the process is repeated. Players may drop out of the game at any time. The game is over when only one player remains in the game. That player is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game allows for limited strategic decisions. The main strategy is to fill the Biz as much as possible during one's turn, to make it more likely for the next player to sink the Biz. This is, however, a calculated risk, as the player attempting this technique may end up pouring too much beer and sinking the Biz as a result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
