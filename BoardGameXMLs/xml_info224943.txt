			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome back once again dear reader! We are buzzing here at Irregular Magazine to be able to present Issue 3 of Volume 2 of Irregular Magazine for Spring 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this issue, we have a number of great articles!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have taken a good, and perhaps long overdue, look at the Pathinder RPG that is a favourite of many role-players worldwide as well as a discussion about how RPGs can be a solution to fitting gaming into our increasingly busy lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an examination of new games: Cornish Smuggler, from Grublin Games; The Football Game, a football club management game from London Games Company and much anticipated Walking Dead tabletop game from Mantic Games, based on the TV series and movies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our editor continues with his various challenges to get as much of his grey army as possible into a nicely painted state &amp;ndash; and he&amp;rsquo;s now added the miniatures from his board games to the list! He&amp;rsquo;s also write a nice guide to simply painting 1/72 scale miniatures with the help of dip varnish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll also be looking at Blood Bowl in a Blast from the Past; although it is also a current game with the recent re-release of the perennially popular games from Games Workshop celebrating 30 years since it was first released!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alex has taken a good look at the latest Star Wars film, Rogue One (spoiler alert ahead!) giving us an in depth review as well as his thoughts for the future of Star Wars films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We also have a great review of one of the most popular apps on the planet: Pok&amp;eacute;mon Go, from the pen of Sophie Fiest that is well worth a read!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jason has written an overview of the kinds of terrain that was around in the pre-Roman period, which is a superb inspiration for anyone looking to build terrain for either this period, or indeed later periods, of historical gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We also look forward to both the UK Games Expo 2017 and Salute 2017 shows in the UK; as well as looking forward to what other games we should expecting to enjoy in 2017 as Alex reviews the games and updates we expect to be released!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time to get reading &amp;ndash; go on, download your copy now!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
