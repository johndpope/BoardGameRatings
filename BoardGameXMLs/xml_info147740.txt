			<description>Tripods! is a competitive, strategy survival game set during a Martian invasion of Victorian London. Two to four players take control of a number of playing pieces representing the populace of the city and are trying to score as many points as possible by the end of the game. Points are awarded for helping citizens escape, keeping them alive until the Martians are destroyed and killing the Martian war machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inhabitants of London have no say over the greater workings of the Martian invasion or the government's response to it, relying on garbled rumours and reports to keep them informed. Game plays out over a fixed narrative of eight 'Headlines', which reveal the next stage of the invasion and events within the narrative are controlled by a 'Tidings' deck which instructs the players how to manipulate the invaders and the military who are trying to counter the threat. The Tidings deck also contains the Red Creeper, which spread across the board as the game progresses. Once consumed by the alien plant a space is no longer safe from the Martian's terrible Death Ray. These Tidings can be manipulated by players through the use of five Character cards, each of which has a special ability and each of which can be used only once per game so timing must be chosen carefully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escape from London is achieved by leaving the board from one of five stations or the docks. As Headlines are revealed these escape routes begin closing and as the Martians grow more prolific, the Red Creeper spreads, the available military units dwindle and escape routes shut so the tensions build and players begin to turn on each other to compete for the few remaining avenues of exodus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
