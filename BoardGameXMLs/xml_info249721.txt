			<description>Your master, the mage Theodocred, charges you with finding a three-horned slug. Arming yourself with courage, you go into the night, but as soon as you enter the forest a creature comes up and claws you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now a werewolf, will you survive your first transformation, werewolf hunters, and other unforeseen dangers? Choose your specialty, thief, wizard or barbarian, choose the right paths, and find an effective weapon! The choices are yours in this game book!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loup Garou is a comic combined with a game, one title in a series subtitled &amp;quot;The comic in which you are the hero&amp;quot;. You embody a character in a immersive story in which your choices guide your progress. You have a character sheet akin to those used in role-playing games that tracks your possessions, your  your coins, and your victory points. In general, gameplay consists in following the comic's panels &amp;mdash; which contain clues, riddles and traps &amp;mdash; and making choices about where to go and what to do, while using your visual perception to collect clues and be smart enough to resolve the riddles. As in any game, you can lose &amp;mdash; sometimes really badly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
