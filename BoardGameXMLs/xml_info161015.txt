			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An online &amp;quot;team vs team&amp;quot; third-person shooter with a twist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each match, 8 players are randomly divided into 2 teams. The goal of the match is, however, not to shoot the enemy, but to paint the floor in your team's colour. The team who has painted more floor when the match ends (after 3 minutes) wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are equipped with either one of many kinds of guns that fire paint, or a roller, or a paint brush or a bucket or any other kind of paint-spreading thing. The player characters are a sort of semi-human semi-squid (called &amp;quot;inklings&amp;quot;), and can switch to squid shape at the press of a button. As a squid you can't fire, but you can swim in your own colour becoming almost inivisible, you move in double speed and also reload your ink tank (ammo). If you paint walls, you can swim up on walls in this manner; though painting walls won't count towards victory. Moving in your enemy's colour makes you slower and will do slight damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Getting hit by the enemy repeated times will cause you do splat into the enemy's colour, and you'll have a several seconds wait until your respawn at your team's starting point. It's possible to send yourself flying to a team-mate's location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Together with the typical twin-stick FPS control scheme, the Gamepad's gyro is used to complement the right stick's control in which direction the player is looking; a system that is very effective for precise aiming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also has a 2-player mode where two players run around on a stage trying to shoot balloons, and a single player mode where the player needs to clear stages of enemies and find secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
