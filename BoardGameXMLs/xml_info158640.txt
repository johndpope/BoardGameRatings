							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Three Pillars: A Paranormal Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The Three Pillars is a fast-paced, witty game of checks and balances that celebrates the paranormal community while gently satirizing the drama that is often encountered within it. Assemble your team, visit haunted locations and submit evidence to close the cases - but be warned - not only must you deal with Murphy's Law, but with other paranormal teams investigating the same places as you - and chances are, they won't be helpful. Never before has Paranormal Division been so fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players compete to score the most points they can by playing Evidence cards at three separate locations. Each turn a player picks up a card and either plays or discards a card - each time they are faced with a choice: they can play a card to help themselves or to hinder their opponent.  Event cards are triggered at various points in the game to introduce an element of randomness and can either be good or bad - you never know!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meant as a stand-alone game, it can be played straight out of the box.  Expansions are being developed to keep gameplay fresh, while maintaining the core rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
