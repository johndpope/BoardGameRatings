			<description>Your fate has already been sealed. Now it's just a question of time. They have picked up your human scent and you can already hear them. It's time to make the last stand and take some of them with you. Armed with your standard issue motion tracker and your trustworthy assault rifle you will have to fight them as long as you can. They are coming from all directions and there is only one of you. You will eventually run out of life, but luckily you have lots of bullets to spare before that. How long can you survive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
