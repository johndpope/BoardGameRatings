							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Morphean</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;There are some people who, when faced with a nightmare, relish the fear, finding a deep connection to the very essence of their souls. Those who learn to tap into the nightmares of others and use them as weapons are known as morpheans. Presented within the pages of The Mind Unveiled: Morphean is a new psionic base class - the Morphean - as well as a variety of new feats, powers, items, and a new prestige class aimed at this new base class. In addition, several variety of qael, nightmare creatures that exist within the Dreamscape, are also presented for use with the morphean base class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fulfilling the role of scout, sneak, and even assassin, the morphean instills fear into his enemies and, sometimes, even his allies. Unleash the darkest of nightmares in this new release from Dreamscarred Press.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 27 pages of new material for both players and GMs, The Mind Unveiled: Morphean details everything you need to play or use the morphean class, as well as offering several new psionic creatures to use in your campaign. The Mind Unveiled: Morphean is written by Andreas R&amp;ouml;nnqvist, whose other works include High Psionics: Psicrystals Expanded and High Psionics: Sequestral Feats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mind Unveiled: Morphean builds off the free release The Mind Unveiled: Dreamscape. While The Mind Unveiled: Dreamscape is not required for use, it is strongly recommended.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
