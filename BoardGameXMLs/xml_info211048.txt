			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was originally released by Dollarsoft as &amp;quot;Bombscare&amp;quot;, before being re-released on Firebird's Silver range. As Firebird already published a game called Bombscare, it was renamed &amp;quot;Short's Fuse&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the inlay (Short's Fuse):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That evil bounder Boris is up to his old tricks again, planting multi-detonator bombs in capital cities and holding the world to ransom. The swine! Now that his demand has been refused the beggar has actually set off the first fuse ... detonation time minus nine seconds. The cad! Our chap, Sam Short, will do his damndest to refuse each detonator before ignition, but he might need a bit of help. Lucky you came along, what!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written By : Richard Stevenson and Philip Durbidge&lt;br/&gt;Amstrad CPC Graphics converted by : David Wright&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
