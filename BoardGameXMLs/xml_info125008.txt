			<description>The Commonwealth has decided to send the galaxy into martial law, sending probes out to all neighboring planets to keep an eye on any illegal contraband or fuel cells being used for the hyperspace lanes, a comfort only allowed by the Commonwealth and their Inquisitor Probes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have a destiny. You must travel from planet to planet from your home world, finding work to upgrade your ship or to obtain fuel cells, all while trying to find that one clue, just that one clue to your goal. The goal you yourself must accomplish. Be careful though for Inquisitor Probes run up and down the hyperspace lanes looking for folks like you. The Syndicate aren't that much fun either, placing embargo ships on planets and playing &amp;quot;pay the toll&amp;quot;. You can do it though. I know you can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After Objectives have been handed out, players take turns moving their Ship Tokens between the Planets, searching at each Planet first for their Objective&amp;rsquo;s Clue card and, once found, for their Objective&amp;rsquo;s Goal card. The first player to find their Goal card and return their Ship Token back to their Home Planet, residing there for one full rotation of players, wins the game! It sounds easy but you&amp;rsquo;ll want to collect Fuel Cells along the way, upgrade your Ship, take the occasional long route to avoid the Inquisitor Probes roaming the hyperspace lanes, complete jobs to earn rewards, ward off the Syndicate, and constantly be alert to the danger of other players attacking you. It was never going to be easy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
