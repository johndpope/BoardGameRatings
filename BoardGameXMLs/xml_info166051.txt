			<description>The Karms is a new finger flicking game with just a dash of dicey luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Played on a 13X13 grid players are trying to be the first to flick each of the eight pieces (think backgammon or crokinole discs) across the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces are introduced, or moved based on the roll of two D6 dice. A  piece can move the value of a single die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player also has a steel guard piece he places at the end of a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The flicking part comes at the start of the 2nd players turn. His first action is to place a wall piece and then user the striker disc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The striker is 'flicked' and can rebound off the wall. The idea is to push an opponent's piece farther from its goal, or advance one of his own pieces closer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
