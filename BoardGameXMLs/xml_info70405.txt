							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mutual of Omaha Health and Safety Game</name>
									
			<description>The game is a pure roll and move game printed on the back of a world map handed out to US schoolchildren in 1983/84 in a promotional tour for the program Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. The world map on the obverse side has a large inset advertising both the game and the program. Players move tokens in turn at the roll of a die (d6), neither tokens nor die being included, starting at a space marked &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; and ending at a square marked &amp;quot;beach&amp;quot;. The health and safety theme is a bit heavy-handed in the directions on many of the spaces of the board. No directions are included but the winner is the first to reach the beach. The track of the board describes a schoolchild's possible day from leaving home until going to the beach after school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
