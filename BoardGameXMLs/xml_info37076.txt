							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Question Box Game</name>
									
			<description>The Frederick H. Beech company put out this game The Question Box in 1939. The game was a trivia type game where you conducted and answered what the game called a Radio Question Bee. Questions about trivia from Radio Shows of that time were featured. You drew from a large number of card questions with different degrees of difficulty and asked another game player who tried to answer the question correctly. He/she then scored points based on getting those questions correct.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
