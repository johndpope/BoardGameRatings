			<description>From the PDF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOGGLE STONES is a role-playing game of fantastic adventure set in a past that never was. When the forces of darkness grow too strong to be contained in the world of the Faerie Kingdom, the fiends then cast their shadow over the dawn of 20th&lt;br/&gt;Century America. Can the goblins, elves, and dwarves put aside their differences to ally with the Great Republic of these United States? Can alchemy and sorcery stand up to locomotives and six-guns? How can a nation founded on liberty work together with a king and queen? What chance does any man or woman have against fear, when fear itself is a force all too real?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is NOGGLE STONES? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Noggle Stones takes place in the United States of the 1900's, but not the one we know from the history books. At the turn of the century, a miraculous magical event reunited the Earth and the long-lost land of Faerie in to a single world. Once again, humans live in the same world as the fae people: the regal Aes Dana, the insular Dwarves, the eccentric Goblins, and the reclusive Ogres. Now, just as the United States was beginning to recover from the struggle of the Civil War and connect the two coasts with the transcontinental railroad, the nation must cope with this strange new state of affairs. Your adventures take place in this exciting time, when the magic and technology of both worlds are coming together!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
