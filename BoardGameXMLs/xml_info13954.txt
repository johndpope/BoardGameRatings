			<description>&amp;quot;A game of automobile conflict in the 21st century&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People create their cars and fill out Vehicle Control Sheets, then pick a scenario (all of which take place on a 5-lane highway) and start attacking each other.  Players normally take one car each, or a cycle pack, picked randomly with a die roll on the encounter chart.  (Used for generating random traffic.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanics are a lot simpler than most games of this type - movement is composed of making lane changes and moving forward based on your speed.  Acceleration/deceleration and movement is plotted secretly, then simultaneously revealed - each turn each car will move one space forwards or sideways for each 10 MPH of speed, broken up into four phases. (Scale is 20 feet per square.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only one car (or two motorcycles) is allowed per square - if two cars try to move together they 'bump' and start rolling for critical damage.  Players can roll to make 'emergency' changes to their plotted movement (which is restricted, for example a 'right' move can never be changed into a 'left' move.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat occurs at the end of every phase.  Drivers can fire one turret, (a group of weapons mounted in one of eight directions) gunners can fire two.  Any/all weapons can be fired each phase, which makes for a lot of shooting opportunities, which is good since weapons only fire in a straight line (front/back/right/left/diagonals.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenarios include the basic duel, &amp;quot;Rush Hour&amp;quot; where there is a chance for random traffic to enter the highway (is what the on-ramp is used for) and a Death Race with 3 to 5 players racing sets of identical cars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes in a small box, closed with a folding flap like a satchel, complete with 3 highway boards (so you can put the rear board in front and keep driving) counters for the cars, lots of charts &amp;amp; tables, car control sheets and a rule book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
