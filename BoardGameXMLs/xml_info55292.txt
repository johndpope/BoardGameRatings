							<name  sortindex="1">Larry Lasso und die wilde Jagd nach den Banditos</name>
									
			<description>Each cowboy takes up his lasso. The first player throws both colour dice. Now, all players try to catch the bandits matching the colour(s) of the dice with their lassos and to pulling the bandits to their jail at the corner of the board.&lt;br/&gt;Throw your lasso from the edge of the game board in the direction of the bandits. When throwing the lasso, you may not hold your hands or the lasso over the board.&lt;br/&gt;A bandit is counted as caught as soon as he stands completely on the jail. The player removes the lasso and places the bandit in front of him. The player may try to catch more bandits right away. When all bandits with matching colours are caught, it is time to pay the reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
