							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Moogh</name>
									
			<description>The dark night goes pale. Slowly thin streaks of light lift up like hair and splits the insipid sky. A drop of blue slowly bleeds out in the ocean from the center and out. &amp;ldquo;Moogh&amp;rdquo; said the male tribe leader. All others around him in the cave opening knew what it meant. Gathering the stingers they made from flint and sticks they set off in the now golden pink but cold morning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scuffling through the dense woods and out in the plains they could see their prey towering in the distance under the sun which had now shown its full face. &amp;ldquo;Ugh Moogh Oog&amp;rdquo; they exclaimed. A few moments later it was all a vortex of hairs and muscle, blood sprouting, shouting and stabbing their shafts with flint spearheads into the huge beast. The Mammoth chase had begun - Will they survive the fight and who will be the one that finish off the big beast&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moogh is a semi coop game for 2 or 4 players playing two tribes trying to defeat a &amp;quot;Moogh&amp;quot; in a blood n' fur hurly burly. Each player controls the cavemen who are moved around a square grid board chasing their prey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each caveman has some unique abilities so they need to cooperate to win. The Moogh is controlled by the &amp;ldquo;game&amp;rdquo; and players use a control card to determine its actions. Unfortunately the Moogh has a rage that increase every time the cavemen attack it and when it gets angry it is equally difficult to kill. Cavemen can only take 2 hits before they die - and when they get hit the first time they turn their card to reveal a different set of abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tribesmen get savage points for actions they take during the game and among the survivors - the team with most savage points will win leadership of both tribes. A game will last about 25 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
