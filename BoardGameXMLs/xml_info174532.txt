							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Advent Saga: Tactical Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Advent Saga is a story-driven physical and digital Tactical Card Game that combines the excitement and traditions of popular card games, with the strategic elements of Tactical RPG's. The game takes place in an original universe where a devastating war is waged upon 3 different galactic factions. Players will choose from hundreds of cards to battle with, while discovering endless possibilities in combat strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advent Saga is a highly customizable game, in that each of the 5 resources have their own strengths and weaknesses, while each of the 10 advents have unique abilities that set them apart from each other. This allows you to build a deck to cater to your own style of play! The object of the game is to reduce the opposing Advent&amp;rsquo;s morale to zero. This can be achieved by strategically using the cards in your hand to deploy, attack and dominate your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One goal with Advent Saga was to add elements that rewarded meaningful choices over just drawing powerful cards. With the creation of our 4x4 battleground, players would not only need to rely on strength and power, but would also need to discover and develop new strategies involving Battleground position, Range, areas of effect, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
