							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Formula One Arcade</name>
									
			<description>Formula One Arcade is a racing video game developed by Studio 33 and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation. The drivers featured on the front cover, from left to right, are Eddie Irvine, Michael Schumacher and Jarno Trulli.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Formula One Arcade is based on the 2001 season, the game was centered around hectic racing action and is considered unrealistic [1]. Players compete in a quick race of just a few laps , collecting checkpoints to keep the time and have to collect pickups such as a speed boost (which make the car faster), large tires (which gives the car more grip) and shields (which make the car invulnerable).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_Arcade,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_Arcade,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
