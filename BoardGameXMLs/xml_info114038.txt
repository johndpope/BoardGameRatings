							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paragon: HDL Second Edition</name>
									
			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This update to the HDL Universal Tactical Role-Playing Game revises and expands upon the quick, realistic rules based on the Half Die Level system. The rules are still just as fast-paced, adaptable and deadly; class- and level-free, the possibilities for character evolution and adventures are unlimited. The new expanded rules improve overall customization with even more Backgrounds and Weaknesses, optional rules and clarifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paragon introduces the Active Delay combat system, which departs from the turn-based combat of many RPGs for a more fluid and engaging experience. Now, combat flows organically, with each action taken having its own delay in time rather than arbitrary turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ESPers, Cyborgs, Sorcerers and Dragons&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brand new chapters include dozens of unique, mind-blowing psychic abilities, integrated and revised cybernetics rules, and an all-new magic system complete with more than 380 spells. The added bestiary is rife with real-world and fantastic creatures including dragons, vampires and werewolves, as well as detailed rules for creating new creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
