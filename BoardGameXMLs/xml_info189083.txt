			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crafting and using constructs is a difficult proposition. Constructs are expensive, difficult to repair, and require a certain mastery of spellcasting. The engineer scoffs at such excuses, turning all her intellect and work ethic towards creation. Spending years locked away in schools and laboratories, she explores all the secrets constructcrafting has to offer. The engineer&amp;rsquo;s creations are her sword, armor, and art. While learning to craft her automatons might make her a peerless master in any number of areas, her first love is always the design and creation of magical life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role: An engineer fights alongside or within her constructs, relying heavily on creations during combat. An engineer&amp;rsquo;s power comes from careful preparation in modifying her servants and crafting items of power. Many engineers concentrate on improving personal fighting capabilities, modified heavily by worn automatons and magical items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
