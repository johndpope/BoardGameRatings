							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hamlet: A Murder Mystery</name>
									
			<description>Hamlet: A Murder Mystery  is a lavishly produced edutainment game, based on the Castle Rock Entertainment motion picture &amp;ldquo;Hamlet&amp;rdquo; starring Kenneth Branagh and Kate Winslet. The game, which is a co-production between Pantheon and Castle Rock-Entertainment, offers multiple levels of game play, including puzzles, swordplay and multiple forays into Elizabethan knowledge and science -- hidden in dusty books in the subterranean vaults underneath Elsinore Castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the disc contains the complete and unabridged text of the original Hamlet play by Shakespeare, with each page linked to scholarly commentary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To produce the game, Pantheon artists painstakingly re-created all the locations and sets used for the Castle Rock motion picture &amp;ldquo;Hamlet,&amp;rdquo; cast as 3-D virtual reality environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Critically acclaimed and enjoyed by game aficionados as well as schools and colleges nationwide, Hamlet: A Murder Mystery delivers on the promise of a new form of entertainment and education made possible by digital multimedia technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hamlet: A Murder Mystery was co-written by Prof. Arlene M. Stiebel and Jean-Pierre Isbouts, and also directed by Isbouts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is distributed by EMME.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
