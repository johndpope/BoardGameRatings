			<description>Le quiz de comment (The How? quiz) is an educational trivia game aimed for kids.&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 7 cards in 7 different categories. The goal of the game is to get rid of the cards a quickly as possible and score most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One by one the players play out a card with either a solo or group question. The solo question has to be answered by the player. If right he scores a point, otherwise he draws a new card of the same category. &lt;br/&gt;All players can try to answer the group question simultaneously. The quickest scores two points. If a person gives a wrong answer he draws a new card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has no cards left. The one with most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
