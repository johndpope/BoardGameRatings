							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pixel Boat Rush</name>
									
			<description>A frantic arcade combat boat racing game, full of popular culture parodic references and set in a 2D sidescrolling pixel art environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay mixes a one-touch racing mechanic with 2 weapon/defensive buttons. The progression features an in-depth career mode and RPG-like humoristic conversations with parodic characters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An easy to learn, hard to master, fun arcade racing game with loads of content!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One-Touch Racing Mechanic:&lt;br/&gt;Touch to accelerate, release to brake.  If you release the gaz on a wave, you'll stick to it. If you keep the gaz pressed, you'll jump off the waves.  Releasing the gaz while in the air will make you fall faster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obstacles and Power-Ups:&lt;br/&gt;If air drag makes staying on water quicker, sometimes it's best to jump. I could be for grabbing a power-up, avoiding an obstacle or a tricky set of waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat:&lt;br/&gt;The second button is used for weapons, which adds a completely different dimension to the game. There's pistols, shotguns, machine guns, rockets, lasers, mines, grenades launcher, rail guns, beam guns, boomerangs, stun guns, burst guns, blasters, torpedoes and so on. The game becomes tactical as you save your ammo for the right moment, retreat to a more secure position and avoid being literally obliterated to pieces or let opponents tearing themselves apart before acting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the second half of the game, a third button is introduced for a secondary weapon or an active system which can stun, boost, jump, repair or shield you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The progression of the game has similarities with classic simulation racing games where you progress through licenses tests and various racing events spread across 4 racing categories. There's about 50 different boats, each having its own equipments configuration and behaviour, characterized by top speed, acceleration, downforce, braking and armor. Acquired boats can be upgraded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
