			<description>Panda Craves Danger is a game all about eating weird, and often dangerous, things that more intelligent beings would steer clear of. Why you ask? You are a panda, an adorable, achingly cute ball of fur with only one problem: You and your fellow pandas have grown tired of bamboo and are craving something more exciting. The trouble is, you don't know much, so you have a hard time telling what's food and what's not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter the the Danger Buffet! A line-up of some of the most exciting, er, &amp;quot;foods&amp;quot; that you have ever seen. Throw caution to the wind and eat everything in sight, but be careful &amp;mdash; the world is full of dangerous things, and you may end up biting off more than you can chew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a set of 12 custom danger dice, each panda takes turns alternating between eating dangers from the buffet in front of them and resting to heal up and to digest (score) the dangers they've consumed with the goal of digesting a combination of dangers worth the most prestige by end of game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
