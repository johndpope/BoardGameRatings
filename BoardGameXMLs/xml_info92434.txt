			<description>From Adventure Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages ago, a brood of dragons failed to accomplish a task set to them by the fae. Duped by another fae, they unwittingly gave up a great treasure, the Soul Box. The members of the brood fell to petty infighting, dishonoring themselves, and eventually coming to blows. Each time they have re-incarnated, they come together. But as they re-connect with their previous lives, they remember their ages-old failure (and falling out), begin arguing, and again fail to complete their original task. Sometimes they even destroy each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Soul Box has changed hands many times over the eons. The fae within the box can grant the person who possesses the Soul Box great power to influence other mortals, for good or ill, by making him or her a sort of nexus point for karma. The current owner is Damian Locke, a powerful member of the Gehenna Consortium. He keeps the box in his townhouse in Richmond upon Thames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the great wheel has come around again, and the scions are reborn in the modern age. Once again, the brood comes together, to share their dreams and remember, and maybe this time, finish the job they started so long ago!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lock, Stock, and Three Smoking Souls is an adventure for six starting scions, and can be played at conventions or to kick off a Fireborn campaign (see &amp;ldquo;Raw Recruits&amp;rdquo;, pg 19 of the Fireborn Gamemaster&amp;rsquo;s Guide).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tone is meant to be somewhat tongue in cheek, but the adventure can easily be played as serious as you want it to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A GenCon 2005 Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
