			<description>Downhill Domination is a video game based on a fictional racing event with fictional racers mixed with a few unlockable professional racers. The game was released for the PlayStation 2 and received favorable reviews for its open ended courses but was not highly successful commercially.&lt;br/&gt;The game differs from standard bike racing games by having the character riding downhill almost exclusively (hence the name), due to the incline of the tracks. Attacking is also encouraged with two attack buttons, one for a left attack, and the other for the right. These attacks can be upgraded to more powerful attacks by performing tricks or collecting powerups. A bike shop with several unlockables for purchase is available but is only accessible in one player mode. Up to four players can play the game, but when playing with more than two, the available tracks and modes are limited.&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Downhill_Domination,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Downhill_Domination,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
