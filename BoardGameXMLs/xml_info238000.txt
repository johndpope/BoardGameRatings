							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dam Sitters</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a big hydroelectric dam up in the mountains. Intelligence thinks the enemy might make an attempt to destroy it &amp;ndash; either by direct assault or terrorist sabotage. The people who work and live immediately downstream would prefer that a squillion tons of watery death did not come their way! It&amp;rsquo;s the turn of the PCs&amp;rsquo; platoon to do some dam protection. Oh, and you have some journalists in tow, so try not to do anything too embarrassing while the cameras are rolling...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a system agnostic (i.e. systemless) military science fiction scenario. It provides multiple enemy plots against the dam &amp;ndash; you can pick one or use them all in an ongoing story arc. Resources for the GM include: maps; enemy tactics and objectives; bios and story seeds for a whole platoon of NPCs with whom the PCs can interact or the GM can utilise on this and future missions; and data on the planet and its animal and alien inhabitants. Nothing is statted up &amp;ndash; the idea is you use your favourite system and/or slot it into a campaign in whatever setting you fancy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is hard-ish science fiction, so the assumption when writing the adventure is that there are no energy weapons. Think bullets and body armour, not lasers and forcefields. The PCs will be assumed to be firing bullets, shells, missiles, grenades, calling on artillery support and hoping for air cover from craft which behave like shinier versions of modern military aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
