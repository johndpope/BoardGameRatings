							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Danger at Darkshelf Quarry</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A0 Danger at Darkshelf Quarry was first published by Wizards of the Coast LLC in 2013 as part of A0-A4: Against the Slave Lords. Alongside the classic A1-A4 series, the new A0 module was included as an introduction to the storyline. Danger at Darkshelf Quarry, written by Skip Williams in 2013, was developed to &amp;quot;create a campaign-friendly introductory adventure for the series.&amp;quot; Unlike the A1-A4 modules written for tournament play, A0 is written thirty years later to better guide new players through the treacherous world of the slave traders at the heart of this series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conversion guide allows DMs to run the original module with 5th Edition rules and provides a reference sheet for all encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To use this conversion guide you will need a copy of A0 Danger at Darkshelf Quarry. This module can be found in Against the Slave Lords, a compilation of the A-Series modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
