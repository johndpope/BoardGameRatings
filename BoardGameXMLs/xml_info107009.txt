			<description>Executioners is an arcade style fighting game for MS-DOS based PCs. Released in 1992, it marked the debut of Bloodlust Software, consisting of Ethan Petty and Icer Addis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally, the shareware version including the first two levels was distributed freely among bulletin board systems. Today the full game is available as freeware at the official Bloodlust Software site and several file sharing websites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Executioners boasted features like its large animated characters and smooth-scrolling VGA graphics, something few other DOS games had at the time. The game was also notable for its high level of animated blood and violence, although it was never rated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Executioners&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
