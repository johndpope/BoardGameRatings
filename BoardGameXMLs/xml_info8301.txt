							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">I Giochi del 2000: Gli Ultimi Templari</name>
									
			<description>Akin to Murder Parties, but with no murder at all. Players are the last Templar knights, 200 years after the disbanding of their Order. The Renaissance is just starting and they gather in the magnificent city of Urbino, trying to understand the mystery of an ancient book. Besides this, each of them has secret information and goals so there is quite a lot of intrigue during the session, besides the interpretation of the code and the magic ritual to be completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 32-page booklet contains all the playing materials to be cut and distributed to the players: character sheets and little handouts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The booklet belongs to &amp;quot;I giochi del duemila&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;The games of 2000&amp;quot;) collection: a series of role-playing games, game books, wargames, card games and so on that included 23 titles. The name of the collection refers both to the end of the millennium and to the price: 2000 lira, that means 1.03 euros, making them the cheapest games in Italy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
