			<description>As you might expect, this is a Monopoly version based on The Ohio State University.  The game functions exactly like Monopoly, however, as you may expect, the locations on the board are based on locations in the vicinity of Ohio State.  Locations include:  South Campus, The Oval, St. John Arena, Ohio Stadium, Long's Bookstore, and many others.  Of course, since this game was produced in 1986, some of the locations are dated and may not exist any more, like Papa Joe's, which sadly burned down more than 10 years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
