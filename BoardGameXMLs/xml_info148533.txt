			<description>The breakfast worms are coming! Twelve hungry baby birds stretch their wide-open beaks into the air. Will the busy parent birds manage to get enough food for all of them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Schmatzspatz, four wooden birds sit on the edges of the circular rotating &amp;quot;board in the box&amp;quot;, each with a worm in its beak. In the middle area are twelve hungry little birds with open mouths. A symbol die determines the sector of the board where the most hungry baby birds are. The player now decides which one of these birds to feed and tries to rotate the board to move one of the adult birds to the right position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The turning board occasionally blocks the feeding, however,so the players must remember these &amp;quot;blocked&amp;quot; positions. When the worm can successfully be fed to the bird, the baby closes its beak. If the players manage to feed all the baby birds before running out of worms, they win the game together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Schmatzspatz includes a competitive version in which each player tries to get rid of his worm supply first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
