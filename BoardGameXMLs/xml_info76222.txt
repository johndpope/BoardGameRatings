			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic Carpet is a unique first-person flyer game.  The player takes the role of a mage standing on a magic carpet that can fly rapidly in all directions.  The object of the game is to collect golden mana spheres that are required to a) build your castle and b) &amp;quot;heal&amp;quot; the world.  There are 50 world-levels, each of which consists of an oceanic planet upon which are found various islands.  Monsters and other mages serve as obstacles in gathering the mana; getting past them often involves engaging in visually spectacular magical flying combat in which a variety of fireball, lightning and other spells are cast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in 1994 by Bullfrog Productions, Magic Carpet was an unusual and innovative game that was never imitated.  An expansion pack called Hidden Worlds was released later, as well as a sequel, Magic Carpet 2, that appeared in 1995.  Magic Carpet was based on a voxel technology engine, which allowed for attractive graphics and very large environments for the time, but the technology was rapidly bypassed by the popularity of hardware-enhanced 3D graphics engines.  According to Jon Rennie, who worked at Bullfrog from 1996 to 1999, Magic Carpet 2 was rushed into release by Electronic Arts and the quality suffered as a result.  He also mentions that initial work was begun on an engine for Magic Carpet 3, but the game was never completed or released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
