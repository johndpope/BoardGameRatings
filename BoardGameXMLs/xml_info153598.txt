							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Heritage: Demonic Heritage</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlock a New Kind of Mythic Power!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sure, your character&amp;rsquo;s mythic path tells you about the kinds of abilities in which he specializes, and perhaps even gives some clue as to his ultimate mythic destiny, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t say anything about where he came from, and what made him mythic in the first place. For that, you can turn to a mythic heritage. This new aspect of mythic characters allows for further customization of your mythic character. A mythic character can choose a mythic heritage in addition to his or her mythic path, and doing so grants him access to a number of unique abilities that are designed to reflect the flavor of his heritage, while also being of value to characters of every mythic path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This installment explores the demonic heritage, and characters whose mythic power comes from demons, the abyss, or similar sources of evil and chaos. Whether your ancestor was a demon prince, your powers come from a profane ritual that you were exposed to as a child, or you&amp;rsquo;re simply tainted in some way by the foul presence of the abyss, this mythic heritage allows you to tap into that dark power. The book includes 17 new mythic abilities, all of which are part of the demonic mythic heritage. Summon mythic demons to aid you in combat, wield a balor&amp;rsquo;s flaming whip, tempt mortals with promises of power, and render yourself immune to anything that would target your black and shriveled soul. This is the power of the abyss, and it can be yours to command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
