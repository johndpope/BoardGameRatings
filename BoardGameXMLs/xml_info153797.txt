							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lycanthropes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The folklore of almost all H&amp;acirc;rnic and Lythian cultures includes tales of lycanthropes and their origins. Lycanthropes are people who have been cursed to involuntarily alter their form to that of a half-human, half-animal creature, typically during the night of a full moon. Although werewolves are the most common type of lycanthrope, the accursed may take on other forms, including that of a werebear or werecat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lycanthropes is a bestiary article that includes full descriptions and H&amp;acirc;rnMaster stats for the werewolf, werebear, and werecat. It describes how lycanthropy is spread and possible remedies for it, as well as how the various H&amp;acirc;rnic religions view the affliction. H&amp;acirc;rnMaster rules are given for GMs to generate lycanthropes, either as player characters or NPCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Portions of this article were originally published in 1988 as part of H창rnlore 8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
