			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, all you need to have fun with a class for another few months is a few new ideas to tinker around with. Class Expansions is a series of lightweight supplements for The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game that takes a base class and offers alternative class features that, handily enough, each fit on one page or less.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following in this vein, Class Expansions: Feats of Trolling introduces, funny how this works, feats for the smartass in everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Cat Effect - When anyone near you trips in combat, he takes 1d6 damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clean Getaway - Immediately move after successfully stealing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disruptive Interjection - When somebody near you makes a Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check, make an opposed check. If you win, reduce the result of the skill check made by the other individual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Embarrassing Critical - Your critical hits cut down the enemy's pants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forever Alone - Your Intimidate checks cause an enemy to be unable to use his teamwork feats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hot Potato - You can snatch and return alchemist bombs and other such explosives without them deactivating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improved Raptor Strike - Your raptor strike deals additional damage and grants a bonus to your AC against the attacks of opportunity it provokes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mocking Dance - A bard can provoke an enemy to attack him in the next round, but the enemy gains a damage bonus for each attack made against him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raptor Strike - A single attack that deals additional fire damage and can knock enemies prone, but provokes an attack of opportunity both before and after damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slapstick - When an enemy misses you with an attack of opportunity, it provokes an attack of opportunity. The opposite is also true.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Squirrel Logic - You may immediately move 5 feet directly away from an enemy once per day in response to provoking an attack of opportunity with your movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sucker Punch - Deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage whenever you successfully feint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Utterly Confuse - You can make a Bluff skill check to confuse an enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, Actually... - When somebody near you makes Knowledge check, make an opposed check. If you win, reduce the result of the skill check made by the other individual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wizard Duelist - Challenge an arcane spellcaster to a duel! The first individual to break the rules of the duel loses his ability to cast for 1d4 rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
