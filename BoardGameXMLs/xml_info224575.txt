							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Officers of Rank: Mass Combat Commanders</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recruit Armies to your Cause!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oftentimes, fantasy stories culminate in large-scale battles involving enormous armies, cunning generals, and masterful tactics. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s The Lord of the Rings, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, or one of countless other beloved stories, mass combat dominates the most dramatic scenes of fantasy stories. Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Ultimate Campaign features some pretty good rules for handling mass combat in a fun and fast-paced way that doesn&amp;rsquo;t bog things down too much, but while there is plenty of room for additional support and options for these rules, they haven&amp;rsquo;t received much in the way of an expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents five new NPC commanders that your PCs can encounter, either to hire them as allies, or to face them down on the field of battle. Each commander comes with a traditional stat-block, as well as stat-blocks for one or two armies under their command. Each also has several new boons and flaws, unique to each commander, which can be used with the commanders presented here or made available to be mixed and matched with other boons to create other interesting commanders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
