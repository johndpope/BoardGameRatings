			<description>ULTRA STARFIRE is the fifth edition of the Starfire game system. Continuing improvements on the basic Starfire combat system, Ultra Starfire is comprised of two parts: the tactical combat system and the campaign system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tactical combat system is a fast-paced fleet-level war game of starship combat, still using the same simple combat system designed back in 1976. The campaign system is an empire-level economic war game where the player starts with an alien race on a single world and attempts to conquer the galaxy. Battles from the campaign system are played-out using the tactical system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultra Starfire is a partial rewrite to Galactic Starfire, Fourth edition. Ultra Starfire was designed for completely balanced game play in a player versus player competitive environment. While it could still be used for story-based games, the appendixes and additional material was designed for shorter competitive campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultra Starfire was the first all-electronic product from the SDS, sold as a set of cross-linked PDF files, but still used the counters and map sets from Galactic Starfire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Galactic Starfire&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
