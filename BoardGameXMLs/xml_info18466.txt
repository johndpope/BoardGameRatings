			<description>Monopoly with computer properties. However, there are a good number of differences. Board has a path across the center that you move on if you roll either even or odd. Also upgrades to your software come in the form of computer magazine awards which you receive from drawing cards (ie chance and community chest cards)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also it isn't just &amp;quot;pass go collect $200&amp;quot; the more programs you own the more you collect, also you collect payments from the bank when competitors land on your space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One other interesting feature is that you can stage a hostile takeover and claim a piece of software from someone if you draw the right card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game ends when someone gets to 1 billion dollars cash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The company's one, and as far as I can tell only, press release:&lt;br/&gt;SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 25, 1995--Yes! Your Expression Solution !nc. proudly announces the release of TechnoTycoon(TM), the fun and exciting board game where the object is to become a BILLionaire(TM).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the last decade the software industry has created more millionaires and billionaires than any other industry. Microsoft alone has created the world's richest individual as well as a few other billionaires and several thousand millionaires. Now, with TechnoTycoon it's your turn....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You begin with $50 million. As you play, you acquire various software products by paying their development cost, hoping the return in sales amasses you a fortune of over a billion dollars. TechnoTycoon's software products are parodies of best-selling software and include familiar names like WinDoze, Fun-2-3, WordPurrrrfect, Cyberpunk-In-A-Box, HardWork Graphics and 30 others....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the players move around the board, they receive sales when other players land on their software. If your software wins awards from computer magazines such as PC Geek, MacAbuser, WinDoze Magazine...sales skyrocket. And if you're fortunate enough to own a software suite, sales are more lucrative for each suite member.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can cruise the Information Super Highway to faster upgrades and a better chance at becoming a BILLionaire. But watch out for hostile takeovers, the Justice Department, and greedy lawyers. Advertising, taxes and new versions are costs which should be avoided. TechnoTycoon is a game that will be enjoyed by nerds and non-nerds alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The price of TechnoTycoon is $29.95 (Washington residents add sales tax of $2.46). TechnoTycoon is only available directly from YES! Your Expression Solution. To order, call 800/U-BUY-FUN (800/828-9386) or send check or money order to YES!, P.O. Box 5753, Kent, WA 98064-5753.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONTACT: YES! Your Expression Solution !nc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brad Stowell or Ted Crane, 206/439-7581&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
