			<description>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay fanzine containing a convention scenario. The scenario was designed for running at tournaments to support WFRP and Hogshead (then publishers of the game). A low-fantasy adventure with a clever twist. Includes pre-generated characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the inside cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This adventure was written as an adventure for use at conventions in order to offer existing WFRP players a scenario and to introduce others to the wonder that is WFRP. It is presented here in its final form, as it underwent some evolution after feedback from players.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
