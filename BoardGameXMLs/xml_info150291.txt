			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple he-thinks-that-I-think card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have a set of cards numbered 1&amp;ndash;6, where 6 is the king and 1 is a simple pawn. The back of each card is the Pariah, which is zero.&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players roll a die each and may play face down any card of that number or lower. All turned face up, and you count number of wins. The King wins over all cards except the fool (2), all other cards win over the fool. If a player has played a card higher than the number he rolled, he cannot turn the card, and it's a Pariah, which loses to all. Each win is awarded 1 point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every card has a special power, that usually affects his ability to play next turn. For example, the Pariah allows the player to not roll the die, but choose die result for the next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is repeated for 5 rounds, which counts as one hand. The player with most points after three hands wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
