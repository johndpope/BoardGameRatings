							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zambies: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>2-6 Players build up defenses and toss Zambies around as weapons. Turn all your enemies into Zambie Bosses and be the last Player alive to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple game, quick to learn and quick to play. The more people you can get to play the more crazy the game becomes. The game revolves around drawing cards that consist of Zambies and Defenses. You use these cards to turn the game in your favor by blocking incoming Zambies, building up your enemies Zambies pools and once maxed, turning them into Zambies Bosses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game doesn't end when you lose, Oh no, there is much more. When your Zambie pool is maxed out at 15, you collect the Zambies in your pool, and now you get to throw those Zambies at other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zambies is a fast paced card game and can take 5 - 30 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
