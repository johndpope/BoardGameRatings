			<description>Army Men: Sarge's Heroes is an action-shooter video game that was released for Windows, Nintendo 64, Dreamcast, and PlayStation. It is part of the Army Men series of video games based on the plastic toy soldiers. It was preceded by Army Men 3D and succeeded by Army Men: Sarge's Heroes 2. The player normally controls Sarge, a Sergeant in the Green Army and fights evil General Plastro and the members of the Tan Army. Both armies are named after the usual colors of toy army men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single Player&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two modes for single player: Campaign and Boot Camp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Campaign is the main mode of Sarge's Heroes. The player plays as Sarge, the protagonist for many of the Army Men games. The player travels through several missions, completing objectives, killing enemies, destroying vehicles, and rescuing people. The plot starts out as the Tan Army is invading the Green Army base. Sarge rescues Colonel Grimm and they evacuate the base in a helicopter. In the game, Sarge discovers portals that lead from the &amp;quot;plastic world&amp;quot; to the &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot;. The Tan Army is getting &amp;quot;Weapons of Mass Destruction&amp;quot; from the &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot; (toys and ordinary objects, i.e. magnifying glass). Throughout the game, Sarge rescues commandos of his own unit, Bravo Company. Sometimes they are in Tan bases, and other times he has to go through portals and save them from the &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot;. To avoid the destruction of the Green Army, Sarge must destroy the portals and stop Plastro.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boot Camp is a training level, based on the actual United States Marine Corps Recruit Training. Boot Camp consists of training areas for all weapons, an obstacle course, and a &amp;quot;live fire course&amp;quot; in which Sarge is shot at.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiplayer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2-4 player multiplayer (only 2 players in the Playstation and PC), players choose their character, faction, and difficulty. Players then select a map. The players fight each other until the number of preset required kills to win is reached.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Army Men: Sarge's Heroes&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
