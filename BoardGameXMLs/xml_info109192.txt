			<description>Game Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1944-1945 Armored combat in Western Europe.&lt;br/&gt;The M4 Sherman and the M18 Hellcat. The Tigers of the Reich. These tanks rocked Europe from D-Day to the fall of Berlin. Inside one of these steel beasts, you'll feel the same gut-wrenching tension World War II tank commanders experienced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is real heavy metal!&lt;br/&gt;Command your combined armed forces as they fight over the expanses of a World War II battlefield. Or, jump into any tank for a first person, close range firefight where the action is fast and deadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're in charge!&lt;br/&gt;Control a single platoon, a company or an entire battalion with complete operational command. Become part of legendary units like the American 4th, 7th or 10th Armored Divisions- or the German 11th, 166th or Panzer Lehr Divisions. You choose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hell of wheels!&lt;br/&gt;Startling 3-D graphics and detailed in-tank controls bring these armored juggernauts to life. An advanced topographical system lets you experience every jarring shock as you smash across Western Europe's war-torn landscape. Follow your unit in historically accurate combat scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special bonus CD!&lt;br/&gt;The Across The Rhine Windows video is more than 40 minutes of archival film footage and maps that take you through the great armored battles following the D-Day invasion. Created by award-winning documentary producer Lou Reda, the video adds an interactive, multimedia presentation that punctuates the game's historic authenticity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Complete operational command of a tank platoon, a company, or an entire battalion.&lt;br/&gt;    * Choose which side you'll fight on and the tanks to fight in.&lt;br/&gt;    * Pull-down menus and point-and-click functions make battle tactics easy.&lt;br/&gt;    * Historically accurate World War II tank combat scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Primary technical consultant, Albin F. Irzyk, Brigadier General USA (Ret.); Commanding Officer 8th Tank Battalion, 4th Armored Division during World War II, part of General George S. Patton's 3rd Army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
