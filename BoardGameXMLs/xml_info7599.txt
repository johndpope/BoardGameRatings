			<description>From game box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your quest is about to begin. Think you'd make a good secret agent?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Put your spy tactics to the test. In SpyQuest(TM), you'll watch one of three action-packed espionage adventure movies on your own VCR. Each of these half-hour long Hollywood-quality motion pictures was produced exclusively for SpyQuest(TM) and bridges the gap between live-action adventure and you, the player. Next, you'll be traveling the world uncovering clues to a secret location. Sound easy? Not so fast. You'll have to decipher the configuration of a key, tooth by tooth. You'll be interrogated about your knowledge of the film as you compete against other agents on the same mission. They'll use road blocks, naval mines, spy scopes, and sabotage kits against you to reach the location first. Of course, you can use the same tactics on them, so anything goes! Be the first agent to uncover the secret location, travel there, and survive a triple interrogation and you're proven secret agent material. With five sets of interrogation questions and 64 different secret location possibilities, you'll have a new and different adventure every time you play. Good luck and may the best spy win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
