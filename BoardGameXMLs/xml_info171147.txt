							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yakkaz</name>
									
			<description>Yakkaz is not available to purchase, being the third in a series of specially commissioned welcome gifts for visitors to Le Grand Massif ski resort in Haute-Savoie, France. The previous games in the series were ZOU in 2012 (an adaptation of Mow) and Kizz-Kizz in 2013 (an adaptation of Okiya).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yakkaz is similar to Yahtzee, but instead of regular dice, five sides have images of the Tootizz, guardians of Le Grand Massif (see the Tootizz story).  The sixth side has an image of Zhinzho the dragon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, players roll the dice up to three times and mark one (or optionally two) results on a score sheet. If more than one Zhinzho is rolled, they can be used to improve an already marked score; each line can be improved only once. The highest score at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
