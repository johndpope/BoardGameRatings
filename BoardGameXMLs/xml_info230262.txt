							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Time&#039;s Up! Party Edition</name>
									
			<description>Based on the popular game Time's Up!, Party Edition challenges players to guess the names of famous people and titles of films and videogames among others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to get other players to guess the same set of titles over three rounds. In each round, one member of a team tries to get his teammates to guess as many titles as possible in 30 seconds. In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed. In round 2 no more than one word can be used in each clue. In round 3, no words are allowed at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This edition is not to be confused with Time's Up! Edici&amp;oacute;n Amarilla. Both editions have very similar yellow boxes but Time's Up! Edici&amp;oacute;n Amarilla has only famous people while Time's Up! Party Edition has famous people mixed with various famous titles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
