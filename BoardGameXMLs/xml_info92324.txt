							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eternal Legend</name>
									
			<description>You are an Eternal Legend, a warrior who has the ability to take on at least a hundred men and survive.  A hero who has fought many battles and come back with trophies, gold and many tales to tell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such heroes and heroines of adventure and wonder travel the land to seek their own destiny and fortune. Yet there is only one true way to gain such fame and that is on the field of battle.  Any hero can go down into a dark dungeon or save a maiden from a tower, but it takes a true hero to fight alongside fellow men and outshine every one of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eternal Legend is a  hack and slash adventure where you play one hero or heroine who has to cleave their way through years of war in order for their name to go down in history. Every turn a card is drawn and the player can choose to fight in that war or pass it by. If they pass they begin to fade into obscurity but if they succeed the Hero gains more riches and fame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the years go on the world gets harsher, new wars are fought and less is understood. Can your hero survive all eight eras of battle or will their name go down in just a few sections of history?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play one hero or compete for fame with friends as you cleave your way war by war, becoming the victor or dying a (hopefully) heroic death. The objective is to claim fame in as many wars as possible and amount the largest pile of gold and riches before your inevitable defeat.  Everyone dies someday, so why not go out in a shower of bloody but heroic glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
