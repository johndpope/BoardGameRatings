			<description>Mortal Online is a First Person, open-world, Player versus Player MMORPG by the Swedish video game company Star Vault released on June 9, 2010. The game is inspired by the desire to return to Ultima Online's player-controlled, sandbox-style game design; it uses Unreal Engine 3 by Epic Games and features a skill-based, action-style combat system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mortal Online does not have a traditional level/class system, but rather a skill and attribute system similar to the Elder Scrolls series. There are 10 different races for the player to choose from and players can have Three characters per account, but all characters on a specific account share a soul called a Deva which binds the actions of all characters together. Finally, Mortal Online features a non-repeating history designed to dramatically enhance the game's persistent world realism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mortal Online&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
