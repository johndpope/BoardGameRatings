							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Silver Isle</name>
									
			<description>Each player represents a nation of Europe seeking wealth from a newly discovered island during the age of colonial expansion: England, Pirate Confederation, Spain or France. After forming the isle, players move colonist crews (coins) across the isle on foot, or around the coast by sea in a ship (pawn). Crews exploring new land on foot claim new property for their port (null tile), may establish a mine (die), and fight enemy colonists. After a mine is established, crews may mine the site and transport silver (tokens) to their colony or their ship. The ship may transport silver and/or crews around the coast of the isle and to Europe (off board).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silver Isle is played with a Piecepack set and the rules can be found on the Piecepack Wiki.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Piecepack Game System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
