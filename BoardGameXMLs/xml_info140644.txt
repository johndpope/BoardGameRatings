			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kill had been so damn easy. Satisfying, but too easy. Didn&amp;rsquo;t take enough time with it though-should have savored the moment more. What have I just done? How could I do it? None of it seemed real-not really real. It was like watching me in a movie. Tracking the target had been no problem at all-the red-headed cow had barely even looked behind her. Her idea of making her trail hard to follow was changing cabs a couple of times. Cripes, where do they get their agents these days? Did I just dream the whole thing? Have I suffered some kind of episode? That leather duster jacket I wore&amp;hellip;taking the rifle out from underneath the coast, putting it together&amp;hellip;that awful pause before that woman fell to the floor after I squeezed the trigger&amp;hellip; This six page PDF is an easy-to-integrate PC class and just the sort of thing needed for GMs to add depth to any great d20 Modern campaign world and gaming session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
