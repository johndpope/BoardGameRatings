			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;Famous game show, the board game formula has seen many versions for several decades. This is one of the first versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board represents a path of squares alternately white and black. The game includes two sets of cards, vowels and consonants, and 6 special cards representing each side of a dice.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to complete 3 laps of the course by forming the longest words possible. The first player draws 7 letters by choosing the convenience vowels or consonants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has 1 minute 30 to form a word that has spread before him, if a player can form a longer word, it announces and shape. Whoever has the longest word advance his pawn on the course as many spaces as there are letters forming the word. Maps of the word are removed from the game The next player must keep the other letters and return to pick the missing cards to replenish his hand to 7 letters. If nobody finds a word, 7 letters are rejected and the tour resumed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the course, when a player lands on a black square, he rolls the dice, takes the letter corresponding to the figure obtained (this letter can be A, E, I, O, U or S) and must reform a word of the same number of letters in the word presentation of the current lap. If it fails, it returns to the box where it came from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
