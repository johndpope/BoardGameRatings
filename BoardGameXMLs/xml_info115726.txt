			<description>From the game Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A game about Bull Riding? Really? Yep.&lt;br/&gt;8 Seconds from Glory is a fun little game that's made for having a good time with friends, family and everyone in between. It's a game with a little luck (drawing the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; Bull) and a little skill (knowing when to use your Ride Dice). But it's mostly about fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you play it week in and week out? Probably not but you'll be able to pull it out occasionally and play without learning how to  play all over again. It's simple. It's fun. You remember fun right? That's why you play games&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8 Seconds from Glory is a very little and easy game that uses the simple throw of 2 dices to adjudicate the many situations the bull rider will face during his brief cavalcade. The result of the dice is confronted with compiled tables that will tell players the outcome of the phases, the dice is no way a blind roll. Every rider (and even the bulls!) have their characteristic and their traits, so a sparkle of role-playing game is gladly implemented, as are rules to make your rider or bull progress during rodeo seasons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very fun to play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
