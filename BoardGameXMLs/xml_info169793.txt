			<description>In this roll-and-move minigame, players start in Europe and have to roll dice to sail their ships around Africa and Asia to reach Japan. On each turn, the active player may choose to either 1) roll the dice, or 2) pass. If the player rolls the dice, they choose 1 result and place a chip on that die spot. If there is already a chip there, they cannot choose that rolled die number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A) If the chosen rolled die shows 2-6, that is the player's movement value. Move the pawn forward; each step costs as much as the number in the space being moved to. Repeat until you cannot move further. B) If the chosen die shows 1, the player's next movement value will be doubled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After finishing A or B, return to choosing 1 or 2 again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to reach Japan!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    2 six-sided dice and player pawns are needed but not included with this postcard game. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
