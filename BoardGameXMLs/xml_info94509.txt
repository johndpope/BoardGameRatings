							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Return of Heracles</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An amazing game from the makers of Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves, correcting the mistakes of the former game and adding several pleasant advancements, this is the definitive game of Greek Mythology.  Take control of any or all of some thirty legends of Greek history--from the titular Heracles to Asclepius the physician.  Loosely patterned on the 12 labors of Heracles, your characters must travel throughout the Hellenic world, fighting monsters, solving puzzles and pleasing the Gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In format, it's a top-down RPG.  Points are awarded for completing labors; bonuses are awarded for minimizing lives lost and time spent.  Out of a theoretical maximum of 10,000, 9,500 is a good score and 9,650 barely conceivable (although a certain kind of play once netted 9,756!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters start out with statistics based on the gamewriter's interpretation of the character.  The include speed, strength and agility as well as hit points.  These attributes can be modified by the purchase or other acquiring of arms and armor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
