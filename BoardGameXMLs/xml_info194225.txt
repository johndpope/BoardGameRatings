							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eon Contract</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wanted criminal has turned an undersea museum into an armed fortress, and you've been hired to take part in the siege. At his disposal are hostages, a mercenary army, a mountain of credits, and a profound desire to live. You have your wits, your equipment, and the full fury of the Fractal Shores IRPF office to help you. Tough enough, if all is what it seems. But there's a third faction with a stake in this standoff, and they didn't bother checking in their assets...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eon is an IRPF contract for parties of any size, centered around themes of suspense, combat, and suspicion. It is recommended for players who are familiar with the HSD universe. All you need to use it are a copy of the HC SVNT DRACONES rulebook and a copy of the Core:Extended combat addendum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This contract runs best if the Guide has read it, but the players have not! For player convienience, printing has been enabled on this title. However, the images in this .pdf have not been optimized for print, and will be a little fuzzy on paper. For sharp, crisp images and vibrant color on a printed page, purchase the print version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
