			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future.

The end of the world. A rugged coast, a free people. Anabaptists and their chapels, as far as the eye can see. Wheat is in full bloom and peace hangs over the land like a benevolent veil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The influence of Souffrance is but a distant echo. It is a place defined by its legends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But whosoever wipes away the dust of the story, quickly discovers that underneath a web of unhealed scars lays hidden. An invisible threat is on shore leave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For five hundred years it has been waiting, relentlessly biding its time, snaking along the coastline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the moment has come and it can finally leave the water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains the truth about northwest Franka, the sixth Chakra, as well as the machinations of the Marauders . It offers new possibilities for seasoned players to unravel the mystery of Jehammed's will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chapter &amp;quot;STARFIRE&amp;quot; introduces Briton's epic history, describing the country, its people and their conflict with the Primer spawn. It also provides the scene and starting point for the present story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;BURNT IDOLS&amp;quot; unleashes the destructive forces hidden in Briton and sheds light on the dramatic events unfolding in the background. The adventure &amp;quot;BLACK ATLANTIC&amp;quot; sends players on a merciless odyssey through Briton, where they are confronted with dangers of past, present and future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;THROWN TO THE GODS&amp;quot; provides a brilliant end to the campaign and details what is to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BLACK ATLANTIC combines the strengths of a regional sourcebook with a variety of background information for a scenario that can instantly be played. It lays the foundation for one-of-a-kind gaming sessions on the northwest coast of Franka. At the same time it ties up loose ends of previous narratives and foreshadows approaching events in the world of DEGENESIS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
