			<description>A Two-Round Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are all part of a &amp;ldquo;gang&amp;rdquo; of orphans and misfits who have decided that you would not sit back and let the world have its way with you any longer. You all want to make something of yourselves, and have begun to take the first steps necessary to walk that path. The kinder people of the City of Waterdeep call your gang &amp;ldquo;The Waterdeep Boy&amp;rsquo;s Club&amp;rdquo; but you prefer to call yourselves the Order of the Hydra. You aren&amp;rsquo;t the only gang in the City, but you are at least looked upon with a little respect. A number of your members have made an honorable name for themselves in the past, and you and your compatriots want to follow in their footsteps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is why you are here today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
