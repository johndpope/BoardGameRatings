							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Balloon Tycoon</name>
									
			<description>Balloons make people happy, and making people happy can make a fella rich.  So naturally you want more balloons! ... But there&amp;rsquo;s a string attached (actually many strings) ... because so does everyone else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Balloon Tycoon players try to build collections of balloons (by linking similar coloured balloons together) to fulfill a particular game winning goal ... but beware! ... that goal can change at any moment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is simple. On your turn you take a card and then you play a card. But what card will you play?  Will you play a Balloon Card to build up your collection? Will you play an Action Card to wreak havoc on your opponents? Or will you play a Goal Card so you can win?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just remember, what goes around comes around! And other players can win with your Goal just as easily as you can!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
