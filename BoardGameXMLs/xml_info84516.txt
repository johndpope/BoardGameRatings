			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs are thrown into this adventure when their travels in the earldom of Oswick are noticed by the current lord, Morvekai Oswick. Morvekai sees the presence of brave adventurers in his lands as a fine excuse to throw a party, and invites the characters to his castle as guests of honor at a grand banquet. During the feast, the ghost of Ralnon Oswick appears, groaning in low tones, moving slowly and silently across the stone floor. The party degenerates into panicked chaos, and Morvekai begs the PCs to stay on and solve the mystery of the ghost's appearance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters may be of any race or class, though a dwarf would be particularly appropriate and a cleric with the ability to channel positive energy would be extremely helpful. &amp;quot;Foul Deeds Rise&amp;quot; can be easily integrated into any campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
