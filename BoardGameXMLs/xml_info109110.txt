			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is designed to be an action/endurance module for &amp;quot;The Babylon Project&amp;quot; role playing system. The module will see the Player Characters abducted and taken to the Narn homeworld by covert Narn forces, looking for telepaths. It is intended for Player Characters to make some friends along the way, team-up, break out and free the remaining prisoners &amp;hellip; then somehow escape from the Narn homeworld. This adventure requires a group that:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Has at least one (1) telepath as a regular Player Character &amp;ndash; this is a must!&lt;br/&gt;     Can use lethal force if a situation proves it necessary.&lt;br/&gt;     Preferably doesn&amp;rsquo;t have too many Centauri in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These points are important as they allow the adventure to run smoothly: a party of Centauri diplomats, none of who are telepaths (but they are all good drinkers!) would not be kidnapped by Narns looking for telepaths &amp;ndash; killed, maybe &amp;ndash; but not kidnapped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
