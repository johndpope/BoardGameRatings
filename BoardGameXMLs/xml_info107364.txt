							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle Arena Toshinden 3</name>
									
			<description>Battle Arena Toshinden 3 for PlayStation is a 3D weapons-based fighting game and sequel of Battle Arena Toshinden 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toshinden 3 is the first of the main series not to be ported to other platforms. It is also the only game in the series that has game play differences between the Japanese version and subsequent US and European releases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whereas Toshinden 2 was largely built upon the first game, Toshinden 3 radically changes the series' gameplay. Most notably the arenas are now enclosed, allowing players to launch opponents into the walls and ceilings in order to juggle them with further attacks. The combo system has also been reworked, with every character possessing a preset list of combos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as the 14 starting fighters, the game also adds a huge 18 unlockable fighters bringing the total to 32, though most of them are largely mirror images of the original 14's fighting styles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Toshinden 3&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
