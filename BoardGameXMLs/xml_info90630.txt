			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MotoGP: Ultimate Racing Technology 3 is the third title in the Xbox and PC branch of the MotoGP series. It is based on the 2004 MotoGP season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;URT 3 features all 16 tracks from the 2004 Grand Prix, as well as all the riders and bikes from the championship. There are four levels of difficulty for both main game modes, and the control-affecting weather conditions have been carried from the previous titles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grand Prix still allows players to customize a rider and match skills against computer-controlled opponents, but new to the series is Extreme Mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extreme Mode places the player in a fictional street racing league with parallels to the MotoGP. There are 16 new bikes featured in Extreme Mode, including 600cc 2-strokes, 1000cc 4-strokes, and 1600cc 4-strokes. Succeeding in races will earn cash that can be used to buy new parts or bikes for future races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can compete in 4 player split-screen local play, or up to 16 player online races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
