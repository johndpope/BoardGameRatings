			<description>Pardoners&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your sins cry to me from the depths of your Shadow. Yield to me, and I will grant you absolution and healing. If you resist, I will still aid you. It's just going to hurt a lot more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Puppeteers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hiya, bunky. Guess what? Ypu're a passenger in your own body right now, so sit back and enjoy the ride. I've been watching you for a while, and it's pathetic. Si I think it's time that this dead man showed you how to live. Hope your credit cards aren't maxed out, 'cause we're gonna need 'em.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's Getting Crowded in Here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Puppeteers: renegades who challenges Charon's Law every time they practice their powers of possession. The Pardoners: confessors and healers of the Dead, but they harbor a terrible secret. Both groups work toward what they see as the ultimate good for the Underworld - but would any other wraith agree if he knew what these Guilds are hiding?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guildbook: puppeteers and Pardoners is the fifth in the continuing series of Guildbooks for Wraith: The Oblivion. The first Guildbook to contain two Guils under one cover, Puppeteers and Pardoners includes everything - new Arcanos Arts, Merits, Flaws, Artifacts, Histories and more - that you need to play a fully realized member of either of these Guilds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guildbook: Puppeteers and Pardoners contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The real reason the Puppeteers turn the Risen loose upon the world&lt;br/&gt;     The hidden link between the Pardoners and Charon's destruction&lt;br/&gt;     New uses for Puppetry and Castigation, and much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
