			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2001, Super Mario Bros. 2 received another enhanced remake as part of Super Mario Advance (which also contained a remake of Mario Bros.). Super Mario Advance was developed by Nintendo R&amp;amp;D2, and was the first Mario title for the Game Boy Advance. The Super Mario Advance version of Super Mario Bros. 2 includes several new features such as the addition of the enemy Robirdo (a robotic Birdo acting as the boss of world three), the addition of the Yoshi Challenge (in which players may revisit stages to search for Yoshi eggs), and an all-new point-scoring system (a first for the game). Graphical and audio enhancements were also added in the form of enlarged sprites, multiple hit combos, digital voice acting, and such minor stylistic and aesthetic changes as an altered default health-meter level, boss-order, backgrounds, the size of hearts, Princess Toadstool being renamed to the now-standard &amp;quot;Princess Peach,&amp;quot; and the inclusion of a chime to announce starmen were also added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
