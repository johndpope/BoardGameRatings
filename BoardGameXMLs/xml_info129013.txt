			<description>Deluxe Series #6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following on the success of No Retreat! where the Russian Front of World War II beckons, and then taking the action to the African Front, game designer Carl Paradis and his trusty developer Alan Emrich have teamed up yet again to present the third chapter in this game series, No Retreat 3: The French Front.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Phony War&amp;rdquo; ended in May of 1940 as the German Army unleashed blitzkrieg attacks into Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg in preparation for their audacious plan to invade France. Dubbed &amp;ldquo;Case Yellow&amp;rdquo; (Fall Gelb), it relied on a surprise attack with armored forces through the Ardennes Forest that the French had deemed impenetrable. A German staff study proved otherwise, and their panzers were pushed through this broken wooded terrain with deft speed, catching the Allies by surprise with their appearance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In No Retreat 3, players command the Allied (French and British) or German forces, operating them in accordance to one of several historical plans (represented by Plan cards). Maneuvering forces over hexes that are approximately 30 kilometers across, over turns that represent 4 days of real time each, the vaunted No Retreat series card-assisted game systems are there to create on-map puzzles around each hex, unit and battle as the tense engagements rage back-and-forth and nothing is entirely predictable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer Carl Paradis has made an exhaustive study to answer the question, &amp;ldquo;Could France have staved off total defeat in 1940?&amp;rdquo; His research yields a resounding, &amp;ldquo;Yes!,&amp;rdquo; and the simulation elements of No Retreat 3, combined with its novel gameplay elements, offer a rich and insightful presentation of this controversial military campaign that shaped the trajectory of World War II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Data:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complexity: 5 on a 9 scale&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Suitability: 3 on a 9 scale&lt;br/&gt;Scale: Each unit is one army: The German forces or the Allied forces (French, British, and Neutrals) Each hex is about 30 kilometers from side to side. Each turn represents four days of real time, except the first turn, which is only two days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Full-color, 24-page rules book&lt;br/&gt;     8.5&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot; Player Aid Mat&lt;br/&gt;     2 two-sided 8.5&amp;quot; x 5.5&amp;quot; Player Aid sheets (1 German and 1 French)&lt;br/&gt;     11&amp;quot; x 17&amp;quot; game map&lt;br/&gt;     117 thick, two-sided, multi-shaped game pieces&lt;br/&gt;     37 Event and Plan cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
