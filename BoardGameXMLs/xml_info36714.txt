			<description>In a small town, the farmers have to collect as many eggs as possible to feed their families. But in order to get the eggs, they must have a good memory. The have to memorize both the location of the nest and the colour underneath each look-alike hen. Playable in two levels of difficulty for both beginner and advanced players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the classic memory card game, players are not looking for matching pairs. In this game, hens occupy nests but must always be returned to a different nest once their colour has been checked. Hence, the eight hens are always moving around the nine nest positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also unlike traditional memory, the hens are not collected as the game progresses so there is not a simple endgame. Instead players collect the coloured eggs as a record of hens correctly found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
