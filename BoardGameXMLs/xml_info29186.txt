							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chap Acquitted</name>
									
			<description>Listed in American Games, #4210.  1979, Social Concern, Board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 'game' certainly published with a steep agenda.  This game references Senator Ted Kennedy's incident in July 1969 where he drove off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island, into a pond.  While Kennedy managed to swim to safety, his passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne drowned.  Kennedy left the scene of the accident and was later given a suspended sentence of 2 months in jail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Senator Kennedy (in reference to this incident) has sometimes been referred to as a 'Chap Acquitted'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 'game' appears to challenge the acquittal and cast an unfavorable shadow on Ted Kennedy.  The box cover refers to it as a 'Bridge game of sorts' and included a 273 page book entitled - Teddy Bare, the real story of Chappaquiddick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
