			<description>Taken from the the game's official web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tangram Fury&amp;rdquo; is a competitive and amazingly addictive table-top game based on the ancient Chinese puzzle known as a &amp;ldquo;tangram.&amp;rdquo;  Players attempt to be the first to recreate images using the seven pieces of a standard tangram puzzle. Fun for everyone! Tangram Fury can be played individually, or in teams, with as few as two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players compete against each other to be the first to build tangram puzzles shown on cards. The first player done, wins the card. The first player to earn five cards, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tangram Fury has two levels of play: &amp;ldquo;Fan&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Expert&amp;rdquo;. The Fan level is easier, because the shapes on the cards have borders that show how each of the seven tangram pieces fit together to form the shape. The Expert level only shows a silhouette of the shape and players must figure out which pieces go where.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes four categories of tangram images: people, animals, fish &amp;amp; birds, and objects &amp;amp; shapes. Each category is represented by colored cards. Rolling a multi-colored die determines the categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
