			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Titan is an extremely dangerous place. Mankind and its allies huddle in fortified settlements, for beyond the castle walls the wild lands stretch across three continents. Out in the wastelands, Orc tribes war with each other for dominance. Savage monsters roam at will in search of food. Evil sorcerers ready their inhuman armies for battle. No one, surely, would venture out into such inhospitable places - unless the rewards were so great a hero couldn't possibly refuse!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Allansia is the third volume in the Advanced Fighting Fantasy series, and within its pages you will find rules for designing and running adventures in the savage lands of Titan. In Dungeoneer you ventured into the deadly underground realms in search of treasure. In Blacksand! you dared enter the crime-ridden cities and towns. Now it is time for YOU to explore the wilderness, in search of the greatest rewards of all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
