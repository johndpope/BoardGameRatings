			<description>The dungeon goes through the ground.&lt;br/&gt;It's also very famous in the world as the treasure&amp;quot;God bless&amp;quot;.  Anybody said the &amp;quot;God bless&amp;quot; was placed on the most deep floor, and any monsters lived in the dungeon. It's many and many.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, in this world, the monsters live anywhere without cities and towns. The people sometimes has a battle with them. But the monsters in the dungeon are different with other monsters. Because anyone can't see the &amp;quot;God bless&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So the people was interested in &amp;quot;God bless&amp;quot; and the dungeon. At first, it's mercenaries and ventures. But a few years ago, the nobles are interested in them.&lt;br/&gt;The nobles hire the mercenaries and ventures and so on, and they pay the cost to the mercenaries and ventures, they take any treasure in the dungeon. Of course, their target is &amp;quot;God bless&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player is one of the nobles. They hire the mercenaries and ventures and so on, and take the any treasure and a honor as stars. The stars means the noble can go to more deep floor. It's a honor to other nobles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with most stars is a winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
