			<description>Twelve Men's Morris is a traditional board game similar to Nine Men's Morris. It was most popular during the Middle Ages when it was played in courts across Europe.  It is played on a board with 24 nodes joined by lines; each player has twelve pieces. The game proceeds in three phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Players alternately place one piece on a node in each move. If a player makes three in a row, he or she can capture one of the opponent's pieces.&lt;br/&gt;     Once all the pieces are placed, players take turns moving the pieces to adjacent nodes. Again, whenever a player forms three in a row, one of the opponent's pieces may be captured.&lt;br/&gt;     When one player is down to just three pieces, the remaining pieces may &amp;quot;fly&amp;quot; to anywhere on the board (not just adjacent nodes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You win when you reduce your opponent to two pieces, or when he or she can't move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two possible boards exist.&lt;br/&gt;One has three concentric squares marked with the mid-points of the adjacent sides of the the squares linked and also the adjacent corners linked. This is known as &amp;quot;small board Twelve Men's Morris&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other board has four concentric squares marked, and similar to Nine Men's Morris, has only the mid-points of the adjacent sides of the the squares linked. This is known as &amp;quot;large board Twelve Men's Morris&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
