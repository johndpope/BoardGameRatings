			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've always been the best of friends. You've done practically everything together. But this past summer, you all went to different camps and started getting interested in different things. And when you went back to school, things were different between you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you always loved Halloween, and you all knew you'd go trick-or-treating together. So on Halloween night, you all met on the street corner...but one of you wasn't there. You all raced to this friend's house...and it's been replaced by a spooky mansion. It's like your friend never existed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will now face monsters and villains as you race to get your friend back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
