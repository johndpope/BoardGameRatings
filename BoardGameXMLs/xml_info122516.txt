			<description>Logical deduction game. Each player starts with a grid of 7 x 7 squares. Both boards must be hidden from the opponent. One player (the Target) marks his starting point in the centre square of the grid. The other player (the Shadow) starts at any one of the four corner squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective for the Target is to visit two of the four corner squares without being captured. The objective of the Shadow is to capture the Target by landing on the corresponding square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Target moves orthagonally and must keep a record of his moves by tracing a line from his start point through all the squares he travels over during the game. The Shadow moves like a Knight in Chess. Information is given each turn to enable both players to get some idea where the other is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
