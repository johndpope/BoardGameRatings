							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Crown of Stone, Chapter 3</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the land of Ramulia was known as R&amp;uacute;mil, a great and powerful elven nation. But after a terrible earthquake split the country in two the survivors slowly abandoned it, unable to cope with the losses and the unending tremors that plague it even today. The King of R&amp;uacute;mil survived the disaster but became a broken man and wasted away the last of his years reminiscing about his past glory in a drugged stupor. His son, Prince Voronw&amp;euml; Merilairon, vowed to rebuild R&amp;uacute;mil at any cost. He joined the Copper Kings, a rebel organization dedicated to returning rightful heirs to their thrones from their usurpers, and used their resources to ensure no one else claimed Ramulia until he could. But over the last 200 years all of Voronw&amp;euml;&amp;rsquo;s attempts to settle or take control of Ramulia have failed and so now he prepares one last gambit to restore his ancient kingdom and his family&amp;rsquo;s prestige.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
