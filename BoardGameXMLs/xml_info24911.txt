			<description>Olivia challenges convention, requiring those around her to make the occasional leap of faith! Playing cards feature the numbers 1-10.  A 42 card deck is divided evenly among the players.  The idea is to bid a hand of matching numbers and place the cards face down on the table.  Announce your numbers, for example, &amp;quot;two 2's.&amp;quot;  A player may doubt your bid by saying &amp;quot;Olivia Doubt's It!&amp;quot;  The player who is challenged must reveal their hand, have the match or pick up all the cards on the table.  If the challenger is incorrect, she must pick up all of the cards.  The first player to put down all of her cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- Text from box.  Apostrophe in game title is printed on box title, box description, and rules cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
