							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Occupation of the Rhineland</name>
									
			<description>The tiniest of games I have seen, I think this one is smaller than Panzerpranks?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 hexes one counter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is for the Germans to occupy the Rhineland just prior to WWII. A die must be provided by the players. The sequence is pretty simple, the German player attempts to enter the hexes of the Rhineland. Rolling on a chart to see if his move is successful. The French player does nothing.  With a bad roll a French 75 goes off accidentally stopping the &lt;br/&gt;German Move. The German wins if he enters all hexes of the Rhineland, the French player wins if he does SOMETHING!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tounge in cheek, simple effective rules, I do see that it needs a little errata though.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
