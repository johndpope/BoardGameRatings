			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Line Attack Heroes is a fast-paced action brawler available for download as Wiiware. The game premise involves defeating enemies to add their power to your attacks. The player controls a cartoony character that travels through levels battling a number of different villains. As these baddies are defeated they are added to the player&amp;rsquo;s line and provide additional offensive might. With larger lines the player can perform stronger attacks, and a wider range of advanced maneuvers. Special enemies and bosses will provide special attacks when defeated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features a story mode which can be played solo or cooperatively with up to four people, as well as a handful of battle modes for competitive matches. The levels are bright and colourful, and have a complement of interesting settings including a kabuki theatre and an oversized toyland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
