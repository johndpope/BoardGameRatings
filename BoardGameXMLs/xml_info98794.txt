			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alien Invasion!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While exploring a far-off region of the cosmos, your best friend's starship was ambushed by hostile aliens from a remote galaxy. These hostile aliens have informed Earth that they are sending a crack intergalactic invasion force, the Planet Smashers, to take over your planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You know that with a name like the Planet Smashers these guys are not going to leap at a chance to vacation in Geneva and talk peace. These vicious aliens murdered your friend, they intend to pillage your planet and enslave your fellow&lt;br/&gt;humans. Besides, they're really ugly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can't wait to take your starship out to meet these ill-begotten space cadets. You can't allow even one Planet Smasher to reach the Earth!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planet Smashers is an exciting vertical scrolling space shooter. You must expertly maneuver your ship to avoid deadly alien fire. Blast away with speed and accuracy to destroy seven waves of mutant invaders before they get a chance to destroy the Earth! While you do battle with these vicious creatures in their home galaxies, the Earth will have more time to build shields against alien attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Begin by commanding the first of your four sleek starships. Without shields, each starship will be destroyed by only one hit from enemy fire, or one collision with an alien craft. Learn to dodge quickly and to protect your starship! The game ends after your last starship is destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Score points for each alien starship you destroy. Shoot alien cargo vessels to release valuable items. Move underneath released items to pick them up and upgrade your ship. Be careful! Some released items are destroyed if you shoot &lt;br/&gt;them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll need the Warp Capsule to speed on to the end of the current galaxy in your fight to keep the alien horde from reaching Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After surviving regular alien attacks, you must destroy the alien leader of each galaxy. The leaders are tough to destroy, and have killer attack abilities. Your final encounter will be with the dictator of the Planet Smashers, a nasty video game alien who will put your most horrible nightmares to shame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
