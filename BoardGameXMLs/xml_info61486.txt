			<description>From the introductions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MAGICAL BATTALIONS is a rule system for fantasy miniature battles.  It assigns figures factors by a process of measurement and judgment to reflect the capabilities depicted by the pieces themselves.  Figures are moved as individuals; no special stands or formations are required.  Play takes place on boards comprised of hexagons or squares; a list of terrain features and effects is provided.  The system is best suited for skirmishes involving 10 to 200 figures.  Any number of players can participate either as teams or in a free-for-all.  There is no need for referees.  The length of play and the area needed for play depend on the number of figures and players involved; a battle between two players' armies of 50 figures apiece would easily fit on a card table and probably last 2 to 4 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
