			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a roleplaying game system designed for creating characters in the setting of Equestria from My Little Pony: Friendship is magic. It's an attempt to create an original system that focuses on a diverse set of abilities rather than simply on combat, as many roleplaying games do. It also uses mechanics that are made to replicate circumstances from the show, particularly the secondary stats as the Elements of Harmony. What this book is not, however, is a guide to the setting. Many resources exist to help GMs and players understand the setting of the series, and to put them in this book would almost certainly violate the creators' intellectual property rights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is not meant to be all-inclusive, nor is anything meant to be concrete. A GM's judgement overrides the rules in this book, though they should do their best to stick to what's presented here in terms of stats and how to use them. The rules of this game should be easier for experienced pencil and paper roleplayers to grasp, but I've done my best to present it in a manner that makes it easy to understand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play this game, you will need at least one set of polyhedral dice, including a 4-sided die, a 6-sided die, an 8-sided die, a 10-sided die, and a 12-sided die. You will also need a more experienced player to serve as the Gamemaster or GM, a sort of narrarator who helps the other players tell their stories by presenting them with various obstacles and helping to determine the outcomes of their actions. In a game like this, while there may be individual contests with specific winners, there are no real &amp;quot;losers&amp;quot;, and everyone is a winner as long as fun is had.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
