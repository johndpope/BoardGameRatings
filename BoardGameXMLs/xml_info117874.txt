							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grand Cam</name>
									
			<description>Grand Cam is a four-player analog of the game Cam. This is a partnership pure abstract game. Partners sit next to each other. To win, one player has to move a piece into the goal opposite his pieces' starting position or all the losing partnership's pieces must be captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This has the marked differences in play between Camelot and Cam combined with two pairs of immediate opponents whose pieces generally move in directions orthogonal to each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design of the Grand Cam piece setup and the design and construction of the first Grand Cam game board in 2005 owe themselves to WCF member Paul Bramwell Smith, who is deservedly acknowledged as the game's inventor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grand Cam is different than Grand Camelot in the following ways:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The Grand Cam board has 93 squares.  The Grand Camelot board has 180 squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Each side in Grand Cam has two Knights and five Men.  Each side in Grand Camelot has four Knights and eight Men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
