			<description>Played in rounds, the winner is the player with the lowest score after 5 rounds of play. Players are dealt 10 cards. A player starts by playing as many &amp;quot;one&amp;quot; cards as they have been dealt (or bluffing and laying down cards of a different number). The next player layers down as many &amp;quot;two&amp;quot; cards as they have and play continues in this fashion until players either run out of cards in their hand my card manipulation, lying about their discards, challenging other players about their discards or using the specialty cards, like skip, throw the die and reverse cards which greatly manipulate the round of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
