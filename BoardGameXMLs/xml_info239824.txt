							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 (And More) Medieval English Surnames</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beginning in around the 12th century, and following the Norman Conquest, surnames started appearing in English language. These early surnames tended to have actual meanings when they were first used, being related to things such as where a person lived, nicknames and their profession. They were also based on a number of different sources. These then started being passed onto their children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement provides a list of 100 different medieval English surnames, with many more possible variations as the initial spelling of surnames was more than a little variable, that can be used in a medieval English setting or, indeed, later ones up to the present day or even beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The names are provided with notes on their meaning and origin, as well as alternatives, if these are known. A brief suffix table provides a number of suffixes which may be added onto other words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is an example from the table:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Name: Archer Notes: Occupational, from the Middle English archere which is from the French L'archer meaning bowman. Alternatives: Archar, Archere, Arsher, Arshire, Larchier, le Archer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page of the supplement is the cover, one and a bit the introduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
