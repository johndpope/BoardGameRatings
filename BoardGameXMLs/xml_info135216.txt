			<description>The game is about taking over a dartboard that is divided into hexagons. Different hexagons give each player unique advantages. Taking over hexagons is done by either throwing darts. The player who picks the best strategy to take over the board and has superior dart throwing skills wins the game. Also included in the gameplay are playing cards and moving armies and tower. The towers are huge pushpins that physically block darts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
