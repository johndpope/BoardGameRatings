							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sesame Street Picture Hunt</name>
									
			<description>In this children's matching game players race to match all the cards of their color to items on their boards. Each player receives 2 boards depicting a Sesame Street scene with lots of characters and items. The item cards are mixed and placed face down within easy reach of both players. At the count of 3, each player simultaneously turns over a card. If the card's color is the same as the player's boards the player looks for the location of the item, shouts &amp;quot;I found it!&amp;quot; once discovered, and places it in a card space on the board's top. Players return cards that belong to an opponent. The first player to fill all eight card spaces on both of his or her game boards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
