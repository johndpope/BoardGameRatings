							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Panzer Grenadier: Horse Soldiers</name>
									
			<description>From the Avalanche Press website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horse Soldiers introduces the U.S. Army's 1st Cavalry Division, in its mounted version, to Panzer Grenadier. The division would eventually be dismounted and sent to the Pacific without its horses, but in the war's early days some of the cavalry generals hoped that their horsemen might ride into action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Army at Dawn covers the battles of the other two First Divisions - the 1st Infantry Division and the 1st Armored Division. The 1st Cavalry Division did not accompany them to North Africa; the U.S. Army had prepared itself to provide fuel and maintenance for thousands of vehicles, but not the fodder and care for large numbers of horses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We're not limited by that harsh reality; in Horse Soldiers the American cavalry rides one more time. Horse Soldiers includes two dozen new, laser-cut playing pieces showing the 1st Cavalry Division troopers in their own special livery, plus a couple of scenarios for their use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
