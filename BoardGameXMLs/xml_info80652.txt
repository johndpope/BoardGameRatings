							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slalom</name>
									
			<description>Slalom is a skiing video game made by Rare Ltd. for the NES. It was released first in the United States in August 1987; a European release followed on October 15, 1987. This game bears the distinction of being Rare's very first console video game (though they had created a variety of previous games for home computers such as the ZX Spectrum). Rare would go on to achieve widespread fame for the creation of the Donkey Kong Country series of games. The arcade version, Vs. Slalom had the player stand on a grey platform with embossed skis with which the player controlled the game, although not all units were set up this way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Slalom (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
