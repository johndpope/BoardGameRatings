			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the archives of the BlackHammer Project comes the new state of the art in projectile weapon systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the third volume of BlackHammer Firearms - detailing a selection of military &amp;amp; paramilitary firearms that are outgrowths and adaptations of existing designs - extrapolated to the edge of the Progress Level 5 / 6 boundary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The firearms in this document are illustrated, fully described (with full history, d20 statistics and descriptions of who uses them and why), and ready for use in a modern / future d20 campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although IMI stopped manufacturing the venerable and ubiquitous Uzi in 2016, other companies are still producing licensed copies... other gunsmiths are taking the old Uzi, however, and rebuilding it as a state-of-the-art submachine gun. Five different models of the SwanSong Armory Uzi retrofits are detailed - including the Uzi Support pictured above, with the attached 30mm grenade launcher - two models are illustrated. A Chechen reduced assault rifle, based almost entirely on the classic M-16, the Insurgent is designed for close-quarter and house-to-house fighting common in urban engagements. The weapon is very short overall, and is treated more as a large submachine gun than as an assault rifle. Heckler &amp;amp; Koch is one of the most famous manufacturers of military personal firearms in the modern age. The MP10 'slimline' subguns were developped concurrently with the BMP-9 series (below) and the UMP submachine guns. The MP10 line features a lower profile than the earlier MP-5s and UMPs and is available in a variety of calibers and two basic models. In all, 6 models of the MP10 series are described and detailed in this product, along with two illustrations. The Heckler &amp;amp; Koch BMP-9 takes the classic MP-5 line and mates it with a helical magazine, allowing for extended autofire (or 'combat endurance'). Although somewhat awkward in weight and handling, the design allows for a 42-round box magazine to be used without significantly increasing the total height of the gun. 21 models of the BMP9 series are described and detailed, along with three illustrations. The descendant of the Druganov SVD, one of the world's most famous sniper rifles, the Druganov PIR (Product Improved Rifle) is the new standard marksman rifle for the Russian military (in the classic 7.62x54mm chambering of the SVD) and Ministry of Internal Affairs (in the 9mmx39mm SP-6 chambering). In addition, a variety of export models are in production. 6 models of the PIR are described and detailed, along with an illustration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
