							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Missing Mythic Magic Volume VII</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uncover Forgotten Arcane Lore!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone knows that knowledge is power, and that having options is better than not having them. It should come as no surprise, then, that wizards, witches, and other powerful spellcasters are always on the lookout for new and exciting spells to add to their repertoires. While many spells from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook received a facelift and an upgrade in Mythic Adventures, the sourcebook that introduced mythic power to the game of Pathfinder, dozens of spells were left behind. Missing Mythic Magic Volume I, and its successors, aim to give each and every spell from the core rules a full-fledged mythic upgrade, all the way from A to Z, with a special focus on making mythic spells that feel as over-the-top and larger-than-life as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This installment includes 18 mythic spells, from detect secret doors to disrupting weapon. Why settle for merely dispelling your opponents&amp;rsquo; spells, when you can use mythic greater dispel magic to actually siphon off their power, increasing the potency of your spells based on what you dispel. Or use mythic dismissal to automatically banish summoned creatures (no save), or even &amp;ldquo;banish&amp;rdquo; non-extraplanar creatures back to the location of their birth. Those with deception in their hearts will find no end of uses for mythic disguise self, which can not only allow you to take on the form of creatures of any type, and even appear to be notably larger or smaller, but also lets you duplicate tactile and auditory elements, while those who want to uncover the truth will be equally well-served by mythic discern lies, which denies non-mythic creatures a saving throw, and reveals when someone withholds information, as well as when they give false information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
