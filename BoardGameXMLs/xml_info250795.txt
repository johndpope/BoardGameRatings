			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arise, Children of the Night!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Living Dead.  Nosferatu.  Children of the Night.  No matter what you call them, the true name rings out across the ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vampires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are the rules for Vampires in The Victory System.  How they are created, how they exist, and what it takes to take one down... or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Focused on the Near-Modern Era of Play, this book also details the society of the Earth of 2025 and how Vampires fit into it alongside demons, aliens, and dozens of other influences that shape the Destiny of the world.  Includes information on Vampires as enemies, allies, patrons, and even as Player Characters.  New Merits, new Flaws, and new Powers flesh out the monsters of old with some new twists!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are notes on Vampires in other Eras of Play, sample Vampire characters, and ideas on quickly introducing Vampires into your Victory System campaigns.  Nothing gets the party started like a few well-placed Vampires!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
