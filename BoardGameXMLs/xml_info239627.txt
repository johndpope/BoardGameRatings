			<description>Textura &amp;ndash; Telling (Hi)stories is an attempt  to develop a game for history lessons which, due to its modular structure, can be used with numerous historical themes in different grades. The game offers an approach to promoting the narrative competence of pupils in history education while also deepening their content knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Textura consists of a collection of square tiles divided into 2 categories: &amp;ldquo;Content cards&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Connection cards&amp;rdquo;. Content cards display the period-specific content of the history lesson. The connection cards consist of a set of images and symbols that can be used with all historical periods. They can take on different meanings depending on the context and interpretation of the symbol. The players use them flexibly in order to tell history and develop connections between the content cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are different gameplays for Textura, it can be played in cooperative or competitive mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
