							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">New Corruption Manifestations Volume II</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be Your Own Kind of Monster!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corruptions, from Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Horror Adventures, give players a new way to indulge their dark fantasies and take the role of gothic monsters, infecting themselves with some taint or darkness, and presenting the tantalizing question of whether to struggle against the corruption, or embrace it, and allow themselves to bask, however briefly, in its dark power. While Horror Adventures presents between nine and ten different manifestations for each corruption, this leaves high-level victims of corruption with limited choices in what manifestations to take.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents five new manifestations, complete with new gifts and new stains, for the lich, lycanthrope, possessed, promethean, and shadowbound corruptions, for a total of 25 new manifestations. With this book, you can:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Consume the souls of your enemies.&lt;br/&gt;    Unleash primal howls that panic your prey.&lt;br/&gt;    Send your own spirit to possess the bodies of others.&lt;br/&gt;    Gain resistance, or even immunity to magic.&lt;br/&gt;    Make enemies bleed from their eyes with just a look.&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;hellip;and much, much more! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
