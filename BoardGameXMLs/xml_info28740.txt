			<description>Djarhun is a world in peril.  The evil wizard Gharad has stolen the Book of Avrakar and has unleashed many creatures throughout the land.  In a desperate hope, the King of Elidor is seeking the help of a few brave adventurers to recover this book and return it to Elidor in the hopes that the City's mage may put an end to the evil that runs amok throughout the land.  Others, of vile morality, seek to take the Book to the Gypsies in a hope of finding its secrets for their own evil purpose.  You are one of these adventurers that seek the Book.  Along the way, you will encounter many perils and much treasure.  You will gain new friends and meet helpful strangers.  When you are strong enough, you will travel to the Abyss, where you will fight Gharad in a battle that may decide the fate of Djarhun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Djarhun is a fantasy board game that can be played by up to 6 players.  As players move around the board, they will find items, and slay monsters, that will increase their power.  When a player is powerful enough, they may head for the center of the board and try to claim the Book of Avrakar.  Whoever brings the Book to the predetermined location, is the victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expanded by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Ruined Urthe: A Djarhun Expansion&lt;br/&gt;     Goblin Invasion: A Djarhun Expansion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
