							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Just Another Bug Hunt</name>
									
			<description>Taken from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Is this going to be a stand-up fight, sir, or another bug hunt&amp;quot; - Hudson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules are inspired by the films Aliens (tm). They can be played solo as the Aliens are all generated by dice rolls. Two possible games can be played:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) The players are Colonial Marines who are exploring a base where a group of colonists have settled. Earth has lost all contact with the colonists. The marines are sent to check the base out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) The Colonial Marines are planet side defending a group of settlements where contact has been made with the bugs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further scenarios may be created too if preferred, use the films for ideas. Any scale of figure will do from 10mm to 25mm, a collection of D6 are required. Measurements used are by squares if using floor plans otherwise substitute inches for squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;System makes use of standard action point allowance.  Players control colonial marines in a randomly generated hulk.  Aliens are either game master controlled or on auto-pilot (they are after all perfect killing machines).  Lots of room for back story and role-playing aspects, in fact the game probably plays better in this fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
