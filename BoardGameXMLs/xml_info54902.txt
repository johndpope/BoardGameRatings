							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Queen of Air and Darkness</name>
									
			<description>The Queen of Air and Darkness is the third adventure in the Dawn of Defiance campaign, which will take heroes from 1st level all the way through 20th level in a continuous storyline designed to give both players and Gamemasters a complete Star Wars Roleplaying Game Saga Edition experience. This adventure lets the players take part in the famous Cloud City Sabacc Tournament (the same tournament in which, years later, Han Solo will win the Millennium Falcon from Lando Calrissian) and the heroes should advance to 7th level by the end of the adventure. Over the course of this adventure, the heroes will discover that there is more to this tournament than is apparent on the surface, and that it is being used to cover a transaction between Darga the Hutt and the evil Galactic Empire. This adventure is the final part of the story arc that makes up the first chapter in the Dawn of Defiance campaign. After the adventure, the heroes should have some much-needed downtime. (From Adventure Introduction)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
