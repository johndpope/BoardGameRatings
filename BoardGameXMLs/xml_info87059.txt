			<description>User Summary: Game Chef 2010 Design Contest Submission&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the wasteland of the USA after nuclear war has devastated the cohesion of the country and scarred the land. What was once lush, green farmland is now dead desert, and people struggle for survival in a place with no laws, and few resources. A group of wanderers comes together to the remnants of a town, and looks to start rebuilding from there -- but they will have to face threats to their newfound community, both external and internal, as everyone alive has secrets and no one will risk their survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The essential gameplay of Last Chance, USA is the relationships between characters in times of stress when all of their essential life needs are being threatened both by friends and enemies. Treachery should run rampant and loyalties should be tested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting inspirations include The Road Warrior, The Colony, Book of Eli, The Seven Samurai, and other stories of Post-Apocalyptic survival. Interactivity inspirations include a variety of Reality TV shows and the methods they use to induce chaos into these temporary communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
