			<description>Chemaction is a game of chemical compounds.  Scrabble-like tiles have elements on them along with the number of bonds that element may form.  Players hold seven tiles and draw back to seven at the end of their turn.  Players must play compounds from their hand to the board, building off of an already placed element.  Basically, it's Scrabble but laying chemical compounds instead of words.  The board is a plain square grid, without any bonus squares.  Blank tiles are also included and can represent any element.  There's a bonus for using all your tiles in one turn.  (The game was published by Borg-Warner Chemicals, so there's also a bonus for playing any of their phosphate compounds.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
