			<description>Modern Naval Rules for the 21st Century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules have been designed to give players an accurate, yet manageable game in a 2-3 hour playing time. In these rules, combat occurs in three distinct zones. &lt;br/&gt;(1) Within the horizon.&lt;br/&gt;(2) Over the horizon and&lt;br/&gt;(3) Underwater.&lt;br/&gt;The horizon has a nominal range of up to 24 inches, while beyond the horizon is limited to 48 inches or the average width of a gaming table. Most torpedo attack ranges are limited to 12 inches, although some torpedoes can operate beyond the horizon. The game system allows for a movement rate of 8&amp;rdquo; per game turn for all vessels and unlimited for aircraft. This gives a reasonable appearance of movement for 1:3000 scale ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules are intended for ships in the 1200th /3000th or 6000th scale. All dice are D6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
