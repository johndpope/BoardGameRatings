							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">There are Monsters! in this Book</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let's say that one day you're traveling along. Well, not you, specifically -- your character. We'll name him Doug the Destroyer of Worlds. Ol' Doug there is traveling along the road when out of nowhere he's attacked. Is it bandits? Is it dwarves? Is it bandit-dwarves?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No! It's a cyclops! What do you do? No, really. What do you do? Cyclopes weren't covered in &lt;u&gt;There's a Game in this Book&lt;/u&gt;, and now you have no idea how they're supposed to play. Fear not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
