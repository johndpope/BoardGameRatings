			<description>The gang bosses have met to divide up the town. Tempers turn and the talk turns nasty... It's a gang war!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gangs have their instructions on a secret card and so they set off round the streets to take over two of the four city rackets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unoccupied property is taken over without a fight, but if a rival gangster has already taken it over and stayed in defense, it means risking a 'hit'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who knows the outcome of a duel with this hilarious armory? When a gang member initiates a hit on another player, they each draw a hit card add its number to your dice roll (one dice for each gang member and the Boss gets two dice), add up your score. The losing gang member(s) are 'hit' and no longer participate in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gangs collect tokens from the food, drink, gambling and money rackets in their headquarters to show the other gangs who is the boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gang that survives to run the two sets of rackets on their objective cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
