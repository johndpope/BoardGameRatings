			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Climb effortlessly through the ranks of the Rebel Alliance with Star Wars: Age of Rebellion Specialization Decks! Created via FFG's in-house manufacturing, Age of Rebellion Specialization Decks each come with twenty talent cards for a single specialization, so you can keep the text of your character's abilities at your fingertips. Spend less time consulting your blueprints and more time updating Rebel tech, blowing up Imperial shield generators, and convincing the galaxy's citizens to join the fight for freedom! The Empire's main weapon, more effective than all of the incredible firepower at its disposal, is fear. Fear lets it maintain order and authority over the countless beings in its thrall. Accordingly, Agitators are tasked with helping others overcome that fear, replacing it with anger, courage, or a sense of righteousness - anything that inspires them to rise up, take up arms, reject the tyrannical government that has long oppressed them, and help restore freedom and justice to the galaxy. As an Agitator, your job requires that you tread carefully, and you'll do well to keep track of all your resources with the Diplomat Agitator Specialization Deck. This is not a standalone product. A copy of the Star Wars: Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook is required to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
