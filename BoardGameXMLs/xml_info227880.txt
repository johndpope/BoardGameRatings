			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you be the Archmage&amp;rsquo;s favourite by conjuring the most powerful mythical creatures? Use their unique abilities to bolster your magical powers or hinder your enemies in this game of luck, strategy, magic, and creatures of legend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ember: Mage Nights sees a reprint of the wizard playing cards (in order for Ember to be a complete and playable game once more) and also includes thirteen Spell cards that offer even more replayability. With all new luck-mitigating rules and ever more game-play additions, this may be the final expansion for Ember, but for the players, the quest is only just beginning!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WIZARD CARDS: The Wizard Cards are a reprint of the original core game Wizard cards in a brand new box. These cards are completely reworked to make them crystal clear and to remove any of the vagaries that surrounded some of the original cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE SPELLS: Mage Nights contains thirteen brand new spell cards that go in the Draw Deck and allow you to either use those powers as wild cards in conjuring, or to perform spells like the mighty Fireball, or to heal damage done to your creatures with Cure Light Wounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
