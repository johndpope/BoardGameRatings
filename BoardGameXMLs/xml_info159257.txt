							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alluria Campaign Setting Guide (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get the best of all worlds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not a stand-alone campaign setting&amp;mdash;it is a setting upon which material from your entire library of campaign settings can be applied. The Alluria Campaign Setting Guide works as a framework upon which eclectic Game Masters can build a widely diverse world. It provides a backdrop in which multiple worlds intermingle, characters that would not normally interact do, and culture is no longer a barrier. Best of all, it ties in all of the unique and wonderful creatures of Alluria Publishing&amp;rsquo;s Remarkable Races line with all of the most popular core races. So if you want a fun and interesting way to explain why your party&amp;rsquo;s android alchemist, drow ninja, and entobian ranger happen to be adventuring together, pick up the Alluria Campaign Setting Guide today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: This is the 5th anniversary edition of this tome. The Alluria Campaign Setting was our flagship product, mostly abandoned after we decided to focus on the Pathfinder Roleplaying System and the Cerulean Seas setting. For our five year anniversary, our first tome has been updated from its original with a conversion from 4th Edition Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game system. However, the original formatting was preserved to demonstrate how far Alluria Publishing has come in the last half-decade. While the content and art are still top notch, the format and layout are quite primitive by our current publishing standards, but still very enjoyable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
