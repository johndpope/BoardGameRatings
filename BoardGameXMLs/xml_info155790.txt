							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Japanese: The Game – Business Expansion</name>
									
			<description>This 36-card Business Expansion Deck brings you vocabulary appropriate to the office and business transactions. Words like &amp;ldquo;Profit,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Office,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Co-worker,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Commute,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Boss&amp;rdquo; are included along with a mix of particles and other words that allow these cards to integrate into a Core Deck without any loss of play balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each expansion to Japanese: The Game adds new vocabulary words, and thus the rules that go along with how each noun, verb, or particle can be placed to make a sentence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion decks are shuffled in with the main deck to accommodate more players (the game plays 2 by itself and needs either an additional core deck or an expansion to accommodate more), or just to add less common words to the mix for 1-2 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
