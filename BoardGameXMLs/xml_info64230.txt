			<description>Across the Board is designed for kindergarten, first, and second grade students. Across the Board can be used in a classroom, with a teacher or older student monitoring play, or can be played at home. In a school setting, it is recommended more than one game board be used to accommodate more than four players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design of Across the Board permits it to be used again and again! Each game changes with the shuffle of the cards and the placement of the pieces&amp;mdash;there are several paths Across the Board.&lt;br/&gt;Through active play, children learn directional vocabulary (forward, backwards, right, left, over, under) they will apply daily.&lt;br/&gt;This game have two versions: adults/kids&lt;br/&gt;In the kids version the aim of the game is to get to the other side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;In the adult version the version is to be the first to get there!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
