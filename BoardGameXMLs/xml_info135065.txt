			<description>Microbadge:  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle of the Bulge, by award-winning designer John Butterfield, is a classic wargame: tense, turn-based, and faithful to history, with rich graphics and an elegant interface. Game play is quick but strategically deep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game simulates Hitler&amp;rsquo;s last gamble: an offensive to crack the Allied lines in December, 1944. A surprise attack, countered by a desperate defense, culminates in bold counterstrokes. Pieces represent actual military units fighting on the terrain of the famous World War II battle. &lt;br/&gt;Bulge was designed specifically for iPad. Easy gestures allow players to see the whole battlefield or focus on single units. Turns are short, so you don&amp;rsquo;t need a lot of time. Battles are never certain, but careful planning pays off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play how you want, when you want. Mobile gamers can play on their own against cunning computer opponents, online with friends, or &amp;ldquo;pass the pad&amp;rdquo; face-to-face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fast sprint -- and a satisfying campaign. A quick scenario takes players through the opening assault in only a half hour; the full campaign shows the ebb and flow of battle and each side&amp;rsquo;s rich strategic choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn while playing. Historical commentary sets the stage, describing the situation, generals, and weaponry. Day-by-day narratives let you compare your battle to history.&lt;br/&gt;Comprehensive system. A tutorial, full rules, and online forums help players learn to play and to explore the game&amp;rsquo;s subtleties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First of a series. Games using the same rules, beginning with El Alamein, covering the decisive battle in North Africa, are in development for 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle of the Bulge first drew attention through a Kickstarter campaign in May, 2012. Eleven hundred fans backed the project, raising twice the amount requested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Veteran game designer Eric Lee Smith founded Shenandoah Studio to publish top quality strategy games on iPad, in the spirit of classic board games. Shenandoah&amp;rsquo;s team of designers, developers, and artists collectively bring 160 years of experience to the enterprise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: [&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.shenandoah-studio.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.shenandoah-studio.com&lt;/a&gt; The Developer Press Kit].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
