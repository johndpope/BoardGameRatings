							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Palace Gardens</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surrounded by the rest of the palace gardens stands this ensemble of bushes, gravel paths and a marble fountain. Not as complicated as a real labyrinth there are still many different paths from the outside to the fountain at the center. Thus it provides entertainment and at least a small amount of privacy. Especially on hot summer days the bushes lining the paths provide some much needed shade, as do the larger trees growing around the semi labyrinth. And the fountain at the center provides refreshingly cool water channeled there through underground pipes. As the bushes are evergreens they would even provide a wonderful contrast to the show during winter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
