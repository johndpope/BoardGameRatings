			<description>A Two-Round Adventure for Six Paladins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round One: To Kill a Lich&lt;br/&gt;Round Two: To Catch a Lich&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A grim morning and a difficult quest. That is what you face today. Your friend, student, master, and father, Markus Trueheart the Good, has fallen to evil. He has become a creature of undeath, a horrid lich.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Markus has been a leader and an inspiration to the city of Montague for two decades or more. His work for charity, his unceasing fight against evil, his kind and wonderful manner, all are missed. Now, the love has turned to hate in many hearts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Markus set out with his Squire Mendrick to seek out the truth about a ritual only hinted at in the oldest books of the temples. It was to have boosted a man's ability to work for good tenfold, while allowing him eternity to carry on the fight against evil. However something about the ritual was wrong, for when Markus completed it he disappeared from Mendrick's sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His next appearance was in Montague, where he raided the wizard's guild. He did so with fireball after fireball. Only a lich could have rained such destruction on a town. The fires he set spread to the nearby hospital. Many were badly burned, and some died.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus, with the wounded cared for, your thoughts turn to justice. Markus must pay for his evil deeds. He must be stopped, for who knows where he will strike again. And finally, he must be stopped for his own sake. Markus was a good man, one who does not deserve the torment of eternal evil. You owe it to him as his friends to end the unlife he has been inflicted with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have little to go on about his current location. Squire Mendrick can lead you back to the ruins where the ritual was performed. While a worthy fighter, the squire may have missed some clues that together you may find. The ruins are but two days ride to the south, along the coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You currently sit in the office of the high priest of the temple of Tyr, Vanir. He is not present, but is letting his second in command, Sir Artur Hieronomous, use it to plan your mission. Your steeds are ready outside, and some of you wished to be underway already. Only the insistence of Colonel Dunstan that you plan your mission properly has kept you here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
