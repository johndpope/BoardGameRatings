			<description>Hero Team Quest is a co-op game designed for young children.  Very few board games that kids are exposed to emphasize cooperation and team success.  With Hero Team Quest, all the players compete together and the outcome of victory or defeat is shared by all players.  The goal is to defeat the wizard before time runs out (when the goblin gives the crystal of magic to him).  The goblin moves 2 spaces on the board every round, closer to the end.  Players must get to the end and defeat the wizard before he gets there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players first form a hero team of four characters and each may obtain a magic power at the magic school - each power is a weakness of one of the four bosses in the game.  As they move across the board, they look to avoid losing a turn by stepping in mud.  Players stop on the battle spaces to roll the dice to defeat the various bosses.  Certain powers will make the chance of success better for some characters.  If you should lose, you go to the cage where you must roll a 1 on your turn to pick the lock.  Otherwise, other players may come to your rescue if they should defeat the boss OR they can decide to continue on the path if time is of the essence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game does offer some choices and teamwork/communication, but is ultimately a simple game designed for young kids that is easy to follow.  From a complexity standpoint, it's a step up from games such as Candyland, Chutes and Ladders, Sorry, etc. - but in a genre that most kids enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
