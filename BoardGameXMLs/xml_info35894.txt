							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeon Crawl</name>
									
			<description>After building the dungeon, players move their characters (pawns) around the dungeon seeking treasure (crown coins). Monstrous denizens (moon coins) and deadly traps (sun coins) pose hazards which may cause damage (value-up coins in players' holdings), but defeating these challenges earns experience useful for later encounters (suit-up coins in players' holdings). Players may also attack each other in an attempt to steal treasure or equipment (arms coins). Once the final treasure has been found, the game ends,and the player with the highest total value in treasure wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules can be found on the Piecepack Wiki.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Piecepack Game System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
