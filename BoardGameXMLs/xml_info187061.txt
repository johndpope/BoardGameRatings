							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bellwether: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>After the great Madstone war your village must be rebuilt. You will be an important part of that.  You are a wizard!  You must learn new spells to accomplish this.  With them you will hunt dark creatures and restore the town's resources and buildings to their former glory!&lt;br/&gt;In Bellwether, the card game, each player starts with five cards in hand. There are two ways to gain points: The first is to build buildings and societal organizations.  The second is to hunt dark creatures. All cards have a magical energy (color of the boarder of the card), a magical artifact, a creature to hunt, and civilization advance or building to build.  When a player chooses a study action all players gain more cards--the player choosing the action gains an extra card.  When a player chooses to hunt dark creatures he uses the magical artifact on a card or combination of cards to target the creature on a card in his hand or the top of the discard pile. Again all players have the opportunity to hunt, the player choosing the action gets bonus damage.  When a player chooses to build he chooses a combination of cards from his hand or from creatures previously killed, the player choosing to build gaining a bonus.&lt;br/&gt;Points are also gained by having a variety of different types of creatures killed and buildings built.  If a wizard builds or kills all of the same order, he becomes obsessed and loses points for being a dark wizard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
