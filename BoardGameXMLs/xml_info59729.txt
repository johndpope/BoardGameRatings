			<description>User Summary: Free pdf introduction to the Hunter: the Vigil rpg using White Wolf's SAS system. Includes introduction, basic mechanics and a starter adventure &amp;quot;The Hunt.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Vigil Starts Here&lt;br/&gt;Like most people, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably had the sense- at least once- that things are not right with the world and not everything is as it seems. You&amp;rsquo;ve felt that sinister truths hide behind a fa&amp;ccedil;ade of normality, veiled partially by the rational, orderly &amp;quot;natural laws&amp;quot; we call science. And when night falls, when the shadows grow long and the wind whistles through the trees, you shudder and remember the truths of your ancestors, who were right to fear the dark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve just entered the World of Darkness, a world very much like our own, save that the shadows hide very real monsters (though most people fool themselves into believing it isn&amp;rsquo;t so).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Hunter: The Vigil, the sixth Storytelling game set in the World of Darkness, you and your friends tell the story of those people who have come to recognize the truth, that monsters exist. These individuals cannot sit idly by. They study their foes. They destroy them or steal their power. They use them as pawns against one another. It&amp;rsquo;s not an easy thing, the endless hunt, the ceaseless Vigil. It is a thing of brutality and obsession, a slope slippery with the blood of those who came and fell before, a slope that descends into nightmare. And yet they can do no differently, because the Vigil drives them. They sacrifice. They push forward. They hunt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This booklet contains everything you and five of your friends will need to play your first game of Hunter, except for some pencils, paper for notes and several 10-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
