							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dumme Dame</name>
									
			<description>Dumme Dame is an abstract 2 player game printed on a postcard. Only a pencil is needed (and an eraser for multiple plays).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing field consists of 4 x 4 spaces. One player starts and writes a number between 1 and 3 into one of the fields and adds an orthogonal or diagonal arrow to the field. The next player follows the arrow and starts his/her player on the target space (the written number is the distance in spaces from the origininal space). Some limitations apply: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     No move may lead over or onto an already used field.&lt;br/&gt;     No move may lead towards an arrow (no back and forth movement). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who cannot make a legal move loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
