			<description>Press Release:&lt;br/&gt;Expected release: July 2010 - Date subject to change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Voltron: Defender of the Universe battle game includes everything two players need to stage epic battles between the forces of Voltron and the Galaxy Alliance and Prince Lotor and his robeast Lo-tron of the fiendish Drule Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes 22 pre-painted plastic figures, including Voltron, 5 Voltron Lions, 5 Galaxy Garrison Cruisers, Lo-Tron, 1 Prince Lotor&amp;rsquo;s Command Ship, 4 Robeasts, and 5 Lo-Tron Force Skull Ships. The game will also include 1 double-sided play mat, 24 specialty dice, 4 status counters, and a full-color rulebook. Completely compatible with all current Monsterpocalypse series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--&lt;br/&gt;Kakaris Maelstrom adds:&lt;br/&gt;Voltron: Defender of the Universe is a standalone game in the Monsterpocalypse game world, targeted at gamers who were hoping to see more &amp;quot;name brand&amp;quot; monsters in the game. The Voltron box offers players an excellent (and complete) way to get into the game but with some characters you're likely already familiar with. The game is also fully compatiable with other Monsterpocalypse miniatures and maps, so you'll no doubt start to see Terra Kahn vs. Voltron and such.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Voltron (and his nemesis Lo-Tron) are morphers, a type of monster whose Alpha form is made up of a series of unit-sized pieces. Voltron is unique in that previous morpher's Alpha forms were made up of 4 units, whereas Voltron and Lo-Tron are both 5 units.  In addition, the battles are fought in space rather than on a traditional Monsterpocalypse city block.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monsterpocalypse is a unexpectedly strategic CMG. Based in the world of kaiju (loosely translated from Japanese as &amp;lsquo;giant monster&amp;rsquo;), you'll control a monster and a legion of support units. You'll vie for control of critical board positions as you try to optimize your die pools. Then unleash your fury against your opponent's monster using a variety of power attacks, destroying a city block or two along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
