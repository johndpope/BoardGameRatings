			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Folk do what they can to scratch out a living in the &amp;rsquo;Verse. Seems like some folk push their luck to scrape by in these tough times. Maggie Miller's bad history and rotten luck are keeping her from achievin&amp;rsquo; her dreams. She wants to get out of the Georgia System to make a fresh start out on the Rim, but she needs three things to do it: a hidden pile of cash, a ship she&amp;rsquo;s hidden with an old flame, Hollis Mason, and enough leftover credits to wipe Ma Millers&amp;rsquo;s medical bills clean before she goes.  The Crew will have to dig for treasure, outwit a wily Alliance officer, and steal a ship hidden in orbit to help Maggie safely on her way. Trouble is, there&amp;rsquo;s a kind of hitch: Hush Jackson, a tough-as-nails bounty hunter who&amp;rsquo;s hopin&amp;rsquo; to cash in on Maggie&amp;rsquo;s head. Will the Crew turn Maggie over for the bounty? Or, will they help Maggie out and pray there is enough cash left over to cover their costs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frieedom Flyer is part of the ECHOES OF WAR roleplaying adventure series, which is centered on a common theme: the Unification War. ECHOES OF WAR adventures include basic rules to get you started employing the Cortex Plus game system. Main characters are found in Serenity Crew, which is available separately. All releases in the ECHOES OF WAR line are compatible with the upcoming FIREFLY ROLE-PLAYING GAME, which is based on the television series by Joss Whedon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
