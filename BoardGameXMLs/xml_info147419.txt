			<description>Roma Celer is a print-and-play express game of political strategy based on The Republic of Rome. The players must cooperate to keep the Roman Republic alive while struggling for dominance within the Roman Senate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Roma Celer, the players share a pool of dice which are used to resolve actions; each player gets to allocate some of the dice, but may be forced to divide them between actions beneficial to the player's faction and actions necessary for the survival of the Republic. The players also distribute among themselves the five high offices of the Republic, and use the corresponding powers to their advantage as well as to hinder the other factions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the end, the faction that rebels to the Senate and wins the resulting civil war, or gains the allegiance of the majority of the Roman senators, wins the game, but only if the Republic is not bankrupt and the Roman people are content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roma Celer uses 54 poker-sized cards and 29 half-sized cards; the players must supply 60-80 euro-cubes or similar objects to be used as markers, and 16-18 six-sided dice. The print-and-play components include counters that can be used instead of the cubes and to reduce the number of physical dice required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roma Celer was originally an entry in the 2013 &quot;In-A-Tin&quot; / &quot;Express&quot; Print-and-Play Design Contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
