							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Eye: Land of Hope</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Eye, a domain renowned for its relative stability and subtle reflections of reality. The Eye is one of the few places in the world where neverite, the only stable element in Nevermore, is both abundant and easily obtainable. Envious eyes are constantly turned towards this domain by greedy mortals and fey alike and this concerns the dreamlords who rule here. Though the streets of their realms are restful for now, they sense the first dark clouds of a gathering storm on the horizon and are quietly preparing for darker time ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nevermore is an ever-changing world where reason fades into myth and imagination. Featured in Green Ronin&amp;rsquo;s True 20 Worlds of Adventure, it offers a plethora of possible and even improbable adventures for those who traverse its strange domains. Nevermore amplifies and accentuates, twists and skews, it is a place where nothing remains the same for long and all who walk its lands, fey or mortal alike, are changed forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
