			<description>It is a game to &amp;quot;discard&amp;quot;, so, the purpose of the game is to finish your cards before your opponents. How? Stay alert and have unbeatable reflexes to catch the opponent in &amp;quot;error&amp;quot;, impose your cards and start driving to the victory.&lt;br/&gt;What each player must do is to draw a card and put it public in the right place. If a player do a mistake and one of the other players see it, he can say Watussy.
