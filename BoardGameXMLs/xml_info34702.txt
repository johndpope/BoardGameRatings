			<description>Monopoly-like game with versions of different cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll two dice. A red die and a white one. Players roll and move their pawns along the local different companies in a city. When a player lands on a company, he/she has to buy the property or pay the owner rent. If a player has a set of companies of the same color the rent rises.&lt;br/&gt;Each turn a player has to take a card based on the roll of the red die. The game ends when one player owns all property.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
