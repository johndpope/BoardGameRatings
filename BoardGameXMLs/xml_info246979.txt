			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player characters will not be the only people around and there will be NPCs as well. Some may be important; others not so much. This is a list of 100 people that could be met in the Wild west, whether this be a historical setting or a Weird West setting, both steampunk and horror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each individual has been given a period appropriate name, sex (with there being 50 men and 50 women), age and occupation given, with perhaps some notes on the individual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The majority of the individuals are in what might be considered prime working age. There is greater variety amongst the females in terms of their profession than might be found in a typical group; all the professions are those done my women but historically there would have been a greater proportion of such as homesteaders and homesteaders wives for example. The people are all assumed to generally of settler rather than native blood; the latter is certainly possible, though, but the names given are European in origin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luetta Newcom - Female, 37 years old, a farmer&amp;rsquo;s wife, she makes and sells candles, soap and butter to supplement their income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the cover and one the front matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
