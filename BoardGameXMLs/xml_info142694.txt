			<description>Mystique Chain is a cardgame played with The Mystique Deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try not to &amp;quot;break&amp;quot; the Mystique Chain by finding cards that share exactly one feature with the card taken before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck is shuffled and 30 randomly chosen cards are placed on the table face up. Then both players draw one of the remaining cards. The card with the lower card number is immediately put to the discard pile, and so are also all the cards not reveald. &lt;br/&gt;The player who drew the card with the higher card number chooses one of the three features of this card (Colour, Suit, Number) and puts the card on the discard pile. (During the first turn, he may not choose a card and a criteria that does not allwo the other player to find a matching card)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then the other player must find a card that shares this feature, but none of the other two features of the card just discarded.&lt;br/&gt;He chooses a card that fits this criterias, names a feature of this card and puts it to the discard pile. The game continues this way as long as players find fitting cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as a player can&amp;acute;t find a fitting card, he loses the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
