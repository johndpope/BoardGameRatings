			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A spectre is haunting the Farm: the spectre of Animalism. The animals of the Farm toil all their lives for the Farmer. The horses give their labor to the Farmer, the cows their milk, the chickens their eggs, the pigs their very flesh. Even in death animals are butchered for the Farmer&amp;rsquo;s table or boiled down for glue and parts. But some animals dream of a different Farm: a paradise where all animals are comrades, where every animal enjoys the fruits of their own toil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General Mud is a game about the animals&amp;rsquo; revolution, and what comes after. The setting is an ordinary farm. It could be in the English countryside, or the American Midwest, or the Ukraine -- obanywhere animals toil for the tables of men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
