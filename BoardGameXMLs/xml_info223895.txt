							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dark Heart</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dark Heart is an introductory adventure to the world of Scath and has everything you need to start playing as soon as possible. The basic rules of Scath are explained in a first chapter, including the handling of combat encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second chapter has the adventure itself, a short scenario for 4-5 characters that will take about four to five hours to finish. It will give both gamemasters and players their first glance into the world of Scath, and what it feels like to be living in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third chapter includes all the important NPCs and  adversaries both human and otherwise that the players might have to face in their search for &amp;quot;The Dark Heart&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fourth chapter finally holds five pregenerated characters, brave heroes to be controlled by the players. Just have your players choose one of these heroes each and you can jump right into the adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dark Heart is designed with at least four heroes in mind, but can be played with less than that if the gamemaster makes some small adaptations or takes control of the remaining heroes as NPCs who accompany the player characters on their journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
