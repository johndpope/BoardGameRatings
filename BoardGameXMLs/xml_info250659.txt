			<description>We are heading to SPIEL 18 this October, please subscribe or follow us on twitter for latest news.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure's Kit: Expedition is a treasure-collecting card game for 2-4 players. The game is designed for younger ones to start with, as it becomes more strategic with aggressive play for adults. In the game, players send out expedition teams to explore ancient continents and collect world famous artifacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up the game, draw ten culture cards, then place them on the appropriate continents on the game board sorted according to their age. Place museums and relics to the side as they are bonuses acquired during the game. Each player starts with five expedition cards in hand; if anyone holds an event card, they should discard it and redraw until they have five cards, after which event cards are shuffled back into the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, draw one expedition card, then choose to either send out the expedition team (i.e., place the specialist cards on the table), replace any number of specialists in hand by redrawing, or explore. You can explore only if you've already established an expedition team. When you explore, see whether the cards played match any of the artifact requirements on the table; the artifacts can be retrieved by consuming certain specialists, and the player can continue exploring the next card in the same continent as long as the requirements match. At the end of your turn, check that all four continents hold at least one artifact; if not, draw ten new culture cards and place them as at the start of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after 5/7/8 museums or relics have been uncovered, depending on whether you have 2/3/4 players in the game. Players then tally their scores from artifacts collected, along with any bonus points they've acquired. Whoever has the highest score wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
