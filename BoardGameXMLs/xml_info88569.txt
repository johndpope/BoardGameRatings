The Flight of Fiends, thought to have once banished thousands of devils and demons from the Flaness, was just a ruse used by Iuz for some unkown purpose. where is the third bishop? Where did the 303 devils go? Why would Iuz betray his own? These questions lead the adventurers into the darkest prison imaginable. Where the most horrid are held until the time of reckoning. There they meet a man with a small child who likes to play with string. A man the boy only calls &amp;quot;Father&amp;quot;. A one-round Living Greyhawk adventure for APLs 6 thru 14. Part Three of the To Serve the Greater Good series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
