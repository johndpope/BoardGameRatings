							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Steel Fort</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a full-color, 62 inch by 30 inch, floor plan of a SciFi Fort, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;We want to steal the brand new VTOL prototype helicopter at the Steel Fort before its first flight test tomorrow. The plan is to knock out their air support and air defenses, and then rappel into The Steel Fort through the roof. From there we will commandeer the VTOL from any marines present, and have our pilot fly us out of there with the prototype craft. You in?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steel Fort is a single map of a well-defended helicopter base. Four 180-degree flak cannons in each of the four corners cover both the ground and immediate airspace. There are six vertical take-off and landing pads (VTOL), allowing additional air support, one of which is currently occupied by a futuristic VTOL helicopter. An armored personnel carrier (APC) hovercraft stands ready for use as additional ground support. Stairs leading down into the Steel Fort underground levels. Some suggestions for maps of this lower level are DramaScape's SciFi Marine Quarters or the lowest level of our The Bunker map. The underground living areas would house the Steel Fort's staff and troops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Steel Fort is intended for use in near and far future science fiction games. It can also be used as a high tech military base in a modern game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Steel Fort works well as the location of an assault or defense scenario on a Mega-Corp or military complex. A covert black-ops mission involving the player characters sneaking into the Steel Fort and carrying out some undetected sabotage, espionage, or assassination is another option. The Steel Fort also makes an excellent headquarters (HQ) for a mercenary or military player character group in a science fiction game, with the helicopter and APC used to transport them to various engagements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure hook for use with this product:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grand Theft Heli/APC: The player characters are contacted by a paramilitary group that wants their help in stealing the new VTOL helicopter prototype and/or the prototype APC hovercraft from the Steel Fort. The group offers to aid in the mission by providing air and ground support. They explain that the Steel Fort has four flak guns and at least four operational helicopters that need to be taken out in order to approach the base. In addition, the Steel Fort is guarded by a contingent of marines which must also be dealt with. Once a strike plan has been agreed upon, an aerial and ground skirmish takes place where the player characters either conduct the assault while their employers steal the craft(s), or vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complications: The targeted prototype craft turns out not to work properly, or it needs to be refueled. The attackers might be forced to try and escape using the other craft present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
