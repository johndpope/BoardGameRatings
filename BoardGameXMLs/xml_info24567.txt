							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Astronomical Tables</name>
									
			<description>Astronomical Tables is a 7 player game from Alphonso the Wise's Book of Games (&amp;quot;Libros del Axedrez, Dados et Tablas&amp;quot;) produced in the late 13th century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Astronomical Tables is a form of Backgammon, played on a heptagon shaped board, each side of which is divided into seven spaces. Each player starts with seven pieces all placed in the first space on their side of the board. Players move their pieces around the board (so a total of 49 spaces on the board) trying to eliminate all their opponents. The player who eliminates the most pieces wins (they are also usually the last player left standing, but not always).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
