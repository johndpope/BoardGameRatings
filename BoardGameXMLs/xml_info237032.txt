			<description>A Three-Round Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your home, the kingdom of Callador, is a quiet place to live. It has not known war for almost a decade. You all are a big reason for this period of peace and prosperity. The kingdom has a very small standing army. The King maintains peace by the use of secret agents. Each of you currently serves the King in this capacity, dealing with threats to the kingdom through stealth, diplomacy, and trickery rather than brute force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The biggest threat to the peace of the kingdom comes from Hawksland to the West. Hawksland is ruled by King Kith, a petty and warlike man who would like nothing more than to send his armies sweeping over Callador. The skills of yourselves and other agents have so far prevented this from happening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tonight is a time for play, however, not work. Each of you has been invited to a grand ball in honor of the King and queens 30th anniversary. Everybody who is anybody is here tonight and it will definitely be a grand affair. You have arrived at the ball and are mingling with the guests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
