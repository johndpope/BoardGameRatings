			<description>Heroes of the Arena is a battle royale themed, hide and seek boardgame. Players pick a Hero and try to survive for as long as possible in a hostile Arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to win, you have to search and damage opponent heroes with an ancient machine throughout 20 different hideouts. Use the pointing device in the middle of the gameboard to target a hideout and roll the hideout die to determine which hideout you hit. But careful! Hitting your own hero will also reveal and damage him and every move you make may give your opponents the information they need to locate your hero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every Hero brings unique abilities and the Arena influences the game with a customizable 40-Card event and items card deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
