							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ghost Train</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;News often travels slow in the Walk of Man once one gets outside the boundaries of the larger cities. Most news comes in the form of rumors brought in by train passengers and hunters returning home after expeditions on the plains. The latest rumors have taken a dark turn. Smaller settlements across the Walk have been found deserted. Most look as if the people just packed up and left. Nothing of value has been left behind, except for the larger permanent buildings. Three towns have disappeared so far with no one left dead or alive, and no one seems to have any clue as to what is going on. Smaller towns are getting scared, and the citizens are arming themselves more than usual against whatever strange events are taking place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
