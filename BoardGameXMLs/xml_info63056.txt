							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horror Rules: Book of Bad Guys #2</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MORE Brand New Bad Guys!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you got the Horror Rules Book of Bad Guys #1 and it was great for awhile - people were screaming, dying and losing their minds right and left... everything was back to normal and Horror Rules was Horror Rules again. Then the screaming started to fade and your players began to feel safe again. The magic was gone. Well, no prob! We STILL know EXACTLY what you need - MORE BRAND NEW BAD GUYS!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This second installment in the popular Book of Bad Guys line is another big, bold collection of ten completely original, brand-spanking-new Bad Guys. Just like in the first, you won't find tired, warmed-over old critters like ghosts and vampires, but ten never-before-seen and totally creeperific baddies designed to terrify, possess, torment, devour and otherwise bring harm to your players. Be prepared to watch them cower in fear as they face such fiendish foes as the &amp;quot;Doom Worm,&amp;quot; the &amp;quot;Black Newt,&amp;quot; the &amp;quot;Dump Haunt&amp;quot; and the sinister, diabolical (and ever-popular) &amp;quot;Mumbo Jumbo!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
