							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sneeze: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Sneeze is all about staying as healthy as possible while making sure that you're not too healthy and that everyone else has more infections than you. Be infected and infect others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not good enough to simply get rid of all your germs. Players have to strategically infect themselves and cure themselves and others to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last player who is not too sick wins. For three or more players, a player is too sick once infected with five different colored infections. While a too sick player can't win the game, he or she continues to play and infect other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
