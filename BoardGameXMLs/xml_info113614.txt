			<description>Funny Circus is a memory game for young children, not as simple as it sounds. Every player has 6 cards in front of him.&lt;br/&gt;They look at them and turn face-down.&lt;br/&gt;Every turn players reverse the position of two cards of their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then they start to drawing a cards from the middle of the table and if the right card is drawn player must find it among his cards. If he finds correct card he may discard it. If he finds incorrect card he gets one penalty-card with elephant's dung.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player who discards all of his cards is the winner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
