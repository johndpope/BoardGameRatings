			<description>Unlucky Sevens is an extremely simple and portable game Vegas-style dice game that can be played in a very short amount of time, or over a series of rounds for a longer experience. It can be played stand-alone or as a betting or challenge game for points, rewards, or even drinks. It is simple enough for kids, but with the utility to entertain adults as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling a pair of dice, after each roll taking a Point card corresponding to the roll made. (Even if another player has that card).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When each one of the cards finally belongs to a player, the game ends immediately and players total up their score. But beware, the 7 is Unlucky, and whoever is stuck with it will suffer a negative point penalty!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
