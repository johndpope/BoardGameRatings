			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Valon is at war... the Usurper Emperor Morded leads his musket weidling columns of Elven infantry and squadrons of noble cavalry against the rest of Valon. Orc fights alongside Dwarf in a desperate bid to hold back the Elven armies, the battlefields are shrouded in smoke as flintloques and artillerie smash the ranks and files of disciplined warriors. It is a time of war - it is a time of desperation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ranke &amp;amp; Vyle is a set of Company level Black Powder Fantasy Rules set in the world of Flintloque - the Skirmish. Written by Flintloque's author Steve Blease, Ranke &amp;amp; Vyle takes you the next step up the rung of command, tasking you with maintaining your troops in cohesive units and recognisable formations, balancing situations and getting maximum usage out of your troops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ranke &amp;amp; Vyle contains full rules for Company level actions including mass uni firing, formations and unit movement as well as introducing Wyld Magick users onto the battlefield with all the unpredictability that comes with them. Racial statistics are also included for thirteen races ranging from Orcs to Halflings, and one hundred and twenty-seven different troop types. Ranke &amp;amp; Vyle also includes six challenging scenarios set in the Mordredian Wars to start you off with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This edition of Ranke &amp;amp; Vyle is a limited edition product and only 300 numbered and signed copies will be made available worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
