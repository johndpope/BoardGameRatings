							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Conjunction: A Role-Playing Game</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within these pages, you will find the door to a world undreamed of. Andral is a world of magic and monsters, danger and daring, heroes and horrors. On each classic staple of fantasy games, there is a new, fresh twist. And you will face these wonders and menaces wearing a face you know better than any character you have played in any game before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must face Andral as yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wonders of The Conjunction are for your own eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do You have what it takes to step into the world of your dreams?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Conjunction is a brand new fantasy game in a classic tradition. In it, players create the story of ordinary people drawn into a fantastic world that is not their own. Players are encouraged to play themselves, but rules are provided in case some players or game masters wish to do otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules of Conjunction are simple and straightforward. This game is designed to be learned in under an hour, with play beginning immediately. Character creation is quick and easy, and takes mere minutes, as most character abilities are gained in play. In an original twist, character creation is worked seamlessly into the play of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting of the Conjunction is the world of Andral. Andral is a continent with millions of years of history, and with a lush variety of cultures and wildlife. It is a world where the mysterious and alien Fae make war with the ancient and elemental dragons on the borderlands of medieval kingdoms. It is a world where laughing, ghostly water babies splash in the crashing surf at the foot of towering opal cliffs. It is a world of enchantment, where magic touches every aspect of existence, making life strange, whimsical, and, at times, terrifying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conjunction is a complete role-playing game, and includes everything needed to play, other than dice. Self-contained at a thick 140 pages, it is one of the best bargains you will find!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
