							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Essential Questions: Magic Users</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wizards. They're a staple in every high fantasy world and we've dealt with some of the big guns like Gandalf, Merlin, and Harry Potter in popular fiction for decades. Magic in and of itself is such a creative force you'd think we would see all sorts of fun wizards, but why do so many of them seem to fit the same molds again and again? The apprentice, the experienced but not famous wizard, and the wizard of legend. Isn't there room for more?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Essential Questions: Magic Users asks 7 essential questions that you may not have pondered before. Where does your wizard stay? What does the place look like? What do they wear? Who is their doctor or veterinarian? (Some wizards have familiars and pets!) And what sorts of good and bad attributes do they embody?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a few pages, this Spark aims to inspire you to think about wizards in different ways to help you see them in a whole new light!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
