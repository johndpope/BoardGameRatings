							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Munchkin Fairy Dust Handbag Of Holding</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Handbag of Holding was a promotional item originally given away by Steve Jackson Games during the August 2009 Gen Con in Indianapolis. It was reprinted in February 2012 and given away to people who spent $75 or more at the publisher's online store. Starting on March 6th, 2012 it briefly became available for purchase at the online store. So what had once been a highly collectible item due to its rarity, was now just another piece of Munchkin merchandise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The handbag is a standard handbag, colored pink and with a picture of the Sparkly Good Fairy from the Munchkin Fairy Dust booster pack. As a handbag, it's nothing exceptional, but it also comes with a special rule for use in any Munchkin card game that includes the Munchkin Fairy Dust expansion. The rule allows you to take a card from the Fairy Dust deck's discard pile, once per game (see the corresponding board game version for details).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the Munchkin series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
