							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beatrix Potter&#039;s Rummy</name>
									
			<description>This is a very simple rummy type game for young children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck consists of 44 cards. 14 sets of 3 identical cards each, plus 2 signpost cards to be used as wilds. Deal 6 cards to each player with a draw deck in the middle. Turn over the top card to form the discard pile. Each player's turn consists of drawing 1 card and discarding a card. A player will always have only 6 cards either in hand or in matching sets laid down in front of him. When players have formed sets in their hands by drawing and discarding, they may lay them down face up. The first player to have 2 full sets in front of him is the winner of the hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
