			<description>Players have to answer questions as quickly as possible but are not allowed to say Yes or No (Ja or Nee in Dutch). There is a timer. When all questions on a card have been answered without Yes or No, the player can keep the card. When the time is over, the next player can attempt to earn as many cards as possible within the time available.&lt;br/&gt;The player who finishes with the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
