			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VOID is a trimmed-down space sim/RPG with a pure emphasis on space combat and ship upgrades: there is no plot whatsoever. But there are dozens of ships (4 different races), weapons, and other equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is relatively straightforward. Move from system to system destroying everything in site, collecting loot and credits in the process. As you progress you'll encounter new, more powerful enemies. The controls themselves are a rather original blend of tilt and touch interface. Tilt your device to turn your ship, but press the screen to boost (either forward or back), brake, and fire weapons. This combination of controls allows you to take advantage of the full range of 2D frictionless maneuvers, which are affected not only by your ship's acceleration, top speed, and turning speed, but by its total mass including weapons and equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
