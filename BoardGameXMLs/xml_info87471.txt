			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content:&lt;br/&gt;5 big leaf shaped double-sided boards&lt;br/&gt;32 smaller leafs with pictures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal:&lt;br/&gt;To find 1 unique picture on each board.&lt;br/&gt;Each round winner will receive 1 small pictured card. Get 5 cards to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set-Up:&lt;br/&gt;Set all 5 board so everyone could see them.Don't matter how or which way the boards are places, there always are only 1 picture same on each board.&lt;br/&gt;32 smaller cards will remain with the game leader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game:&lt;br/&gt;Game leader (older player) has all the 32 cards. He searched the one card that matches the picture on each board and placed it secretly before him. Only he/she knows that animal picture. To make it easier, game leaser may choose the right animal and other 4 animals and mix them and then place then on the table for everyone to see. One of them is the right one. The first one to name the right animal on each board, gets to keep the card. Cards should be hidden from other players.&lt;br/&gt;Each players gets only 1 guess.&lt;br/&gt;This goes until one player has gotten 5 cards.&lt;br/&gt;After each round, game leader collects all board and places them in any order, only making sure that already picked animals would come up again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner:&lt;br/&gt;Game is over when 5th card for someone is collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
