							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ultimate Rulership (5E)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes Rule!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Rulership is a massive expansion to the 5th Edition rules for building and ruling a domain of your very own! Building upon the rules introduced in Kingdoms from  Legendary Games, Ultimate Rulership provides new rulership edicts for festivals, espionage, and more, as well as expanded guidelines on founding and investing in your kingdom alongside a vast array of noble titles and forms of address. Build villages into towns and cities as your population expands with your territory, and enhance them with magical improvements, natural advantages, over a dozen new buildings from aeries to lumberyards, or construct magnificent hanging gardens, lighthouses, or a magnificent colossus, or an entire exotic settlement from cliff dwellings to treetop cities and underwater cities! Add to that a new system of danger in managing kingdom events and over 70 settlement attributes to make each city unique, from natural geography like resettled ruins and strategic location to a legendary marketplace or rumormongering citizens, or even magical attributes like a planar crossroads, slumbering monster, or a god-ruled city! Plus dozens of tables to reference every rule. Your heroes can establish their own domains, raising cities and monuments to their glory and becoming a force to be reckoned with in the campaign world, striking out into a position of leadership with amazing depth and detail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
