Research computer programmer with Top Secret &amp;quot;UMBRA&amp;quot; clearance has been killed in a tragic auto accident under suspicious circumstances.

But, almost before your disk drive is up to speed, the case has exploded into one of international espionage, and you are the prime suspect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are swept up in a series of events so diabolical, so mind-boggling, it will take all your skill and perseverance to unravel the plot and prove your innocence. Your only hard evidence is an audio &amp;quot;clue&amp;quot; cassette and your access to the massive COPNET data banks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you are led on a trail of secrecy and intrigue, you discover that you are both the pursuer and the pursued! Yet, it is up to you to pierce the veil of the most incredible deception ever undertaken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, beyond this mystery...beyond your innocence...lies a plot so evil, so sinister that it must be uncovered and stopped...before the world's time runs out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Photo captions:]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Special &amp;quot;clue&amp;quot; cassette gets your investigation started.
