			<description>The bell has rung, lessons are finished and the kids are ready for fun. It's After School from Waddington&amp;rsquo;s, a quiz based game with a delightful twist designed with children (and parents) in mind. Children move around the colorfully animated board on skateboard playing pieces and discover that if they learn their ABC's and 123's there is fun to be had after school. By answering questions correctly children earn &amp;quot;Smart Points&amp;quot; that help them start a paper route, car wash, or open a lemonade stand for extra spending money. The first player to buy all the things that children like - comics, games, toys and a bike - wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
