			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three classic gambling card games for the Bally Astrocade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blackjack (1 to 4 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The manual states that the game is played by Las Vegas rules, noting three exceptions: there is no insurance, you may not split pairs if more than two players are playing, and you are considered to have a winning hand if you are dealt five cards that total less than 21 (the latter two rules likely stem from issues of limitations on screen space and system memory.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The computer plays the role of the dealer and only a single deck of cards is simulated. Players start with a stake of $1,000 and can bet any amount on each hand. The game ends if all players run out of money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poker (2 to 4 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A variation on five-card draw where all cards are dealt face up. No more than three cards may be drawn. Each player starts with a bankroll of $1000. The maximum bet is $100 and there is a three raise maximum. The game ends when all but one player has run out of money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acey-Deucey or &amp;quot;In-Between&amp;quot; (1 to 4 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player antes $10 and is dealt two cards. The player then bets against the pot that the next card will fall between the two cards. Ties lose, and Aces always represent a &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; (i.e. the lowest card in the deck.) The game ends if all players run out of money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
