			<description>Each team plays in turn, proceeding in a clockwise direction. One player from the team takes a card from the box &amp;amp; throws the two dice. They then have one minute to communicate a category printed on the card to the other members of their team, by drawing or miming different things in that category until a member of the team guesses the category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is important to remember that players are trying to communicate a category, rather than specific things. For this reason, it is worth waiting for the player drawing or miming to draw or mime two things or more to make sure of the category being communicated. For instance, if a player draws a glass full of drink, they may be trying to communicate 'Drinks! - but if they then draw an ice cream, it is more likely to be Cold Things !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pictionary with a twist - great party fun !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
