			<description>Here is an interesting variant on the Battleship concept.  Each player has 2 boards side by side, one is on your left - this is where you place your ships secretly.  On the right is where you make your guesses, but when you make your guess, you push a Laser Missile Launcher - if you get a hit, some light misting water squirts the other player.  It also features sound effects to include explosions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the classic Chinese checkers game board reconfigured as &amp;quot;Canadian checkers&amp;quot; for Canada's centennial in 1967, now there's Electronic Hydro Battle--an even more elaborate, tricked-out version of that other battleship-sinking game, which here shall remain nameless. Apparently it's no longer enough that an opponent calls out grid coordinates in an effort to find and sink the hidden fleet you've placed on your side of the board. With Electronic Hydro Battle, players guess the location of opponents' ships by inserting a wired &amp;quot;torpedo launcher&amp;quot; into the screen, switchboard-style. Missile sounds are heard; if you strike an opposing craft, you'll also hear a blast, followed by the spectacle of your victim getting sprayed with a squirt of water from the game's refillable tank! Whether this funky marriage of &amp;quot;Mighty Mo&amp;quot; and Gong Show represents a high-water mark of fun or a sign of low tide is up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Hydro Battle game is to be the first player to destroy all five of your opponent's ships. If the Launching Sound is followed by a Blast Sound that will also be followed with your opponent getting sprayed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
