			<description>&amp;quot;Dream up your next reality, and we'll take care of all the details!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Interdimensional Travel Agency, each player plays as a travel agent responsible to manipulate an interdimensional gateway to create alternate realms explicitly tailored to various travelers' designs. At the beginning of the game, each agent must choose two Travelers to attempt to satisfy, in secret. On each turn, a player plays cards from their hand in one of three ways: As a dimensional &amp;quot;trait&amp;quot; that they configuring the gateway with, as an action that manipulates the gateway or players' hands, or as a discard to be replaced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a Traveler is satisfied, it is revealed and added to the discard pile. The game is over when one player has satisfied both of their assigned Travelers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
