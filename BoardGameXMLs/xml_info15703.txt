			<description>SGB-18 Dreadnaught (1986) (JPY 3800)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subtitled &amp;ldquo;Return to the Dreadnoughts Age!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two half-sized maps of all-blue, large hex water terrain. Two countersheets (308) with Panzerblitz-sized counters. Two identical single-sided PAC with 8 small charts each. A rulebook (28 pgs) with 8 scenarios ranging from 1917 to 1924 (with a SF one in 3325 (not kidding!). The rules only look to be about 5-6 pages long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From what I have been told, this is an extremely popular game I Japan. The auction prices are all rather high, even for punched games. This might have something to do with the easy rules and only a few charts. Each counter has 6 numbers and they are back printed. The back side has two numbers reduced by one vs. the unit&amp;rsquo;s front side. There is unit facing and maybe a line movement rule. No record keeping or markers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
