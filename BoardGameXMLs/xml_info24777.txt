			<description>From front cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A Beautiful Game of Skill, Strategy, and Maneuvers&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maneuvering is the new easy to learn game.  It is an action packed board game which combines skill, chance, and special maneuvers to determine a winner.  It incorporates an entirely new concept which is sophisticated and considerably more attractive than conventional board games. (i.e., chess or backgammon).  The game is played on a 15 1/2&amp;quot; x 15 1/2&amp;quot; Maneuvering board where each player has twenty-four ships to protect and defend.  To start the game, these ships are positioned in the first three rows of the board (as shown).  For each turn, the player rolls two dice.  He then moves 2 ships, one for each die the number of spaces indicated by both dice.  The object of the game is to capture all of your opponent's ships or to win by trapping your opponent's ship(s).  The first player to complete one of the game objectives is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
