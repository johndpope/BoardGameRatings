							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ossuary</name>
									
			<description>The last thing you remember is receiving an unsatisfying answer. A plunge through the fundamental chaos takes you to a place of bones. Great power can be found within the Ossuary, but those who are not lying to themselves are lying to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ossuary is a dark, puzzling game where the player explores a strange underworld full of people slowly gathering dust. It explores themes of order, chaos, sin, and virtue, and it draws strong inspiration from the Discordian religious tradition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
