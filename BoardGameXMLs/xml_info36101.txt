			<description>A baseball game played using dice and cards and incorporating the general rules of baseball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players draw two cards each turn and may hold a hand of up to seven cards. After the card draw, two six-sided dice are rolled to determine the result of each &amp;ldquo;at bat.&amp;rdquo; The die roll result may be modified by the play of Hit, Batter, Effect, and Pitch Cards. After the batter&amp;rsquo;s fate is determined, and the base runners advanced (if necessary), Fielding Cards may be played. The deck also includes Automatic Result cards which may be played in lieu of the batting roll before the dice are rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
