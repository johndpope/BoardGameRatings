			<description>subtitle:&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Module B2.1&lt;br/&gt;A Political Fantasy Option for “The Keep on the Borderlands” Adventure Module B2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the acknowledgements:&lt;br/&gt;This monster of a module that lies before you was originally written on a dare issued to us by the Save or Die Podcast (Wildgame Productions). A few months ago, Corbett Kirkley (of the Gagmen) wrote in to Save or Die with an insane question: how could someone run a classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure in the style of George R.R. Martins&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Songs of Fire and Ice&amp;rdquo; series (more commonly known as &amp;ldquo;Game of Thrones&amp;rdquo; series on HBO). The intrepid hosts of Save or Die gave Corbett a couple suggestions , but they ultimately concluded that no one was crazy enough to try it before. It was then that they issued their &amp;ldquo;dare&amp;rdquo; (whether they realized it or not): If Corbett really wanted a political fantasy D&amp;amp;D campaign, he should write it himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment:&lt;br/&gt;from Episode 7 - The Game of Kobolds&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not a complete scenario, it provides faction options, NPCs, &amp;quot;cut-scenes&amp;quot; and sub-plots for B2: The Keep on the Borderlands.  A copy of that module is required to make full use of this source material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
