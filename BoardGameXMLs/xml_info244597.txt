			<description>Memo Bauernhof provides entertaining memory fun for 2-4 children from 2 years. Who can remember the positions of the barnyard pictures and collect the most pairs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Did you turn over two of the same picture? Excellent! You can take the pair and keep it.  &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;Did you turn over two different pictures? Too bad, but it's OK!   Once everyone else has has a chance to see  the barnyard cards you can turn them back over again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End of the game    &lt;br/&gt;Have all the pairs been collected? Then all children place their barnyard cards next to each other: The player with the longest row of cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
