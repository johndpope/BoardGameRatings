			<description>This is the children's version of the party game Roller Coaster Hippo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to collect hippo chits worth 44 points. To earn these, players have to complete challenges. What type of challenge a player has to complete is decided by die rolls and what space on the board the player's piece lands on. Challenges come in the following forms: pantomime and drawing (active player and player who guessed correctly both get a random hippo chit with values from 2-5), (un)true stories (a story is read from the card, active player has to guess if it's true), party games (various challenges), and bigger/smaller (cards with values from 1-9 are placed in a row, player has to guess if the value on a card is higher or lower than that of the previous card).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect 44 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
