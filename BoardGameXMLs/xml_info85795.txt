			<description>&amp;quot;Prison Break: The Conspiracy is an action-adventure video game based on the first season of the Fox television series Prison Break, released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360  and PlayStation 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was released on March 19, 2010 in Germany, March 26, 2010 in the United Kingdom and Europe, and March 30, 2010 in North America. The game had been in development for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 for release in February 2009, but was canceled when Brash Entertainment closed down.

Once the game was polished and nearly finished, it was picked up by new publisher Deep Silver.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Prison Break: The Conspiracy&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
