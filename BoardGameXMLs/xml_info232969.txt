							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lady Godiva</name>
									
			<description>This little card game is based on the story of Lady Godiva (and Peeping Tom).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 36 cards in total: 28 number cards, 7 Lady Godiva cards, and 1 Peeping Tom card. Note that number cards are arranged in a pyramid style (or &amp;quot;Dalumuti&amp;quot; style): seven &amp;quot;7&amp;quot; cards, six &amp;quot;6&amp;quot; cards, five &amp;quot;5&amp;quot; cards. etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt with certain number of cards. The first player to empty his or her hand without being eliminated is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, he can either pass or play some cards. If he passes, he does nothing: it is simply the next player's turn. If he chooses to play, he lays down one or more cards and announces a number, which is seven or lower. For example, if he announces &amp;quot;six&amp;quot; and plays 3 cards face down, he is claiming that those 3 cards are all number &amp;quot;six&amp;quot; cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If no one challenges, it is the next player's turn. The next player has to either pass or play some cards, just like the previous player, but he must announce a lower number than what the previous player claimed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If someone decides to challenge (&amp;quot;Peep&amp;quot;), she opens the cards played by the current player. If the challenge fails (i.e., the challenged player was honest), the challenger should take all the cards played so far. If the challenge succeeds, the challenged player should take all the cards played so far (or will be eliminated from the game immediately if there is any Lady Godiva card among the played cards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues in this manner until there is a single winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
