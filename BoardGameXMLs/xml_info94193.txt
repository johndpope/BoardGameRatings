							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Timothy Bradstreet: Vampire</name>
									
			<description>From the Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What yer holdin' in yer sticky little fingers represents one of my most exquisite pleasures. If there's anything I love, it's drawing dark portraits of whatever I want, spilling my brain on a page. The only condition: &amp;quot;They're vampires.&amp;quot; Ever since I saw Katheryn Bigelow's film Near Dark (one of only two or three in the theater... five times), I've wanted to illustrate the work from Vampire: The Masquerade and what you see before you. White Wolf Game Studio gave me the chance to do it. I don't know if I or they expected the tremendous response that we received from all of you who are hip to the alternative, sensual, modern primitive, tattooed, gypsy white-trash aspects of the images created here, but we're thankful you did respond. A lot of influences played a part in this work: sex (I love to do the erotic ones), love, pain, frustration, strength, and of course the CD Vulgar Display of Power writhing in the background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a collection of artwork by Tim Bradstreet for Vampire: The Masquerade. It showcases ten full-page black-and-white portraits of different vampire characters that will be familiar to owners of other books. These are printed on individual card sheets, stored within a folded envelope that includes a biography of the artist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
