			<description>Kingdom's Tarot: The Guardians of Destiny is a card game that allows the player to control one of the Lords of Tarot clans, these clans have similarity with the suits of the conventional deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of each clan in that realm is to influence the maximum amount of souls possible, because it is the divine mission attributed to these clans. Of course, every soul has a different value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each more valuable souls obtained, these lords will be send to the higher plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every two hundred years a new Lord is chosen to lead each clan, the former is judged by the Guardians of Destiny (Major Arcana) .Only the Lord that influenced a more relevant number of souls is taken to the heavenly realm, the rest is exiled to the world lower from where never they can leave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a lord is chosen to achieve the heavenly realm, all the souls of his clan accompany it, however, the clan members of the exiled Lords do not follow the underworld actually their souls are recycled, and a new opportunity is thrown up the time when their souls are part of the winning clan and can be elevated to the higher plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a fifth clan, Corvullus, this clan is the representative of the creatures of the underworld, every two hundred years a new Demon Lord is chosen to lead it, if this creature emerge victorious conquest a whole principality in the underworld if she loses , is chained and tortured for all eternity in the catacombs of the King of the Underworld, Luxus the dark lord. Often these lords are the same defeated in previous years. If this clan is the winner, the souls of all lords go to the underworld. Therefore, although it is a great honor to become a clan of Lord, is both a great burden because their failure condemn him for all eternity. This game is set in the years 1200 - 1400 DC, so the lords are trying to influence souls of the medieval period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played 2-4 players, each one will control a Lord of one of the clans, the clans have its own characteristics to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player uses a book that contains several cards that will change the game, with conditions, influence and destination cards. These cards will affect the souls of the board directly.&lt;br/&gt;In the setup, before beginning of the first round, there will be a draft among the players to get the Majors Arcana Cards, these cards change instantly or permanently the conditions of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round 5 new souls will be revealed in &amp;quot;Souls Nursery&amp;quot; in this place players will be able to see who offers to influence souls when the soul is with an established influence it will incarnate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On earth the soul will pass to three phases, past, present and future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after the first player intended seven souls, the one who gets the most soul points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
