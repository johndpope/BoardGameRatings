			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for Victory Games&amp;trade; James Bond 007&amp;trade; roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is suitable for two or three rookie characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure starts on September 5, 2012. The characters has been on a routine assignment following a British trade delegation in Tanzania, in Dar es-Salaam. Even though Dodoma is now capitol of Tanzania, many governmental institutions are still located in Dar es-Salaam, among then the ministry of trade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters have been here for three days reinforcing the understaffed local station house. There is much information to handle and dispatches to read through as this trade meeting is about sealing bilateral deals, figuring out what the competition is negotiating about and counter that. Great Britain is here with representatives from British Petroleum to extend the deal where BP export oil to Tanzania in return Britain will import raw materials, foremost cloth and agricultural products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters don&amp;rsquo;t really like the idea of being errand boys for politicians and corporate leaders, but they know that MI6 usually has to do such things too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, groups of tourists visits the areas around Lake Victoria to see this amazing nature and try to spot some of the great wildlife of Africa. In one of these groups are a newly wed couple, Amelia and Jack Thompson. Amelia is the daughter of Lord Timothy Howard and his wife Theresa Howard. One of the many rebel groups that rove these wilderness around the Tanzanian - Ugandan border raided a nightly lodging and kidnapped four of the tourists, among them The Thompson couple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Lord Timothy Howard happens to be on the Civil Service Commission Board, and more directly responsible for MI5 and MI6, he contacted M directly when he was informed about the incident and M knows who you kneel to so she made a rescue operation for the MI6, but with James Bond and two other 00s away and no one else within a reasonable distance, she remembered the group that was lent to the Ministry of Trade to help out in Tanzania with the trade negotiations and decided that would be the best shot. Better act quick then wait for a better chance that might not come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rebels have brought their prisoners back to an abandoned mining facility where they now are hiding and waiting to contact their leader about their catch, and let him decide the ransom to demand. They are not very alert and some of them have been chewing Khat all day and are feeling a little dizzy. They are heavily armed though with both automatic rifles and machine guns, but they lack night vision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
