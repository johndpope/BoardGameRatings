			<description>You've journeyed deep into the rainforests of southern Mexico and made the discovery of a lifetime. Now, returning home, a peaceful respite is in order &amp;mdash; but your relaxation is cut short when an uninvited guest arrives and tells you that the artifact you uncovered is not what is seems and now the entire Earth is in danger. Her wild claims suddenly become more believable as your world erupts into chaos. Three tasks stand before you at once: you must protect the relic from falling into the wrong hands, solve the mystery of a missing friend, and determine whether to trust your mysterious guest. The stakes are high and time is short. Which will you pursue?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Threads of Fate is the first Mythos Pack in &amp;quot;The Forgotten Age&amp;quot; cycle for Arkham Horror: The Card Game. This new scenario throws you into the investigation like never before with three separate Act decks that are each in play simultaneously. With few leads and a limited amount of time before the trail runs cold, you must weigh your evidence to decide which leads to follow and which to ignore. Your choices will permanently shape your adventure throughout &amp;quot;The Forgotten Age&amp;quot; cycle, so you must choose wisely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
