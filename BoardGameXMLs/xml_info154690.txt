			<description>THE SUDAN ABLAZE is semi-historical simulation of the Mahdi Uprisings in the Sudan during the later stage of the Victorian Era.  As the Commander of British Forces in the Egypt and the Sudan, you must protect the British Settlements and squash the swelling fanatical Sudanese forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: As the Commander of British Forces in the Egypt and the Sudan, the Player must use his forces to protect the British Settlements and squash the Forces of the Mahdi by capturing their Capital at El Obeid in South-Western Sudan before the Campaign Deck runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME FEATURES: The game features a fun and simplistic method for resolving solitaire combat tactically, rules for Heroes that can make an impact on the outcome of battles, and lots of colorful game counters.
