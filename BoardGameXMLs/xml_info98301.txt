			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This compilation game updates both Asteroids and Asteroids Deluxe. The gameplay remains the same as the original games. The player controls a ship that rotates around in a top-down vertical plane. Asteroids come hurtling towards the ship and the player must break them apart with their cannon. These smaller parts can eventually be destroyed. There is also a UFO that shoots back at the player's ship. Asteroids Deluxe added shields to the player's ship so that they would not be killed in one hit. It also introduced the satellite cluster that could actually home in on the player's ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This XBLA edition includes the Classic and the Evolved versions of both games. Evolved indicates that there are better graphics, more colors, and a more detailed soundtrack. The player can also select between two difficulty settings for each: Normal or &amp;quot;Throttle Monkey&amp;quot; (there is more of everything, and it is all faster and more intense.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
