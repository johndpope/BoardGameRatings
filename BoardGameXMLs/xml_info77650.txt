			<description>Bubble Trouble is a computer game for Macintosh computers developed by Ambrosia Software where a goldfish battles against different kinds of sea creatures. Like many of Ambrosia's arcade-style games, it is a revisitation of a classic video game concept, in this case its concept is taken from Pengo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bubbles appear all over the playing field and can be used to defeat enemies by launching them in their direction, crushing them. However, the bubbles are just as deadly to the player if they are launched in his or her direction. Only certain tougher enemies can launch bubbles. Certain bubbles contain useful items, pushing them together can rack up points. Bubbles that are blue, purple, yellow, or green will bounce off of surfaces once they have been launched, bouncing a number of times dependent on their color, for example blues bounce once, purples twice etc. Some bubbles also contain dynamite, which will detonate either by igniting or by being pushed towards a target. There are two kinds of dynamite, a red one and a purple one; the latter has a much larger blast radius. Occasionally, a bonus bubble will float up across the screen, which can bestow powers of invisibility, or temporarily capture all enemies in static bubbles. Bubbles containing the letters of the word &amp;quot;extra&amp;quot; also appear, which provide a score bonus to the player and the equivalent of the capture bubble when all five are collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four kinds of enemies in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Blue Fish - They are slow, and easy to avoid. They cannot launch bubbles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Red Eeel - Moves faster than blue fishes, and can launch bubbles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Grey Shark - Has the capability to launch a special bubble to trap the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Starfish -The most dangerous enemy in the game. They are extremely fast, and can launch bubbles in quick succession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Starfish will appear on any level if the player manages to push two of the gem-containing bubbles together with only a few of the enemies remaining out of the original complement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Bubble Trouble , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
