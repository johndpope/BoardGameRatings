							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Clonk Rage</name>
									
			<description>Clonk Rage is the current stable 2D title of the Clonk series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main focus of Clonk Rage is on the new fullscreen menu for player management and scenario selection which comes in proper gaming style and transitions smoothly into the actual game worlds. Players new to Clonk will find a completely reworked mode of control much closer to the principles of well known Jump'n'Run games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The network code has been completely rewritten and now allows considerably faster internet play while still supporting the physically demanding landscape simulation of Clonk. This is complemented by numerous additional networking features such as a lobby, chat, and a new league server.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clonk Rage is the first Clonk game to be released simultaneously for the Windows, Linux, and Macintosh platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
