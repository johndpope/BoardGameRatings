							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">F.R.E.E.America</name>
									
			<description>From the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The future is now!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;America in the late 1990s is a different place. An overwhelmed federal govenment tries to keep it together while the states form their own regional authorities; foreign investors own entire cities; new technologies make the rich richer, while the poor are thrown out of work; individuals with unexplainable special abilities - metabilities - hire out as mercenaries to the forces of both good and evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Farfetched? Some of it is happening already...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;F.R.E.E.America is the high-powered supplement to F.R.E.E.Lancers, describing in detail the society, politics, and culture of this dark near-future world for the TOPSECRET/S.I espionage roleplaying game. From the Great Lakes Authority to Culpepper's Wall on the Texas-Mexico border, from the high-tech labs of Greater Massachusetts to the disaster-wrecked West Coast, there's as much action, intrigue, mystery, and adventure as anyone could want. Come visit the America of a not-too-distant future - F.R.E.E.America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
