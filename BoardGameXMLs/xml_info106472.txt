			<description>Objective:s&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To accumulate $100,000 in  &amp;quot;rare coins.&amp;quot; Actual coins count $20,000 each - coin cards have designated values $2,000 or $5,000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment:&lt;br/&gt;Gameboard and trays with 12 &amp;quot;money bags&amp;quot;, 10 real uncirculated coins from 10 different countries symbolizing valuable &amp;quot;rare coins&amp;quot;, 10 Coin Selection Cards, and 50 playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Method of Play:&lt;br/&gt;1. Players sit opposite each other&lt;br/&gt;2. Remove coins from bottom of box (undernearth plastic tray).  Place coins at random, (in full view of both players) one under each of 10 &amp;quot;money bags&amp;quot; (2 bags will remain empty).&lt;br/&gt;3. Dealer shuffles the small Coin Selection Cards (those depicting the actual coins used in the game) and deals five to himself and five to his opponent, alternating and FACE UP. During the subsequent play of the game, each player will try to obtain as many of the coins shown on his small cards as possible. Obviously, this combination of coins will change with each game.&lt;br/&gt;4. Dealer shuffles the Playing Cards and deals five cards to himself and five cards to his opponent, alternating, and FACE DOWN.  The remaining cards are placed faced down in the DRAW tray.&lt;br/&gt;5. Players pick up the five playing cards. The dealer draws a card and must then play a card from his hand either in front of him to count toward his score, or into the discard tray. At no time after playing a card may a player have more than five cards remaining in his hand.&lt;br/&gt;6. If a player has a SEARCH CARD, he may play it face down in the discard tray and then &amp;quot;search&amp;quot; for one of his coins (designated on his Coin Selection Cards).  He does this by touching one of the &amp;quot;money bags&amp;quot; and declaring, for example &amp;quot;the Turkish kurus is in this bag.&amp;quot; He then lifts the &amp;quot;bag&amp;quot; and if the Turkish kurus IS underneath the &amp;quot;bag&amp;quot;, he removes the coin and places it in front of him as part of his score.  He then replaces the &amp;quot;money bag&amp;quot;.  As the game progresses, ocoins and empty areas will be exposed and it will become increasingly important to remember their locations.  If a player exposes one of his opponent's coin, he merely replaces the bag and it is the opponent's turn.  If the opponent has a SEARCH CARD, he is in the happy position of eing able to acquire a coin immediately.  Players draw and play cards alternately.&lt;br/&gt;7. If a player has a $5,000 or $2,000 COIN CARD he may hold it for future play, he may play it face up in front of him counting toward his score, or he may discard it.&lt;br/&gt;8. If a player has a WINDFALL CARD he may lift ANY bag and remove the coin - IF it is one of HIS coins.&lt;br/&gt;9. If a player has an ILLEGAL COIN CARD, he may play it on his opponent's score pile. The opponent then may not play ANY card except a LEGAL COIN CARD or a SEARCH CARD on his next turn. In the meantime he must discard one card into the discard tray after every draw. If he plays a SEARCH CARD, this permits him to search for a coin. If he plays a LEGAL COIN CARD, he takes no further action until his next turn.&lt;br/&gt;10. If the &amp;quot;Draw&amp;quot; tray is emptied before the game ends, reshuffle those in the &amp;quot;discard&amp;quot; tray and continue play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHO WINS:&lt;br/&gt;The first player to accumulate $100,000 or more in coins and cards. Actual coins from COIN CARDS count $20,000 each.  The COIN CARDS count $2,000 or $5,000 according to their face value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
