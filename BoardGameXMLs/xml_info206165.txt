			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to the Knoll Street School for Wayward Kittens!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Knoll Street School for Wayward Kittens is a big house where orphaned kittens are fostered until they are big enough to be adopted by their forever homes. To the humans, KSSWK is just an ordinary home where they take in kittens who need some love &amp;ndash; but to the kittens, it's like a school where you learn to be a real cat. As a student at KSSWK, you'll go on exciting kitty adventures and learn important lessons about how to grow up into an awesome cat. Your most important lesson will be how to control your laser &amp;ndash; a unique and powerful supernatural ability that the humans don't know about!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
