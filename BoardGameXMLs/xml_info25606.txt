							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warbirds in Miniature</name>
									
			<description>Warbirds in Miniature is a game that recreates the epic struggles in the skies during World War II. The game is designed to be played by 2 or more people, although solitaire play is still very possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players select the maneuver that their aircraft will perform from a maneuver schedule unique to each aircraft. Once all the players have revealed their maneuvers, players move their aircraft and then the shooting begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game provides for the use of air/flight stands to be used with miniatures, and is played on a hexmat large enough to hold several aircraft at a time. When planes are damaged, they are marked with either counters or specially made clips resembling smoke or fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Warbirds in Miniature Rules package comes with a 34 page rulebook, 2 double sided sets of charts, 2 double sided sample aircraft sheets, and a CD with over 50 Aircraft sheets covering all the major combat aircraft flown in World War 2. The CD also includes some early Jets for later World War 2 and for use in Korean War scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
