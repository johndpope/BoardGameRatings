			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Striker II is the miniatures combat rules of 58th century warfare, for use with Traveler:The New Era. Now the epic planetary engagements of the New Era, The Final War, or the Frontier Wars are under your control, allowing you to command battalions of lift infantry, drop troops, and grav armor. These rules are fully compatible with Traveler, and so also allow miniatures resolution of role-playing adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat in the 58th century is fast-moving, and so is Striker II. Based on the award-winning Command Decision miniature rules, Striker II allows rapid play which replicates the rapid tempo and quick reactions of advanced technology warfare. These straight-forward rules allow players to concentrate on the mental dilemmas of tactics and command, not the interpretation of complicated rules mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Striker II is more than just rules, it is also an extensive source of military hardware and organizations-from the jeeps and tracked vehicles of Wilds units to the speeders and gray tanks of a Reformation Coalition Marine Brigade. Striker II also includes tables of organization and equipment listings for some of the most important military units from Traveller's long history: Zhondai Lift Infantry Battalions and Commando Groupments, Imperial Marine Task Forces, Imperial Guard Regiments, and the legendary 4518th Lift Infantry Regiment- &amp;quot;The Duke of Regina's Own Huscarls.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Striker II provides the full science fiction combat experience with rules on orbital bombardment, drop troops, anti-missle fire control, planetary environment, and orbital superiority. Campaign rules allow a sophisticated strategic gaming experience by adding the effects of combat engineers, maintenance, and quality of food and medical care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Striker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
