			<description>ヴァンガード (Vanguard) is a Japanese trading card game published by Bushiroad. It was created in collaboration between Akira Itō (Yu-Gi-Oh! R), Satoshi Nakamura (Duel Masters), and Bushiroad president Takaaki Kidani. The game was also released in conjunction with a TV anime series, &amp;quot;カードファイト!! ヴァンガード&amp;quot; (Cardfight!! Vanguard).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players &amp;quot;ride&amp;quot; a unit as their Vanguard, which represents them on the board. They may also summon other units as Rear Guards to attack or support. The game is won by doing 6 points of damage to the opponent's Vanguard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As players attack, if they are using their vanguard they can &amp;quot;drive check&amp;quot; whereby they check the top card of their deck for &amp;quot;triggers&amp;quot; which increase power and have other effects, and add these cards to their hand. Triggers can also be revealed when players take damage to their vanguard by performing a &amp;quot;damage check&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, each player places their grade 0 starting vanguard face down in the &amp;quot;vanguard circle&amp;quot; and then draws 5 cards. They may return any number of cards to the deck and re-draw to form their starting hand, but only once. It's a good tactic to return trigger cards from your first hand as these are better utilised when drawn from the deck as part of a &amp;quot;drive check&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;damage check&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the players are done setting up their initial hand they determine who goes first (often, rock-paper-scissors is used for this) and then each turn follows the same turn order:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Stand up (only at the start of the game, and both players perform this action simultaneously whereby they flip over their vanguard)&lt;br/&gt;2. Stand and Draw&lt;br/&gt;3. Ride&lt;br/&gt;4. Call&lt;br/&gt;5. Attack&lt;br/&gt;6. Guard&lt;br/&gt;7. Drive Check&lt;br/&gt;8. Damage Check&lt;br/&gt;9. (more attacks? Go back to 5)&lt;br/&gt;10. Turn end - change to other player and go back to 2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's worth noting that strategically, taking damage early in the game can be beneficial as you can use cards in the damage zone to &amp;quot;counter blast&amp;quot; (flip the cards over to activate special actions on certain units).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
