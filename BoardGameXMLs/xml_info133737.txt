			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mig Alley is part of the Wings at War series of wargames rules from Tumbling Dice. Mig Alley is designed for recreating Korean War air combat using Tumbling Dice's 1/600th scale aircraft models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games are designed to last around one or two hours. As the sky tends to be a lot less cluttered than the ground, games can be set up quickly and fewer models are required - making for a cheaper night out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any number of people can play. As the victory target is dependant on the size of a force, opposing sides don't have to be equally balanced, a smaller or less sophisticated mix of planes can defeat a larger or more advanced enemy by reaching their (lower) victory target first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each model represents an individual aircraft or balloon. Elevation is abstracted using 4 levels, and the game uses D6 and D3 (a d6 numbered 1,1,2,2,3,3) for combat resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
