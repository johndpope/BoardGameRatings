			<description>Game takes place on a 9 x 10 grid of circles; furthest row on either player's side of the board features circles filled with letters &amp;quot;C-H-A-C-H-A-C-H-A&amp;quot; and covered with game's checker pieces that have corresponding letters on top, each player having chosen a different side and color.  Players take turns placing three shoe pieces of their own color on the board, which will not move during the game and will help or hinder the players depending on ownership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then take turns moving lettered pieces, one at a time but with each piece needing to move five times (as the player says &amp;quot;Cha&amp;quot; with each step,) to get to a corresponding letter on the opposite side.  Pieces can move in any direction except diagonal and can jump, but do not capture or eliminate others.  First player to find a home for all their pieces on their opponent's side wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note:  the game does not have a publication date.  However, it features both &amp;quot;Hassenfeld Bros.&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Hasbro&amp;quot; names listed as publisher, and the &amp;quot;cha-cha-cha&amp;quot; was first known at some point in the 1950's or 1960's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
