			<description>By keeping track of, and selecting, the speed of your ship you will move around an imaginable arena for space combat, where the galaxy's aces settle the score! But watch out - if you crash into the walls or any of the arenas obstacles, your ship will be hard to control. Goal of the game: To kill your opponents!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* As many Icehouse stashes as possible, a minimum of 1 per player&lt;br/&gt;    * Tiled/checkered playing area, such as a chessboard, but the game has been optimized for a 8*8*8 board.&lt;br/&gt;    * A way of indicating height if not enough pyramids are available (8-sided dice are perfect)&lt;br/&gt;    * A way of indicating speed (again, 8-sided or even 6-sided (as you don't want to go very much faster than 6 in most cases) dice are good)&lt;br/&gt;    * Markers to use for obstacles and power-ups, such as coins (different values of coin can be different power-ups) or Icehouse pyramids.&lt;br/&gt;    * Several 8-sided die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Icehouse Pieces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
