			<description>Windows versions of the game were an evolution of the DOS versions of TRACON and TRACON II&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to more sector charts, sound became more seamless than in DOS versions. It was easy to turn on sound without being distracted by the game freezing as each sound played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another addition to the program was the existence of VFR general aviation pilots in simulations. In many simulations, a number of VFR icons criss-cross the screen. Occasionally, one would call, &amp;quot;Cherokee five five zulu with you at three thousand five hundred.&amp;quot; The player would have to ask the VFR pilot to squawk their transponder, making the VFR craft's icon bloom on the screen. This separated the calling aircraft's icon from other identical VFR icons on the screen. Within a short time frame, the player had to attach the correct ident (55Z) to the VFR aircraft. The squawked icon would only bloom for a few seconds. If too much time passed, the player had to repeat the request and try again. It becomes essential to have the sound working properly if you want to handle this VFR traffic , else it becomes necessary to scroll up/down your dialogue window to see the calls made by any VFR entering so that you may call them with their proper call sign or you can not identify them and consequently control them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is worth mentioning that in this TRACON for Windows version the player is given the option to work in TRACON or RAPCON but under RAPCON we simply see a classic Terminal Area Control over some military sectors, without any apparent possibility of reverting to the Precision Approach Radar position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Windows version of Tracon can be run directly under Linux by means of the Wine application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tracon II&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
