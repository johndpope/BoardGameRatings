			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1522 the wizard Darling foresaw the destruction of the Earth in the 21st century by the demon Willchungus. He summoned his travelling sphere and set out to defeat the demon, but Willchungus captured the sphere and teleported it inside a pinball machine. You're the pinball player and you must help Darling escape the machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enchant is a pinball simulation game. Players must defeat each of the nine levels to be able to complete the game. Each level is a different layout and has a different objective to complete. Once the level is cleared, an opening appears on top of the screen leading on to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
