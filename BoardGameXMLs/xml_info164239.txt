			<description>Rescue Shot, known as Rescue Shot Bubibo (レスキューショット ブービーぼー) in Japan, is a 3D light gun video game for the PlayStation console which was released in Japan and Europe in 2000. The game is non-violent and aimed at younger players, the game is more forgiving of poor accuracy than others in the genre. Players watch over the game's hero, Bo, as he absentmindedly makes his way through each location, dealing with enemies and manoeuvering him past dangers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Rescue Shot&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
