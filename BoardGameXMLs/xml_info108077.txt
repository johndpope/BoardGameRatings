							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Victorian Gamer</name>
									
			<description>In 19th Century Britain, sports were invented and developed to provide the idle rich with a means of betting large sums of money against each other. In The Victorian Gamer you are one of the idle rich.&lt;br/&gt;No aristocrat worthy of his name would have been without a fast running footman or a stable boy who was a particularly able jockey. He would put up his &amp;lsquo;man&amp;rsquo; against another noble&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;man&amp;rsquo; for an agreed sum. The sport was incidental; it was the outcome that counted, with the winner taking all. And of course, a whole new industry of side betting with bookies quickly emerged.&lt;br/&gt;The Victorian Gamer mirrors this era. There are three different events &amp;ndash; running, rowing and horseracing - each one having its own unique gameplay. In addition, players can make bets against each other and/or with the bookie. And furthermore, to add a bit of extra spice there are three differently numbered dice to form the odds and affect the outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;In short, there are three different races, two ways of betting, but only one winner. For friends and  family with even the tiniest element of a competitive streak, The Victorian Gamer will provide hours of fun, not to mention a few squabbles, huffs  and sulks. Warning &amp;ndash; NOT A GAME FOR BAD LOSERS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
