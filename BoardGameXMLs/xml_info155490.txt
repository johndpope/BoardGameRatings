			<description>The players move their cars around the game board to win or lose play money. Each Player gets 6 black cards. If he gets on a space for which he has the corresponding black card, he draws a new one, if not he has to tell the other players the meaning of the pictured traffic sign on this space. If he can not do that, he has to pay 50 &amp;quot;Buck Mark&amp;quot;. On some spaces the players have to draw red (bad luck) or green (good luck) cards. If a player wins money, he can buy more cars (not the game pieces, but virtual cars, which are documented on a piece of paper). &lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all red or green cards are used up. The player with the most cars and most valuable cards (black and green)wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
