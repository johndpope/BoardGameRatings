			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On this Print N&amp;rsquo;Play Board Game your goals are simple: Acquire a Treasures/Loot, fight Villains and discover/explore the MAX number of Locations on Lanterns.&lt;br/&gt; As a little treat we decided to make the cards from this board game 100% compatible with the others upcoming Lanterns products, but for now the Lanterns: Red Dawn is designed to be a Stand Alone Game, so that is our focus today.&lt;br/&gt; What you'll need:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Two (2) Dice [regular D6 dice];&lt;br/&gt;     Some tokens (this can be anything, from pennies to popcorn. But we suggest something non-edible);&lt;br/&gt;     The playing cards:&lt;br/&gt;         4 Characters Cards (Jessica, lvl 1-2; Simon lvl 1-2; Bleez, lvl 1-2 &amp;amp; Krunn, lvl 1-2)&lt;br/&gt;         12 Sectors Cards (Locations Cards)&lt;br/&gt;         36 Tactics Cards (9 Characters Cards, 9 Moments Cards, 9 Tackles Cards &amp;amp; 9 Dilemmas Cards)&lt;br/&gt;         9 Prize Cards (7 Relics Cards &amp;amp; 2 No Luck Blank Cards)&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lanterns: Red Dawn is a board game which you control a Lantern in a journey to gather 7 Relics on Lanterns to save the world from the impending doom. Your enemies are other Lanterns, you may even find a mirror image of your own, curse those Technomancers and their cloning, that run for the possession of the 7 Relics to control the world of Lanterns.&lt;br/&gt; You have your Lantern in play at the start of the game. He&amp;rsquo;s your main force. You also have a 25 &amp;ndash; card deck minimum. Your Deck contains the various resources to which you may have access: Tackles, Moments, Companions, and other stuff.&lt;br/&gt; You start the game laying down some cards that will act like your Sectors board. Then you choose some Dilemmas cards and place them beneath them. Next you'll place some prize cards beneath them. Then you'll be ready to start.&lt;br/&gt; Roll a dice and place your character on the respective Sector card. Then you'll turn that card and see if you have all the card skills (the necessary card skills will be printed on the Sectors cards). If you meet all the skill you may see what the card Dilemma card says. if you manage to survive the Dilemma card. You may see what your Prize card is.&lt;br/&gt; You win the game when you gather the 7 Relics or when you defeat your entire opponent&amp;rsquo;s on the board!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
