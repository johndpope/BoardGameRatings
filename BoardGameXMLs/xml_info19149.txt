			<description>Poison apples, beanstalks, and circumlocution for two or more storytellers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: To guess words chosen by the other players from a fairy tale while keeping yours secret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Need: Pencil and paper for each player&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once everyone has pencils, paper, and magic beans, choose a fairy tale for the game. Once a fairy tale has been selected, each player needs to write down five words commonly associated with that tale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to get the other players to say their secret words by asking questions and through general conversation. Once the game has started, you must not speak your own secret words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, pick a person and ask him a question about the story. He has to answer it. Remember, not only is your subject not allowed to use his or her secret words, but you aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to use your secret words either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of your turn, you may instead pass your turn. If all of the players in the game but one pass their turns in one round, then the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, jot down what you think each player&amp;rsquo;s secret words are. Take turns declaring your secret word guesses. Score one point for every correct guess. Score a point for every one of your secret words that no other player guessed. The player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
