			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a short supplement for the Covert Ops role-playing game. It can be used with the setting provided in brief within the core rulebook (SECTOR) or can be used in any setting you desire. Since this supplement is settingless, it uses the generic term &amp;ldquo;Command&amp;rdquo; to refer to the player operatives&amp;rsquo; organization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this supplement, add a little bit of sci to your fi and embrace a shadow world where cybernetic implants are possible. These pages add cybernetics to your espionage and paramilitary fun. Turn your spy into a super spy, or your soldier into a super soldier, with abilities that make him more than human.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book takes a categorical approach to defining implants. It breaks them down into prosthetics (fully functional replacements for normal body parts), bionics (the lite stuff powered off your body's own bioelectric field), and cybernetics (the heavy stuff, requiring a power supply to function). Beyond this, it breaks them down into three categories of minor, moderate, and major. In addition to defining a cost breakdown, this categorization makes it easy for GMs who want to limit the amount and type of implants available in his setting. One GM might permit only light and moderate prosthetics and bionics in his game, while another might allow full cybernetic conversions if the operative can afford it and wants to pay the price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Implants do mess with your body's harmony and bioelectric field, and some would say your soul.  Be careful with how much of your humanity you trade in for machine; cybersickness can debilitate you, and if your heavier implants lose power you&amp;rsquo;ll be needing extraction in a hurry!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
