			<description>How is your sense of direction? Would you be able to find your way out of a tight situation under pressure? Try your luck while you&amp;rsquo;re being pursued here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pursued is a new bite-sized web-based game by Nemesys Games! We&amp;rsquo;ve created an integrated experience with Google Maps to give players an exploration-based thrill ride.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You've been taken without warning and emerge in an unknown place. A friend is trying to help you escape when you call, but you must use your surroundings to figure out where you are before they can pick you up! It's a race against time as you&amp;rsquo;re being pursued by your captors!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay includes 15 tailored levels and after completion, community levels are also available to create and play for everyone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
