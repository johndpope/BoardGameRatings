			<description>&amp;quot;My code name is Chronos, and now you are my Agents. The threads of the time have been torn and mysterious artifacts suddenly appeared in the world. The most dangerous areas of the metropolis are in turmoil. The Chronomancer is destroying the Reality, it is your task to defeat her!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A team of fighters and experts is looking for OOPART - Out Of Place ARTifacts, and is ready to clash with the worst criminals of the Planet. That group of agents has dared defy the Chronomancer to restore the Reality and Time's order&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chronomancer is a cooperative board game, for 2-6 players with a 1-3 hrs/game duration, set in metropolitan areas in hot-spot countries all around the world. Each player controls an Agent of the Chrono Team and has to complete the Mission of the game by recovering weapons, valuables and ancient artifacts. Moving through a scenario that simulates a dangerous city, Agents will fight against mercenaries, evil bosses, powerful creatures that came from the past, and sometimes with the Chronomancer too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Different kinds of action are available for each Agent, such as melee, fire-arm attacks, technological tools and bombing raids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main feature of Chronomancer is the modular design of the board that allows creating countless environments and collision situations, offering a new game experience at every time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the missions and on the related objective to be achieved, Chronomancer also suggests a multiple level game structure and an evolving plot. All the Agents get involved in the main quest that must be completed for the final Victory. Each Agent can earn honor points during the fulfillment of the mission, but will also have his/her own agenda of personal goals to be reached. If the main quest has been resolved, the Agent with the greater amount of honor points wins over everyone. Moreover, by following the numerical order of the main missions (Mission 1, Mission 2, etc.), you will discover the Chronomacer's plans, living a long adventure game by game. But you can also pick missions at random and play them on their own, with different sets and enemies every time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A modular board, 10 mission, 8 characters, 4 bosses an several time themed creature and characters from the past grant an always new gaming experience and great longevity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
