			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world had come to an end, but we hardly noticed, driving mile after mile through places people forgot a long time ago. When we finally found civilization, it was gone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summer 1976. Edgar Voorhees and his family decided to travel across America to visit the Grand Canyon. But at some point in their travels, the world came screeching to a halt. Soulless creatures had risen from the earth, replacing the living with the unliving. Undead had taken over most of the United States. But for those living in the rural and forgotten parts of America, the news hadn&amp;rsquo;t hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet. The family had stopped somewhere in Southeastern Colorado when the news came on the radio. It was choppy and unclear. &amp;ldquo;Something about zombies,&amp;rdquo; Edgar muttered. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s a zombie?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: The game works best if the players assume the world has never heard of zombies, or zombies in popular fiction. This adds to the suspense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
