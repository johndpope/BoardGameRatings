							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Maori Wars</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Card game for 2 players. Theme: New Zealand Maori Wars 1840-1872. One player is the Pakehas (White Men). The other player is the Native Maori.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a set of 19 Land Tokens and two custom decks of cards - a Maori Deck and a Pakehas Deck. There are nine different types of cards, each named for aspects of the conflict (Leaders, Tactics, Weapons, Politics, Morale, Defenses, etc.) Each card is ranked with a Strength value from 2 to 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each hand the players battle for the possession of a single Land Token. Tokens are won by playing a set of cards having a higher total Strength value than those played by the opponent. The first player to acquire ten Land Tokens wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
