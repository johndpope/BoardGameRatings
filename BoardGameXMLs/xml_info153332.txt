							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bridge &amp; Towers</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a map depicting a small section of a settled bridge, much like the London Bridge in medieval times.  It is a section of bridge crossing a river with tunnels, towers, and gates set at regular intervals.  In addition to those elements, the denizens of the city have settled it, building businesses and homes that extend over the edge of the bridge and are only held up by the balance of the second and third stories, or by thick wooden beams planted firmly in the bottom of the river.  There are day and night versions of this map, with the night versions being highly useful for thieving missions where shadows are essential to the success or failure of the mission.  This map could also be used for assassination missions, a straight up street brawl, or perhaps your players are confronted in this street by a recurring nemesis who doesn't want them forgetting about him or her.  As with anything in these types of games, What you do with your tools is limited only by your imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     35&amp;quot; x 46&amp;quot; in size.  Just short of 3 feet by 4 feet when printed out.  Perfectly sized for most gaming tables!&lt;br/&gt;     HEX and SQUARE grids for each type of map listed below, as well as a NO GRID version for people that prefer to set their own scale.  Grid sizes are 1&amp;quot; = 5' of gaming space.&lt;br/&gt;     Full Color Versions &amp;ndash; This is a printer intensive, full color version of this map. &lt;br/&gt;     Black and White versions &amp;ndash; A black and white version, meant to be the least printer intensive.&lt;br/&gt;     Day and Nighttime lighting - No matter what time you set your adventure, this map has you covered, though the night version may turn out a little dark on lower quality printers.&lt;br/&gt;     VTT map of the daytime lighting included for online players that prefer a smaller map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
