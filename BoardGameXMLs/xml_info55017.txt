			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Modern20, the streamlined cinematic OGL game you've been waiting for!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern20 uses only six 20-level core classes but allows for a full range of character options with backgrounds and occupations as well as over 150 feats, allowing you to create any character, including re-creating those from your favorite movies and tv shows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern20 combat rules make for a decidedly non-fantasy feel to your combats. No longer is the way to win attacking as many times in a round as possible. Carefully lining up that perfect headshot is now just as viable a way to take your opponent down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Modern20 equipment list covers weapons from the entire 20th century. Combined with classes based on party roles (occupations are used to establish archetype), you can create characters for 100 years of adventuring excitement, from WWII to VietNam to the Cold War to the modern war on terror!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
