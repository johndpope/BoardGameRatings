			<description>&amp;quot;Major Stryker is a 2D vertical scrolling shooter game written for DOS, by Apogee Software (now 3D Realms).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was originally distributed as shareware. It consists of three episodes, with only the first episode distributed as shareware, and the rest available commercially. The episodes are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Lava Planet&lt;br/&gt;    * Arctic Planet&lt;br/&gt;    * Desert Planet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features PC Speaker and Sound Blaster sounds, and the AdLib music is similar in style to Bobby Prince's other songs. The game uses EGA graphics and draws three backgrounds (&amp;quot;triple-parallax scrolling&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three difficulty levels, each of which has drastically different levels of powerups, enemies, and enemy fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only named characters are the titular hero and Fleet Admiral Yoshira, a very attractive, often flirtatious woman who briefs the character between levels, and seems to be in love with him as well.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Major Stryker , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
