			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realmz is a roleplaying game system set in a fantasy world made by Tim Philips and published by Fantasoft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game allows the player to explore a pre-loaded scenario with a party of custom characters. A party could comprise of a maximum of 6 characters. Characters grew more powerful by gaining levels and through the accumulation of magical items. Characters came in a large number of 'races' and 'castes'. The game was heavily influenced by RPG's like Dungeons and Dragons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realmz came with one playable scenario: The City of Bywater. Additional official scenarios, made by Tim Phillips and other authors could be added as they were released and then fully unlocked via paying for a registration code. There are 11 official scenarios but a good deal of third-party scenarios also exist, built using Fantasoft's scenario development kit Divinity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realmz was released first for the Apple Mac (1994) before being released for Windows (1999). Orginally the game was shareware and could be unlocked via paying for a registration code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As of 2008 Realmz has been made freeware, although this does not appear to include all scenarios. Realmz is no longer officially supported and new official scenario registration codes cannot currently be purchased.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
