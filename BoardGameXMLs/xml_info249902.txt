			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THEY SAID IT WAS GOING TO BE A SIMPLE JOB.&lt;br/&gt;Just shift 40 tons of superconductors to Curtis Outpost in Ross 1057.&lt;br/&gt;What could go wrong? Except for stopping to rescue orphans from a burning ship, being held up by anti-corporate freedom fighters, discovering a banned alien animal amongst the cargo pods, repairing your sparking Frame Shift Drive, discovering that your cargo is actually a narcotics shipment and fighting off a corrupt police force. Anyway you made it. Is now a good time to tell you that your buyer is dead and that the station has been set to explode?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who&amp;rsquo;d be a trucker? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Get more space! Buy the Boa Mk III, Cobra Mk IV and Keelback to shift that precious cargo.&lt;br/&gt;    Trouble with pirates? Send ship launched fighters after them, such as the F63 Condor, Tai Pan and the GU97 Imperial fighter.&lt;br/&gt;    Use the enhanced trading rules for more commodities, more markets and more profit!&lt;br/&gt;    Brand new Trading Missions with deadly twists that will challenge your players to the limit.&lt;br/&gt;    Encounter tables for civilised space. Rescue your fellow traders or be attacked from within your own ship.&lt;br/&gt;    More character backgrounds, equipment and Karma Capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
