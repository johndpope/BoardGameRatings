			<description>Three-Card Monte is played one of two ways.  The first method is a children's game in which three cards or objects are laid out face-up.  The cards or objects are then turned face down and scrambled.  The challenge is then to pick out where one of the objects is now positioned.  It's flipped over and the guess is either correct or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variations of this &amp;quot;honest&amp;quot; version are now commonly shown on the big screens of sporting events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;confidence&amp;quot; version of Three-Card Monte actually uses 4 cards.  The dealer uses a palming technique to make a card switch, so that the player can't find the correct card.  This method is a rigged game, which often involves the use of a shill to create the illusion the game can be won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
