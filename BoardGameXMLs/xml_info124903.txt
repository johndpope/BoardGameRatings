							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shock Beetle</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shock beetle is a small yet rather dangerous beast. It is a 3 foot long multicolored beetle with a wide row of feelers descending from its mouth and two large tusklike horns. It stands about 2 feet high. Shock beetles are aggressive and predatory, having few natural enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their main feature of note is the sizable electrical charge that builds up within them. This charge functions as both an offensive and defensive weapon, affecting enemies that touch them as well as those bitten by the beetle. Though diffi cult to work with, they are highly prized by alchemists and mages as a supply of electrical power for their experiments. Also, for some unknown reason, paretiophages (page 151 in Monster Geographica: Forest) seem to enjoy their company as pets and watchdogs. Combat Shock beetles are lazy hunters. They like to hide themselves in cracks or around blind corners and then lie in wait for prey. When a suitable creature approaches, they jump out to attack. If a beetle has not been noticed by the time prey approaches within 10 feet of its hiding place, it surprises its prey with a leap attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
