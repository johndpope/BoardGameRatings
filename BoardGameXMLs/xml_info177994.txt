			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; UNAVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has officially been announced by the publisher or developer, but has not yet been released and made available for purchase. Therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please do not submit images for it, nor add new releases. Press Kits are an exception and a maximum of six can be added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shenmue III was formally a canceled game for the Dreamcast created by Sega. Various unconfirmed reasons for its delay include budget issues, poor sales of Shenmue II, and creative differences between Yu Suzuki and the more conservative management Sega installed. Shenmue III has been announced and cancelled at least twice. It was originally set to contain Shenmue I and II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a successful KickStarter in 2015, Shenmue 3 has started development again and is partially funded by Sony. Shenmue 3 has been created for the PC and PlayStation 4 and built in Unreal 4. It will will have familiar elements from its predecessors and new fight mechanics to achieve a new level of interactive storytelling. The story continues as Ryo and Shenhua travel farther into enemy territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
