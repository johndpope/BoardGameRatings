							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chicago Gangsters</name>
									
			<description>Back of Book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your best friend murdered, your modest moon-shining racket smashed to smithereens, your life in danger, there's only one thing to do... head north to Chicago, America's crime capital. It's the Roaring Twenties, a time of much gaiety, but there is a more sinister side to life in the city. While socialites drink, dance the Charleston, and try to forget the horror of the First World War, shady figures deal and double-deal, struggle for power and kill if necessary. This is the height of organised crime's power and influence and Chicago is the hub of the empire.&lt;br/&gt;With just a few dollars in your pocket, a couple of contacts, and a ruthless and determined streak, you have got to make it big time. Do you set up as an independent operator or do you go to work for one of the big crime families and work your way up? These and many other decisions will determine your progress in the world of crime. In this game book, you are the hero. A die, a pencil and an eraser are all you need to set off on your adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
