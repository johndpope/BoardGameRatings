							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mad Mines</name>
									
			<description>Advertisement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Force has laid siege to your planet! An ever tightening force field is being applied around your planet space. Mad mines are being sown into this ever diminishing space. As their mad, fast action speeds up, the situation becomes more difficult. Can they all be destroyed? Will you survive? Only your quick response and fast reflexes will tell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your mission is to explode mines and destroy aliens. Each wave starts with a group of space mines floating above a barrier at the top of the screen (this barrier gets lower with each wave). Your ship moves back and forth across the bottom of the screen shooting at the mines. When a mine is hit, an alien is released and it flies down towards your ship. Avoid the aliens and shoot them for points. Aliens will drop bombs and bounce back from the bottom of the screen to remain in the playfield until you shoot them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
