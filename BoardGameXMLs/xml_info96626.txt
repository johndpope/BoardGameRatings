							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Assault on Icecrown Citadel</name>
									
			<description>From the World of Warcraft TCG site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experience raiding content through the World of Warcraft Trading Card Game. Play the role of a hero as your storm Icecrown Citadel with your friends against the evil that has plagued Northrend for too long. Or, play as that evil and conquer the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This four-player game has everything you and three friends need to play all in the box. Play as Highlord Tirion Fordring, Lady Jaina Proudmoore, or Queen Sylvanas Windrunner and battle against the Lich King! Each player takes a deck, and the three heroes of Azeroth team-up to free the land from the threats of Icecrown Citadel. If the 3-on-1 seems unfair, know that the Lich King raid deck has some of the most powerful cards you've ever seen. He's no mere mortal! Plus, each deck comes with the hero's legendary weapon: the Ashbringer, Staff of Antonidas, Frostmourne, and Deathwhisper. The decks also feature new art for Fire Blast, Frostbolt, Counterspell, Multi-Shot, Redemption, Hammer of Justice, and others!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cryptozoic has streamlined the raid deck experience, making it far more friendly to new players. There are no new rules to learn; each player takes his or her turn just as they would in a normal game of World of Warcraft TCG. The included rulebook ensures that even completely green recruits can jump in the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three raiding decks easily convert into tournament-legal Core decks as well. Just replace the hero card, remove the legendary weapon, and you can battle at your local Core Constructed or Battlegrounds event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each four-player game comes packaged with an Assault on Icecrown Citadel Treasure Pack, and the Treasure Packs are sold separately as well. There are 20 uncommons, 7 rares, and 3 epics in the set. Each pack contains 9 foil cards (8 uncommons and 1 rare or 1 epic) unleashing never-seen-before allies, abilities, quests, and equipment cards into the World of Warcraft TCG card pool. Find Muradin Bronzebeard, High Overlord Saurfang, and Highlord Tirion Fordring as new allies to join your party. Recruit the best of Northrend before you go back to the mainland. You also have the chance to open Loot cards from Worldbreaker: Mottled Drake, Grim Campfire, and Landro's Lil XT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
