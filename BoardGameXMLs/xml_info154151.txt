							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Supermodel Slapfest</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six supermodels are trapped in a building with a whiny fashion designer and a hunky handyman... and a murderer out to get them all! Sounds like the teaser summary for a slasher film, but it's actually the subject of the latest supplement for ROLF!: The Rollplaying Game of Big Dumb Fighters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dangerously close to being a real adventure (as opposed to the usual stuff where characters meet, characters kick each other into oblivion), this 10-page product features new Combat Maneuvers, new Stuff (both Armor and Weapons), eight pre-generated player characters, as well as the maniac who is trying to kill them. Well, who probably will kill them if the egomaniacal supermodels don't kill each other first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an added feature, there's a system for secretly making one of the &amp;quot;victims&amp;quot; the killer--just like in the slasher flicks where there has to be a &amp;quot;Big Reveal&amp;quot;--and no one knows who the murderer is until the time is right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
