			<description>The goal of the game is to capture the opponent miniatures (cowboys or indians). The players start with 6 figures from their camp. They can set up barriers on certain marked spaces to hinder the movement of their opponents. Figures are captured, if an opponent figure gets on the same space. Captured figures are imprisoned in the camp of the capturer. They may be freed if a figure of their color reaches this camp. The winner is the player who has captured the most opponents when when the first player has lost all his figures (short version) or the player who captures the last remaining opponent (long version).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
