			<description>As idiot uncles attending a family gathering in Drunk Uncles, a press-your-luck card game, you must get as many of your terrible opinions off of your chest as possible before you wear out the welcome of your fair-minded family. Players draft dice to determine their tolerance level and carefully play from their hand hoping to duck under the judgement of their family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In game terms, players each start with a hand of seven cards and a d4, d6 and d10 is placed in a shared pool (The Bar) for each player; cards range from 1-10 in four suits with three ?!?!? cards in each suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a round, each player completes one turn. On a turn, a player takes up to three dice from The Bar, rolls them to determine the current Tolerance value, then plays as many cards as desired from their hand as long as each card is less than the Tolerance value. If a player has no such cards, they can draw the top card and play it; if it's equal to or higher than Tolerance, they bust and lose all their cards. If they play a card equal to 8 or higher, opponents can play as many ?!?!? cards as they want of the same suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all cards have been played, the player scores points equal to the number of cards played multiplied by the number of dice rolled, then subtracts ten points for each ?!?!? card played. Finally, the active player refills their hand to seven cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each player has had a turn, return all dice to The Bar, then start a new round. When the last card has been drawn from the deck, finish the round. Whoever has the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
