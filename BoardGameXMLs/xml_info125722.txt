							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ooze Pits of Jonas Gralk</name>
									
			<description>From publishers Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Where have the 3rd born of Croaker&amp;rsquo;s Bend gotten to?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once again the mysteries of the sunken city have called to the desperate souls of the Great City. As the confusion of the sending fades, adventurers find themselves calf-deep in muck on the borders of a rustic village. The local folk seem friendly enough, but the relentless croaking issuing from the swamp eats away at any sense of calm. One begins to wonder: Why does every home show signs of mourning? And who is this Jonas Gralk that all seem to mention with dark suspicion?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for 0-level adventurers, The Ooze Pits of Jonas Gralk introduces adventures to the colorful inhabitants of Croaker&amp;rsquo;s Bend. Could the folk of the village possibly be as kindly as they seem, or are they masking dark secrets? What dangers lurk in the swamps surrounding the village, and why do the children of the hamlet stare out into the mists with blank eyes and empty smiles? And where has the town&amp;rsquo;s mortician Jonas Gralk and every 3rd born member of the community disappeared to? Answers will be discovered in The Ooze Pits of Jonas Gralk!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
