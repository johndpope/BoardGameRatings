			<description>Hounds of War is a standardized skirmishing miniatures rules system which allows the players (with maximum flexibility during the CREATION phase) to be able to take ANY 25-30mm figures, assign them the game values the players WANT, and be able to bring them into play. With Hounds of War you will be able to pit World War II Nazi Storm Troopers against your favorite Goblin Hoards, or even Star Wars&amp;copy; Storm Troopers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a stand-alone set of rules, so no other rules are necessary for play. In addition,  you WILL need your own miniatures, a LOT of 10-sided dice (d10), marking chits, 3D terrain, rulers marked in inches, and your imagination to play this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of being a &amp;quot;you-go-I-go&amp;quot; turn sequence, an initiative deck is used  and cards assigned to individual units to determine when units perform actions are performed in a turn. This creates a fast paced game in which players are constantly active.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
