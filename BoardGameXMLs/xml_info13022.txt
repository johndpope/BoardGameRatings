			<description>Based on the classic game show which ran from 1963-69, the object is to guess the name of a person, place, or thing by means of incomplete sentences in which the missing last word is the clue...and that is the word you don't say!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first team to get three points wins $100 and plays the Bonus Board, where the player has to guess the subject based on clues hidden under three lines. $300 is awarded for only using one line, $200 for two lines, and $100 for three lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
