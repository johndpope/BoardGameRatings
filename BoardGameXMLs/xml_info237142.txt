							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Symbaroum: Abilities &amp; Powers</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your friend at the table! This digital version of the Symbaroum Ability and Power Cards features the level descriptions of all abilities and mystical powers included in the Symbaroum Core Rulebook and the Advanced Player&amp;rsquo;s Guide, plus three new ones. The 119 cards are primarily meant to be used by players, for easy access to the abilities and powers of their player characters. However, the Game Master may also make good use of them &amp;ndash; in order to keep track of non-player characters or as a basis for rapidly crating random encounters. However you choose to use them, we hope that the ability and power cards will make playing Symbaroum even more of a joy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This digital version of the Ability &amp;amp; Power card deck includes two files - one PDF intended to be printed, with 8 cards per page and a minimum of color; one PDF in full color with one card per page, perfect for viewing on a screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
