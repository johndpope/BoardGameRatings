			<description>A combination memory and race game. Make sure you find the path through the jungle the fastest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 36 tiles are randomly placer face down on the board, and the 4 playing pieces are placed in each their own corner. Players take turns trying to find pairs. If no pair is found the tiles are turned back face down, otherwise the tiles are removed and a path through the jungle is formed. After each turn a player may move his playing piece as far as possible through the cleared paths. First to reach to opposite corner wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also an advanced game where snakes on the tiles can be place to block opponents from moving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
