							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Awalim</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this world of wonder and mystery, there are some who seek to amuse and entertain with their bodies, in the art known as dance. In lands beyond the seas and over the mountains, there are some who have developed the art of supernatural expression to an art, which allows one to not only emulate nature&amp;rsquo;s brace, but embody it. These are the awalim, and while their veils and skin-baring clothes seem to make them out to be cowards and noncombatants, their might is greater than any who might defy them. Originally just pleasuredancers in decadent courts, their absorption of skills from encountering the most skilled beings in history created a subcaste of skilled and beautiful performers, ready for anything to please their masters- and themselves. Awalim tap into ancient customs of propitiating mysterious spirits, animal totems, and magnifying their own will-to-power to achieve feats of daring unparalleled in the field of performance art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 20-level class for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
