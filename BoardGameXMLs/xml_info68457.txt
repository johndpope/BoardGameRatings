			<description>This boardgame includes 56 pictures of British kings and queens from Egbert (died 839), the first English king, to Victoria (1819&amp;ndash;1901).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are provided with a Card, containing nine Letters, nine Numbers, two Crosses and one Blank, which are to be cut up on the lines with a pair of scissors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player, on drawing a number, is to place his letter on the same number in the Game. When it is his turn to draw another, he adds them together and advances his letter to that number which they make when so added, reading as before, and observing any directions which may be given him. But if he draw a cross, he is to draw again, till he obtain a number, which number is to be deducted from, instead of added to his former station, and his letter moved back accordingly. Each card to be returned to the bag after drawing. Whoever draws a blank, remains at his former number. After each player has drawn once, the boardgame is to be continued in the same manner, passing the bag round, till someone makes up the exact number 151, who wins the Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
