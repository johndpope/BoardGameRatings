			<description>Fourth in the Gloranathan Classics series. This book reprints&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Borderlands Campaign pack&lt;br/&gt;2) Runemasters supplement&lt;br/&gt;3) Plunder supplement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included is material from Nomad Gods, the Runequest Companion, Wyrms Footprints and Pegasus magazine along with over 60 new pieces of art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;You Bet...&lt;br/&gt;You bet a lot when you left your home and went adventuring. you coul dhold yur own with a sword, and you knew your way around one of the not-so-nice local hot spots, but you weren't prepared to be called &amp;quot;stranger&amp;quot;, and you had never actually seen a troll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You skirmished, and fought pitched battles. Your skills and confidence grew. Now the jobs for hired swords are few, and though you're still hungry for glory and riches and honor, right now you'd settle for a meal...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately, good men are needed to help civilize a new domain - that may mean steady meals and reliable friends for a hungry, lonely mercenary. Seven scenarios of varying complexity will test his skills and wits, and his abilities to fight, guard, investigate, and explore will be crucial to his success. If he survives, he'll be well-seasoned, ready for anything in Glorantha.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prax is a wilderness. Duke Raus is out to tame a corner of it for himself. Join him at Fort Rone and earn fame and fortune by completing the seven deadly missions he has for you. Great rewards, perhaps even the Rome Sword itself, are yours for the taking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This campaign scenario pack provides everything needed to referee a Runequest campaign along the River of Cradles, a fertile valley separating the devastation of Vulture's Country and the wretched chaparral of Prax. The campaign is intended for intermediately skilled characters. Background, history, and regional details are included: the employer, the different tribal peoples in the area, the creatures and monsters (ducks to dinosaurs, whirlvishes to wraiths), and area specific magic items. The range of encounters is sizable, including the deadly Eternal Battle, a time-warped holdover form the Gods War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mercenaries earn their pay in Prax!&lt;br/&gt;Runemasters details 45 Rune Lords, Rune Priests, and Rune Lord-Priests of the 15 cults surveyd in Cults of Prax. Each character is completely individualized, experienced, equipped with spells, treasurdes, bound spirits, and so on. They form a valuable collection for referees who need Rune-level characters as NPCs. This is much more than just a collection of statistics. It also discusses how Runemasters are created, and about the logic of their growth, how each type of runemaster should be played, what their retinue (if any) should be, how a referee can organize his NPCs with coherent melee tactics and team strategy, etc. They are the most informative notes of their kind ever published about the rational play of strong Runequest characters. Included as an added bonus are the character histories, deleted from the original manuscript, but restored here over 25 years later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plunder gives detailed descriptions of many of Glorantha's magical treasures. Each has notes on physical appearance, relationship to various cults, extent of public knowledge of the item, history, procedure for making items that can be made, its powers, and its value. Surprise your adventurers with a gift of treasure. Also included are additional Plunder items by Rudy Kraft not found in the original.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
