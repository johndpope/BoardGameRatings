			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alone Against the Tide is a solo-play adventure designed to be run with no Keeper and only using the Call of Cthulhu 7th edition Quickstart rules. The scenario is designed for ease of use, and requires no preparation to pick up and play. The adventure itself takes place in the lakeside resort town of Esbury, Massachusetts. You, the player, are going to Esbury in the wake of the death of a Professor William Harris, who has left behind many questions as to his mysterious suicide, a grieving widow, and collection of rare and valuable antiquities. Whatever your business here, you will soon learn that maybe Esbury isn&amp;rsquo;t the best place for a vacation spot. When things take a violent and mysterious turn, you find yourself Alone Against the Tide...and with little hope of survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
