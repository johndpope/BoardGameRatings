			<description>The game of smarm, swag, and popped collars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a freshman in college. You want to get into the most Bro fraternity on campus, but how can you show up the other pledges?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Popped collars bro. Be the first person to sport a killer ten layered pop collars, and they'll have to let you into the fraternity over the other posers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you start the game draw five cards. On your turn you draw one card. You then can play one card, or attack once per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have slots for two hands, one chest, one head and your feet, and can accessorize each of those items. That's 5 slots. You can not wear more accessories then you have slots, unless a card says otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You win the game when you have 10 popped collars worn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
