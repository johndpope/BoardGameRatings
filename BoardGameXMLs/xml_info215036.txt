							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spell Wars: Collectible Card Game</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher: &amp;quot;NEW CCG From MediaStream Press: Spell Wars is a CCG like no other! It removes a lot of the annoyances of other games, with fast action and just enough luck and randomness to make it truly exciting! Use magic sources to put down summoning circles. Use summoning circles to draw forth minions from 7 different elements: Spirit, Air, Fire, Dark, Earth, Water, and Light. Attack and defend with your minions, using standard d6 dice. Empower your warriors with powerful buffs and enchantments. Strike down your enemies with curses and spells! Defeat your rivals with strategy, luck, and your dice-rolling skills! All you need is this book, some d6, and some counters. All the rules you need to play are included in this full-color book with 270 cards! Unlike other card games where you have to go buy pack after pack to get decent cards, they're all included here! No more tapping, no more waiting for the right card, no more watching the rich kid win because of rare cards, no more boring stats comparisons to watch monsters die... This is an innovative system with a LOT of fun updates to classic card games. Use dice to do combat, always have a hand of cards to play, and no more wasted mana and holding back. This is a SLUGFEST type battle. Check it out now!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
