							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wa, the Anime &amp; Manga RPG</name>
									
			<description>from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An exotic, collaborative, open-source, and action-oriented game designed from the ground up for anime-style storytelling and combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the wake of the fall of the Empire, the Succession Wars have claimed millions of lives. The once-bustling lands are gearing up for war, clan against clan, caste against caste, and man against spirit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wa (short for &amp;quot;Wasureimonogatari&amp;quot;) is an action-oriented, table-top role-playing-focused game set in a fantasy version of feudal Japan, where spirits, monsters, and kami are all very real.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wa is a table-top game in the tradition of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, Legend of the Five Rings, and Fate, but where it differs is that it focuses on the role-playing, storytelling aspect of table-top gaming rather than statistics or rules minutia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wa is built around the finest, most tried-and-true, sword-tested tropes from anime and manga. In Wa, you'll see beast people, katana-wielding samurai, ki-powered ninja, spiritually enlightened shugenja, ancient mountain hermits, and powerful blood ties that go back for millennia. Combat is explosive, quick, and merciless. Your heroes will master powers of your choosing, and wield them against a vast array of foes, from possessed paper lanterns to powerful samurai generals to conniving corrupt kami.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
