			<description>Schafk&amp;ouml;pfchen is an easy variation of Schafkopf, a trick-taking game popular in Austria and Bavaria. In each of the four colors of cards in the deck are six cards numbered 1-6; the deck also contains gray cards numbered 7-15, which are always trump. An additional trump color is determined each round by die roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, a player starts with eight cards in hand. The starting player plays a card, and the others have to follow the suit, if possible. The player with the higest card of the played color or a trump gets the trick. After eight tricks, players look at the cards they collected. Some of the cards show flowers, and the player with the most flowers scores 1 point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect 3 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
