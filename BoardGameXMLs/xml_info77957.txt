			<description>From the Publisher / Developer Website&lt;br/&gt;Gary Grigsby&amp;rsquo;s World At War&amp;trade; brings you to back to the dawn of the greatest and most terrible war the world has ever seen. The forces of the Axis, including Germany, Japan and Italy, face the might of France, Great Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union in the epic struggle of World War II. Starting with the blitzkrieg attack on France, the course of the war is determined by your actions as the leader of one or more major factions, opposed by human or computer players. As you play Gary Grigsby&amp;rsquo;s World At War&amp;trade;, the events of the war unfold around you through news reel reports covering both historical and hypothetical events, depending on how the war is going. As the United States, do you focus on Europe first or send more reinforcements to the Pacific, seeking an early defeat for Japan? As Germany, do you invade the Soviet Union in 1941 or prepare your forces to march into London? In Gary Grigsby&amp;rsquo;s World At War&amp;trade;, you have complete control over the production, research and military strategy for your side. At your disposal are the full air, land and sea forces of each power, with each unit rated in a variety of researchable areas. Build more tank divisions, improve your fighter planes or focus on strategic bombardment &amp;ndash; the choice is yours. More expensive units take longer to build and shortages in industry, resources or manpower can play havoc with your plans. Take command in this dynamic, turn-based strategy game of World War II that puts you in the role of some of the most legendary leaders of history. Two tutorials and several campaign scenarios let you learn the system quickly and start fighting the whole war or a smaller part of it. Make it happen in Gary Grigsby&amp;rsquo;s World at War&amp;trade;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
