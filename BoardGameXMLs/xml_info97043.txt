			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Necropolis 2350 Adventure Compendium 1 contains a fantastic set of adventures for the sci-fi horror RPG Necropolis 2350 and is based in a fictional 24th century. In these dark days, mankind, divided into two main camps, stands on the brink of extinction. The Third Reformation Church are locked in desperate battle against &amp;quot;undead&amp;quot; invaders known as the Rephaim. While the heroes of humanity use advanced weapons and can call upon the power of faith, the twisted Rephaim are masters of necromancy and wield vile technology created from living tissue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Long Sleep&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep in the Desert Something is stirring! An overdue routine communication from an archaeological team operating deep in the Ruber Desert requires investigation, and the Knights are given the task. What might have been a technical fault caused by recent solar storm activity turns out to be something far worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Snatch and Grab&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this adventure the Knights are ordered to secure unusual Rephaim specimens for scientific study. Alone in a hostile city, the Knights need to act quickly and quietly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Cardinal Error&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cardinal Vespasian, head of the Office of Agriculture, has been kidnapped by separatists seeking to join the Union of Corporations. To ensure a safe rescue, and make other kidnappers think twice about daring to use force against the Church and its officials, the Pope has personally ordered the Sacri Ordines to conduct a televised rescue mission. The orders for this quick adventure are brutally simple - rescue the prisoners, kill the kidnappers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three Short Adventures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When someone higher up the chain of command makes a mistake, it&amp;rsquo;s left to the Knights to appear live on the Church&amp;rsquo;s home-shopping channel to sell merchandize! Aiding another Preceptory, the Knights are assigned to walk the beat and police the streets. Have they got what it takes to deal with the public without resorting to violence? In the third adventure, a rescue mission leads to a terrifying discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Last Word&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ordo is launching a recruitment drive at the Shrine of St. Malachy, a famous visionary from Earth&amp;rsquo;s history, and the Knights are ordered to win over hearts and minds. In addition to the recruitment operation, the Knights must also liaise regarding security of the shrine with its permanent guardians, the militant nuns of the Sisters of Bradamante. What should be a quiet mission quickly breaks down into violence and mayhem. The theft of a precious relic by a force more powerful than anything the Knights have faced before leads them on a desperate mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broken Seal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark times call for dark measures! When the Preceptor Master summons you to his office in the middle of the night and swears you to secrecy before giving the mission briefing, you know this isn&amp;rsquo;t going to be a routine operation. A secret order of monks, long forgotten by the leaders of the Third Reformation Church, keeps eternal watch over a powerful force, a creature of absolute evil. After centuries of dormancy the evil has awakened, for a prophesized time has finally come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Material&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WM Appendix: Contains a quick system for creating non-combat missions, and additional Mission Tables to give the WM more choice in the sorts of combat adventures he runs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bestiary Update: Every stat you need to run the adventures is included to reduce book-flipping during play! Includes two new forms of Rephaim and two variants on the zombie stat block - sniper and grenadier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
