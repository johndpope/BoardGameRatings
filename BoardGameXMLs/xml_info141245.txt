			<description>This is a Larp, and a story game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a city which is like most others: in it are individual people who are trying to puzzle out their problems and who decide to stay up all night to wander the city in search of meaning, and there are also giant monsters who sneak unnoticed through the city, peering in at the lives of the humans and&lt;br/&gt;watching them consider their problems. And of course there's the municipal light truck, with its big searchlight which drives around attempting to locate these supposed giant monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
