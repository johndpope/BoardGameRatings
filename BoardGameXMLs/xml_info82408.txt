			<description>Cadillacs and Dinosaurs​ (キャディラックス 恐竜新世紀 Cadillacs Kyōryū Shin Seiki?) is a 1993 arcade game released by Capcom. It is a side-scrolling beat 'em up based on the comic book series Xenozoic Tales and a lot of fantasy. The game was produced as a tie-in to the Cadillacs and Dinosaurs animated series which was aired during the same year the game was released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Cadillacs and Dinosaurs the player has access to several special attacks. They are done in the same way for all the characters, but have varying degrees of effectiveness per character. By pressing attack and jump together, the player performs a 360 attack with momentary invulnerability that knocks down nearby enemies. By pressing forward, forward then attack, the player performs a dashing attack that can easily take down crowds of enemies. Mustapha's dashing attack is particularly effective, as it has long reach and priority. By pressing down, up then attack, the player will perform a rising attack that hits multiple times, but can leave the player vulnerable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cadillacs and Dinosaurs (arcade game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
