			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no shortage of individuals that strike out in search of gold and glory. Most aren&amp;rsquo;t particularly concerned with how they get it: the important thing is that they get it, and they survive long enough to enjoy basking in fame and fortune.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not you. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yeah you want both, but you want to earn them in style. It&amp;rsquo;s not enough to merely slay the dragon and get the gold, possibly even fame. There&amp;rsquo;s gotta be a chase, a cleverly sprung trap, a narrowly-avoided demise&amp;mdash;something for you and the other survivors to boast about when they limp back home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through sword and wit, loathsome monsters, dastardly villains, and even your companions will bear witness to your deeds. They&amp;rsquo;ll spread your name through fearful whispers and boisterous tales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains two separate pdf files. The first is a digest-sized, 23 page book laid out like the Dungeon World rulebook. It includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Swashbuckler, a complete class with 20 advanced moves: improve your fighting technique, goad enemies into fighting you, attract a sidekick, and more!&lt;br/&gt;    New equipment like parrying dagger and buckler, as well as some firearms if your campaign features them.&lt;br/&gt;    Two new magic items, including an artifact: do what it wants, and it'll become more powerful!&lt;br/&gt;    Seven moves that just didn't quite make the initial cut.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A kind of behind the scenes look at some of the fiction and other content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
