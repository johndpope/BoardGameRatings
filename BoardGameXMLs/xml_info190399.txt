							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Superior and Troglodyte</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I WILL FIND THE RIGHT FORMULA!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After secretly creating the monstrous, purple Grendel, Doctor Seymour Stevenson continued to experiment with his mutagen serum, hoping to turn his own frail body into the perfect physical specimen. Once discovered, Doctor Stevenson injected himself during his capture, becoming Superior (PL 10). He later escaped and turned his unwitting accomplice, Edwin Braxton, into the Troglodyte (PL 10), who serves as his muscle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Powered Legends. Because sometimes you a need a character everyone knows, even if they're meeting them for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
