			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Starfish Ambassador is a comic roleplaying game for 3 or more people. One player will take the role of the assistant to the Starfish Ambassador, which is a game-facilitating role similar to that of a game master in traditional RPGs. The remaining players will each take the roles of Senators from different states in the US, each of whom wants to land the factory and all of the jobs that come with it in their home state. In addition to the players, this game requires a stopwatch, a number of counters equal to the number of Senator players, one pen, and several pieces of paper or note cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two versions of the game are available.  The initial version was submitted to the Little Game Chef 2010 competition and has no attribution.  The second version includes credits.  In addition, the authorial comments vary.  The game itself is the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
