			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wedding with a missing bride, an uncaring father and a suitor who is out for blood make this a great murder mystery adventure. This module is filled with enough action for the most hack and slash players as well as enough common sense puzzling for those who prefer a wittier path. Of course, we can't say too much about it or we will give away the plot. Beautifully written and very well balanced, this module is sure to be one of your favorites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Love Forlorn is a short adventure designed for a party with a total of 25 levels (group of lvl 5 - 6). Love Forlorn is a stand-alone adventure in the city of Durblin. Durblin can be dropped into any existing world unchanged or reworked to fit any city in your world. This adventure will satisfy any group's craving for romance, mystery and horror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encounters are scaled for a party that uses magic weapons, has a priest and a rogue, and whose members' levels add to approximately 25.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
