							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Modern: 13 Occult Materials</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 7-page PDF -- by James Maliszewski -- can be used in a variety of ways, depending on the type of campaign the Game Master wants. The simplest and most straightforward use is to use the materials detailed inside in order to create ?treasure? for the heroes to find. Instead of finding merely an ancient dagger, for example, they might find a cold iron dagger?very useful in battling fey creatures. The materials presented here provide the GM with the means to create ?magical? items that don?t use overt FX, thereby allowing their abilities to remain truly hidden from the wider world. If the GM allows flashier magic, of course, these materials can be in conjunction with such FX to create even more potent items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In campaigns where the characters come to understand the true nature of occult forces, they might also learn to manipulate those forces themselves. In such cases, they might use these materials to craft their own magical items to aid them in the battles of the occult wars. Even in this case, these materials should be rare and difficult to obtain. After all, if they were common, science would know of their existence. For various reasons, all of the materials described in this PDF escape the notice of science and, were their existence to be made public, would undoubtedly undermine much of what humanity has come to accept as the truth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
