			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fun, interactive family board game that teaches you how to get smart about money. Players make real-life investment and career decisions, learn to balance their portfolios and plan for retirement, manage budgets and debt, and answer questions on fundamental principles of economics and finance. No prior experience needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start out with $100,000 cash, roll the dice, and proceed around the board. Spaces on the board correspond to different life events such as getting paid a salary, going on vacation, or picking from the three decks of cards that sit at the center of the board. The three decks of cards are: news flashes, knowledge cards, and wild cards. Newsflashes provide a news story, and players must buy and sell investments accordingly in order to win or lose money. Users may accept advice from other players for a shared win or loss in the investment. Knowledge cards are multiple choice cards that teach users key finance information that will be used in the game and life. Wild cards are life events that will cause the loser to win or lose money depending on whether or not they own the right assets. To win, a user must double their money and own a home, life and health insurance, and a retirement plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several levels of game play that allow for beginner users all the way through advanced users to play the game and be continually challenged. Additional card decks are available through our company website as they become available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
