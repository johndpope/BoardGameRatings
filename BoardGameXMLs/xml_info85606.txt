Pikachu and friends set out on an adventure to find them in the Pok&amp;eacute;Park, which encompasses various zones such as the meadow and lava zones. Pikachu makes friends with other Pok&amp;eacute;mon and can use their abilities to clear various attractions in the Pok&amp;eacute;Park. By clearing attractions, the player will obtain pieces of the Sky Prism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In battle, Pikachu is able to use Thunderbolt, Dash and eventually Iron Tail; these can be upgraded to become more powerful. Also, he can jump and do a flip to knock his enemy into a river, lake, etc..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can make friends through various mini-games as well, such as playing Chase, Hide &amp;amp; Seek, battling, playing Obstacle Hop, or by solving quiz questions correctly.
