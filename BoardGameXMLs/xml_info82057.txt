			<description>Atsuma, Makoto, and Toya are students at the Enchanter's University in Yokohama City. At the university, they study to become enchanters, while learning about topics such as the man-made golems that populate the world. Although powerful self-aware golems fought each other and laid waste to the land 1000 years ago during the Golem Wars, golems in the modern era serve mankind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One day, while the three are skipping class to attend a local festival, an apparent earthquake occurs. Additionally, the golems in the area appear to have gone berserk and are now attacking people. Rushing back to the university, the three find that things are in chaos, and that the mysterious &amp;quot;sealed ward&amp;quot; had been opened. While seeking to discover what has happened, the group meet up with the Queen of Ice, a Devil Golem sealed long ago. With her immense Ether capability and regeneration power, she overwhelms the three, taking Toya as ice falls on Makoto. Atsuma strikes back, guided by a mysterious voice, using his right arm that turns into something out of the ordinary that could harm a Devil Golem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atsuma wakes up in London City and is locked up in a cell while being refused to go and find out what happened to Yokohama.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enchanted_Arms,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enchanted_Arms,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the package:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experience one of the first true next-gen role-playing adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Become the savior in a war 1000 years in the making.
