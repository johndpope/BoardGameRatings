			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game heavily inspired by Boulder Dash. Tunnel through mud and rocks in order to rescue your people. The game manuial says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Your mission is to rescue almost a thousand survivors from a hibernation dome, damaged in the recent nuclear war. To complete the task you must guide three Droids through the 7 levels of the building and teleport the survivors to safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the Droids has a different function. Droid 1 can tunnel through tons of earth at high speed, Droid 2 is a very advanced droid whose function is to teleport the survivors to safety, and Droid 3 is a droid of immense strength, used for moving fallen boulders (although even he can only move one at a time).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
