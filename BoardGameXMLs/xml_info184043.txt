			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This the fullest implementation to date of this classic board game, Reversi.   Now although it follows the Othello rule set (start up placement alternated and a passed turn results when out of legal moves -- which came as quite a surprise) the games are so similar I think it's perfectly fine to use the older generic name for the game.   You can play locally, online, or against a good computer AI.   The camera can be moved around, there is asynchronous play available, a leaderboard   -- basically a lot of features to tailor the game to your liking.  Although the game had its fair share of bugs when it first came out, that seems to be in the past.   This game is made by the same BGGers (BlueLine Games) who brought out the wonderful versions of Khet and Hive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
