							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hoard the Spoils</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explorers have faced a lot of different kinds of enemies from bandits to master wizards who use fear, intimidation as well as magic, but a new threat rises to strip the people of their freedoms willingly. Charming the masses with a form of brotherhood these charlatans want to control the people and to demonize or kill anyone who won&amp;rsquo;t fall in line. This collective of wannabe emperors will be looking for ways to do this and it will be up to the players how they deal with this power struggle. Since the explorers could either stand in their way or join the ranks in the New Republic they will use their guilds as scapegoats by calling them hoarders and redistributing their wealth to the poor. Which will in turn make them look like heroes in the eyes of the people and the hoarders will become the villains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fight isn&amp;rsquo;t about good versus evil either it is about perception. You as a hoarder will be perceived as evil by those who believe that you are hiding your money from them in order to keep it for yourself, however in reality they have been duped in believing a lie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
