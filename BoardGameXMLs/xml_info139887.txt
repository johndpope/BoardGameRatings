			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When It's GOT to be Killed, Broken, or Both...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some problems can't be solved by legal means.  Sometimes things need to be broken, people need to be hurt, messages need to be sent.  In the old days, before Villain-Net, you could just hire some people to &amp;quot;take care of it.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, things aren't so good. The Swedish Bikini Assassin Team is out of play, and the day of the &amp;quot;Million Dollar Hit&amp;quot; has come and gone.  When you can find a dozen two-bit Super villains who will do the job for cheap (or for free!), who would pay that much?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a new alternative on the block.  If you need some violence done, and you need it done right, there's only one call to make.  You need Sexy Violence Incorporated!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See just how much damage three talented women can do when they set their minds to it; learn about their origins, their tremendous equipment, and the army of killer gynoids poised to back them up when things get rough!  Meet their &amp;quot;boss,&amp;quot; and find out why its a bad idea to chase him down and corner him.  Most of all, find out what it will take to hire these lovely ladies to make life difficult for anyone... even the Player Characters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a supplement for Hot Chicks: The RPG. You will need the core rulebook to play. It follows events in The Swedish Bikini Assassin Team, Strange Bedfellows (Hot Chicks), and Villain-Net; you may find those useful for reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
