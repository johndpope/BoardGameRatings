							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strike Fleet</name>
									
			<description>Strike Fleet is a 1987 computer game developed by Lucasfilm Games and published by Electronic Arts. It was released for the Amiga, Apple II, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and DOS [in 1988]. Strike Fleet is the unofficial sequel to the naval wargame PHM Pegasus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls either the American or British Fleets over the course of ten scenarios, of which the last four can be played as a single campaign. The player must fight against the navy and air forces of various other nations including Argentina, the Soviet Union, and Iran.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Situations posed by the scenarios include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the Captain of a U.S. frigate, your ship is stationed in the Persian Gulf as part of a routine patrol. Defend yourself and all neutral shipping in the Gulf, but do not fire unless attacked first. You may encounter friendly and enemy ships as well as aircraft. You must tread the thin line between provocation and overcaution, and decide what actions to take, if any.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Britain is battling it out with Argentina for control of the Falklands. Argentina has an attack squadron fueled and ready for launch from their carrier - weather conditions are the only thing that hampers their progress. Your mission is to engage and take out Argentine task group 79.4 - composed of three frigates - which is supporting the main attack force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to World War III. Bottle up the Soviet fleet in the Norwegian Sea before they escape through the Greenland-Iceland-U.K. gap. You&amp;rsquo;ll meet your objective if you sink enough of their ships and subs to seriously cripple their forces. Two Orion search planes, operating out of Iceland, will provide sub hunting support to your fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Strike Fleet&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only 5 Ships Left... And a Dozen Missiles Headed Your Way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've lost 3 frigates, a destroyer and a pair of Seahawks. $2 billion in state-of-the-art hardware and hundreds of lives lost. The enemy has you in its sights and a dozen Kingfish missiles are headed toward your fleet. Your Ticonderoga class flagship is crippled. And the Phalanx system on your remaining destroyer is inoperative. Only quick thinking and decisive action can make the difference between decoration and court-martial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
