			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LISTEN UP!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pay attention, folks, or you might miss something important - like the latest issue of the Lunar Voice the most popular news magazine on Luna or any of the other worlds of Mutant Chronicles.  In this, our long-awaited all-Cybertronic issue, you'll learn everything you ever wanted to know about the newest Megacorp, but were afraid to ask for fear the Cardinal might over hear you.  Now you can get all the stright dope right from the battered typewriters of the slickest investigative reporters around - and have no worries about a trip to an Inquisition cell.  We promise!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FIND OUT ALL ABOUT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE FOUNDING DAY: How Cybertronic was born in blood and money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CYBERTRONIC'S THREE PILLARS: A high-tech corp with more letters than the alphabet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUBREALITY: Everyone talks about it.  What is it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EXCELLENCY THROUGH PERFECTION: Cybertronic goods hot and here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CHROMED DIPLOMACY: What do the other corps think about the new kid?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE CYBERTRONIC WAY:  How does Cybertronic succeed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE FACE OF A FACELESS ENTITY: Who are the Cybers?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CYBERIZING: How to join Cybertronic, or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus, for those of you who care about such things, there's a 30 page pull-out section that details all about how to create and play a Cybertronic character for use with our wildly popular role-playing game, plus &amp;quot;The Foe of my Foe&amp;quot;, a quick and exciting complete adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
