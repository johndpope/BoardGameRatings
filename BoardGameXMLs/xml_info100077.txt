			<description>From the manual:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;EVIL IN THE NORTH!&lt;br/&gt;For years it was prophesied that a hero would be born in the cold, dark North, a hero who would restore peace and joy to the Earth. This hero, known as Brian, has finally been born. But the evil god Loki, learning of the child's birth, captured his family one day while he was away. Loki is using Brian's family as bait to draw the young hero to his wicked realm where Loki's forces can crush Brian and cause eternal chaos. Now Brian must accept his quest. He must travel through dangerous lands and confront Loki himself.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
