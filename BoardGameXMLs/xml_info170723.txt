			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take your battles to the sea, the skies, and beyond!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This rules supplement delves takes the incredible expansion of Pathfinder mass combat rules in Ultimate Battle (Pathfinder) and takes it into new realms of warfare. Fantasy mass combat rules have typically focused on land warfare, but Ultimate Warfare continues to expand the rules developed in its predecessor and in Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Campaign to create a seamlessly integrated mass combat system that connects the battlefield on land to the action in the skies above, the seas beyond, and the deeps below. It also provides detailed rules for siege warfare, from simple blockade and bombardment to incendiaries, plague, infiltration, and dramatic escalades. Ultimate Warfare also includes an all-new system of modular unit building and operations, allowing development of versatile combined arms units or simplified squadron-level aerial or naval battles.  Ultimate War contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     12 new command boons like Falling Dusk, Surgical Strike, and War Chant&lt;br/&gt;     10 aerial vehicles from mundane balloons and gliders to floating citadels and war rockets&lt;br/&gt;     13 new tactics for aerial units from strafing and dive bombing to aerial boarding operations and diving out of the sun, as well as 4 special tactics for ground units to use against fliers&lt;br/&gt;     23 naval vehicles from war canoes and longships to ironclads and submersibles&lt;br/&gt;     13 naval tactics from ramming and beaching to shearing the oars or cutting the rigging&lt;br/&gt;     31 siege weapons from catapults and ballistae to cannons and mines, plus rules for artillerists, 8 different special siege tactics, and 7 magical siege weapons from the blizzard ballista to the zombie apocalypse siege shot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are looking to expand your mass combat options that work seamlessly with the kingdom rulership rules in Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Campaign and in Ultimate Rulership (Pathfinder), look no further than Ultimate War and its companion volume,  Ultimate Battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick up Ultimate War today to bring amazing depth and dimension to mass combat in your campaign and Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
