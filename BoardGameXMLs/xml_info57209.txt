							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cel-Maris Station (Fudge)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great food, aliens, and interstellar intrigue!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cel-Maris Station provides a science-fiction mini-setting usable for the entire spectrum of roleplaying, from &amp;quot;realisitic&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;space opera.&amp;quot; Originally built to carry a large number of colonists to the fledgling Mars colony, the cycler station has been converted to a vacation cruise for the rich, absurdly wealthy, and those with Real Money. Welcome aboard as one of the vacationers, their retainers, a crew member working off the cost of transit to a new home, or perhaps an alien gourmet chef.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A quick introduction to transit stations and notes on how to run a game using this mini-setting in both &amp;quot;hard&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;soft&amp;quot; science fiction campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;     A history of the station and a level-by-level breakdown of the inhabited sections of the station.&lt;br/&gt;     A sample price list.&lt;br/&gt;     Four Alien Species for use in any science fiction campaign&lt;br/&gt;     A GM's &amp;quot;Secret Stuff&amp;quot; section with a few curveballs.&lt;br/&gt;     Biographies and in-depth descriptions of seven important station personnel&lt;br/&gt;     A mini-module, A Playful Death, with 5 complete pre-generated characters. Players have the fun(?) job of bodyguarding one of the five richest humans in the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;     Four pages of 100% vector-based, highly scalable station maps.&lt;br/&gt;     Follows Five Point Fudge&amp;trade; as detailed in Fudge&amp;trade; 10th Anniversary Edition. The mini-module A Playful Death can be run using Fudge&amp;trade; in a Nutshell if no additional character generation is needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
