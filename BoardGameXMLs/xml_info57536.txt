			<description>Hachi-Hachi (means 88) is the elegant culture of Japanese Cardgames. Not even from its Hanafuda deck, but also from materials (like cake tickets, Dharma tiles, war-fan, monthly track plate and small baskets), you will discover its uniqueness and grace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game system is very similar to fishing games like Casino, or Scopa, but only Japanese Hanafuda (and Korean Hwatu) includes turning a card from draw pile at your turn. And sometimes, splendid combination of taken cards becomes big score. These rules make the game more thrilling and brilliant. Hand combos are a bit complex but the basic is easy. Soon, you can learn them from charts. Because these hand combos have handicap points, you can select to play even with such a weak hands. In this case, turning a card becomes more thrilling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After seen your hand, if you decided no chance to win, you can drop from the round like Poker. But you must pay dropping fee to the pot (winner of the round get the pot). This system may teach players self control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is convenient game for playing with 3 to 7 players. Active players are always 3 (or 2). Thus voluntary or not, other players should drop (If you have to drop involuntary, you can get compensation). Its playing style is loose paced, you shall feel the time of gentle (but hot hearted).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MOVIE : &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://youtu.be/PW-_zUlbtzs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/PW-_zUlbtzs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
