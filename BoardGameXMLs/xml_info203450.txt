							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jacksons Field</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 30 x 24 inch, Battlemap of a Field with Buildings , it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your imaginary friend did it? Nonsense!  Who killed my boy?! &amp;ldquo;&amp;mdash;sobbing Ma Jackson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jackson&amp;rsquo;s Field is a single level exterior map of a north dirt road, adjacent, parallel creek to the south, a vehicle bridge across to the field, a walking bridge across to the other side of the east fence, and an enclosed field with interior maps of a shed, two chicken coops, and a stable in the back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jackson&amp;rsquo;s Field is intended for use in western and modern games. It can be very useful as a starting or stopping point for a cattle drive kind of game. The map can also be used in fantasy games with some modification (for example, the mailbox holds a portal that gets mail from another dimension and the light pole becomes a magical lantern to explain the couple of modern conveniences that would be out of place).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field of Screams: A ghost has haunted Jackson&amp;rsquo;s Field for nearly a century. The ghost can only be seen by young boys and girls. They call him their imaginary friend. The ghost dreamed of being a baseball star and wants the kids to fulfill his dream of changing Jackson&amp;rsquo;s Field to an actual baseball field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, the kids invariably play baseball for their imaginary friend, but they don&amp;rsquo;t convert the field into a baseball field. Instead they pretend that the trough is home plate, using the circular dirt patch as a mound, the shed as first base, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the kids get old enough, they forget about the imaginary friend and his dream. Now as the decades have mounted and the ghost has continued to persist in limbo, he grows desperate. One of the Jackson boys has been found murdered, apparently by bludgeoning by the ghost for failing to make the field into a baseball field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters are sent to investigate the shocking murder. All the kids claim their former imaginary friend killed the boy. The group can&amp;rsquo;t see or hear the ghost, only kids and rare adults with big imagination seem to be able to communicate with the ghost. Can the PCs get the story out the kids and help the ghost cross over one way or another before the mad ghost murders another child in anger?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
