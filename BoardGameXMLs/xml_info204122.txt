			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many years ago, in ages past when the gods of humanity were starting to grow in power, there rose among the population of Karaken, a cult dedicated to the shunned goddess of death, Pestula.  The leaders of this movement were primarily cleric/magic-users whose ultimate goal was to place a chosen one of their goddess upon the throne of the land.  They succeeded in infiltrating the royal household and in one dark, evil evening, killed the entire royal family and made of their deaths an offering to the goddess.  Pestula responded by taking unto herself one of her male followers and begetting of him a cambion of great power who was called by men Zagaroth, the despoiler. Through the power of Pestula, Zagaroth was born full into his own power and strength and was placed upon the throne of Karaken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For characters level 6th - 10th&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
