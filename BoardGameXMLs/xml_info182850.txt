							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sorceress of Zoom: Down to Earth</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Earth Plane Vexes Me! I Will Stand For It No Longer!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sorceress of Zoom is the most powerful spellcaster on her homeworld. There are few sights that terrify populations more than her amazing cloud city appearing in the air above their homes -- for the sorceress is never denied what she wants, and others always pay the price. She is the deadliest of femme fatales, and she is turning her attention to the treasures of Earth!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sorceress of Zoom was a quirky fantasy series that appeared in the pages of Weird Comics during 1940 and 1941. Featuring the weirdest of weird fantasy, each installment saw her bringing to bear powerful magic to ward off all comers in pursuit of selfish and often horrific goals. It's a great example of the &amp;quot;anything goes&amp;quot; nature of the early Golden Age of Comics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to five classic tales of the Sorceress, The Sorceress of Zoom: Down to Earth contains feats, a talent tree, and other rules to bring Sorceress-style reality-style action to your OGL d20 System games; as well as game stats for the artifacts that grant their possessor mastery of Zoom, the Sorceress's flying city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
