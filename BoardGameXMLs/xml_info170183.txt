			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shane slid his sensitive fingers over the front of the dragon statue&amp;rsquo;s base. The young burglar focused on locating a secret compartment or hidden catch on the statue while Kor stood guard near the western entrance. Faedorn stood near the center of the chamber, examining ancient runes engraved on one of the massive stone pillars that rose from the dusty, flagstone floor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then a strange slurping sound came to Faedorn&amp;rsquo;s sensitive ears, drawing the elf&amp;rsquo;s attention toward the eastern archway. The sound continued, but Faedorn could see nothing beyond the dark archway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The elf spoke a few soft words and touched the tip of the oak staff he carried. A soft glow appeared on the tip of the weapon. The radiance spread, slowly growing and pushing the darkness back, except for a single patch of black near the archway, a slimy, seeping horror that slowly slid into the chamber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Universal Underworlds, the fifth release in the Across the Realms Encyclopedia of Adventure series. Universal Underworlds brings together two of our favorite product lines, Universal Adventures and Ogres and Underworlds.
