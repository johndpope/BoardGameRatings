							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Experimental Technical Readout: Pirates</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Engineers' Playground&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thieves, rogues, outlaws, murderers, scum &amp;ndash; these are the pirates of the Inner Sphere. For mankind's worst element, the chaos of the Jihad is simply another opportunity to profit through force. The tools of the militaries they face are tough, but it doesn't take an unlimited budget and the resources of a stellar empire to get creative-and stolen prototype weapons can kill just as well as anything off the shelf. Armed with the best tech they can lay their hands on, the cleverest pirates field experimental-grade BattleMechs, vehicles, and fighters that keep their enemies guessing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental Tech Readout: Pirates samples the custom designs that have appeared in the BattleTech universe during the Jihad. Each design featured in this book incorporates some of the latest technologies developed by the realms of the Inner Sphere in their war against the Word of Blake, as first described in Tactical Operations &amp;ndash; deployed now by the malcontents daring enough to steal them. Statistics and Record Sheets are included for 13 new experimental BattleMechs, vehicles, and aerospace units, ready for play in advanced BattleTech games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
