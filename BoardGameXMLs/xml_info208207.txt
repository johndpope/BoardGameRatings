			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure can be played at any point in the middle of a campaign, or used as a way to introduce a new group of characters to each other under adverse circumstances. It should provide sufficient challenges for a group in a basic or first advanced career, and offer some interesting situational roleplaying along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario begins during the harvest season at a coaching inn situated in the fertile farmlands fed by the Aver River. You can easily place it in any isolated farming village along any river in the Empire and even adjust the time of year as necessary to suit your campaign. The original setting was north of the Aver, between the river and the Stirh&amp;uuml;gel, but should be adaptable anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
