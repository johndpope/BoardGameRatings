			<description>Paper-and-pencil game where from 2 to 4 players must score the most possible points by filling a row or column of an 8x8 board with their own symbol over several rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a round players throw a dice in their turn and then tick a space on the board with their symbol (dot, circle, square or cross); the points in the dice mark the distance this space must have to either the player's starting row (at one of the sides of the board) or one of the spaces occupied by the player, and the way to that space must be free (if there are occupied spaces in between they must include the player's own symbol).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a line is filled with one symbol each player gets a point per own symbol included in the line and the player to end the round gets one extra point. A game includes a number of rounds to be agreed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
