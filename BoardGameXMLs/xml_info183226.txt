							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paper Doll Game</name>
									
			<description>A poem on the box describes the game: &amp;quot;A Thoughtful Girl must dress with care. / What goes with what?  What shall you wear? / The spinner says to pick some shoes. / But only YOU know which you'll choose. / And with your clothing you'll select / the hobby that you most respect. / Pursue your vision with a passion-- / There's more to life than only fashion! / The first one dressed and on her way / has won the game. / Do you want to play?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a paper doll and take turns spinning the spinner.  The spinner will tell them which piece of clothing or accessory to add to their doll.  One space on the spinner requires the spinner to lose a piece.  The first player to completely dress and equip his or her doll wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is notable for its diverse paper doll characters, multi-ethnic outfits and selection of hobbies that is less stereotypically girly, such as astronomy, guitar and science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
