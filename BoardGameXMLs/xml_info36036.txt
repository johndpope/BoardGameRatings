							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gunslingers</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;Board, dice, &amp;amp; card game for 2+ players. Wild West Theme. Battle between gunslingers. Abstract skirmish level combat. Each figure represents a single man (unit). Victory: You win if you kill all enemy gunslingers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a chessboard or any other 8x8 grid. Chits are used to indicate terrain features. Miniatures or counters are used to represent the gunslingers. There are seven types of gunslingers represented in the game: Cowboy, Outlaw, Indian, Lawman, Soldier, Pistol, and Rifle. Each type of gunslinger is rated for seven attributes, including Guts, Smarts, Cool, Eyes, and Hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Action Deck is a custom deck of cards central to the play of the game. The players draw a hand of cards for each gunslinger from this common deck. Card play determines when units may move, attack, and defend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optional rules are provided for horses, shotguns, and carrying multiple guns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
