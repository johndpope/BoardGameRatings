			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;The Next Round is a game poem in which you try to persuade the others that you are allowed to buy the next round for your drunk friends in a loud pub before it is to late because the pub is closing soon. But nobody can let anyone buy the drinks instead of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues (without coming to blows) until a predetermined time has passed (12 to 15 minutes) when last orders are called. The group then have 30 seconds to unanimously decide who buys the drinks, or the opportunity is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
