			<description>From the developer's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a near-future world where Russia and the United States vie for ownership of the world&amp;rsquo;s fast-depleting energy resources, the US has constructed a space station in order to harness energy from the sun. Russian forces capture this space station and divert its harvested solar energy into a blast wave that destroys San Francisco, aiming to force the US into a total and unconditional surrender. In response, the US tasks its armed forces with recapturing the space station before the Russians can annihilate their next target - New York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Directed by Shinji Mikami, the creator of the Resident Evil series, VANQUISH is a sci-fi shooter that sees players take the role of Sam, a government agent kitted out with a futuristic battle suit. A versatile fighter with a huge arsenal of weaponry at his disposal, Sam also has an array of martial arts skills that he can use to take down his robot enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast, fluid and frenetic - this is gaming at its most explosive and exciting, as you storm into battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experience a game character like no other - Sam is the ultimate weapon, donning a futuristic battle suit of destructive firepower and superhuman speed and agility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight your way through the enormous, open environments of the space station. The most advanced, futuristic city in the skies becomes home to the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
