							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fineous Frost</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He spent decades on ice, and he has no plans to go back&amp;hellip; Fineous Frost!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level 10 Rogue, Fineous Frost is a man with a lifetime of criminal experience. Fineous Frost is an iconic character in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fineous Frost's file is designated &amp;quot;Gold&amp;quot; to denote that his powers are the result of external manipulation of some kind. Exactly what kind of chemical cocktail is responsible for his transformation remains a closely guarded secret, but his ability to create and manipulate areas of intense cold are a chilling experience for anyone who would stand in his way. To the world at large, Frost is a reformed ex-convict, setting up a business in the heroes&amp;rsquo;s home town. In secret, Frost is a more careful criminal, operating from behind the scenes, and he plays well against heroic detectives who are diligent enough to untangle his criminal web to discover the spider at the center. He would also certainly hold a grudge against heroes who carry the legacies of other heroes he faced in his earlier career, before he spent decades years in prison. Or, if one of your heroes is an immortal himself, Frost may be a &amp;ldquo;blast from the past&amp;rdquo; to represent the never-ending fight against crime!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
