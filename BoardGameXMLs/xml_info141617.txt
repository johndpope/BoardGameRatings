			<description>The game is played with a deck of 8-Bit Playing cards, the traditional deck. All 56 cards including the gaff cards and jokers are used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with each player receiving a king card, they are shuffled and dealt out randomly. Once the king cards are dealt each player then receives 5 cards.  The kings are held with the hand so the other players don't know which king the other players have. The player at the dealers left begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player lays a card down to start a trick , all of the players play a card from that trick if they have it. If they don't they must draw a card then play any card.  They player with the highest card with the same suite that was started wins the trick, unless a gaff or joker is played. The player that plays a gaff or Joker gets to take the trick. If multiple gaffs or jokers are played the players must enter into a best of 3 roll-off with 8-bit dice. If there are more than 2 jokers or gaff cards played on one hand. The players roll one die each, the player with the highest roll gets a bye in the first round as the other players roll against each other. The highest total best of 3 wins the roll off. If any player in a roll off rolls double ?s or double aces (the engraved picture on the 1 spot) they win the roll off immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who won the last trick begins the next trick, the game ends when someone runs out of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    3 points for every trick won that matches the same suite as your king. &lt;br/&gt;    2 points for every trick won that includes a gaff or joker.&lt;br/&gt;    1 point for every trick won that does not match the suite of your king.&lt;br/&gt;    -1 point for every card left in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in sets, and points are recorded after each set. The first person to earn 25 Points is The Pixeled King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
