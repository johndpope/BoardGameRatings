							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sock Puppet Charades</name>
									
			<description>In this silly twist on Charades, players take turns placing one or two sock puppets on their hands and creatively act out as many of the three items on their card that they can get through before the sand timer runs out. The puppets come with holes on the side and the thumb and pinky are used as arms. The game also comes with small props to help act out the words on the cards. All of the other players try to guess what is being acted out.  Both the actor and the correct guesser score points when items are guessed. The player with the most points after the designated number of rounds is the Puppet Master!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
