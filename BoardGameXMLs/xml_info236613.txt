			<description>A One-Round Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You all awake somewhat worn, but grateful to be alive. The past 24 hours have been rather unusual. Yesterday started out quite simple. You responded to a notice about an open competition to fill the vacated position of mages guild leader. There were approximately a hundred other candidates, each of them rumored to be at the top of his/her chosen field. The competition was fierce and at the end of the day the field was narrowed down to 11 finalists, the six of you and five other wizards. The contest was suspended last night and set to resume at 10:00 am this morning, so that each of you could rest up for the events ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This should not be confused with COR8-03: Aspirations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
