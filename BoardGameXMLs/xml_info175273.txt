							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Missing Mythic Magic Volume XV</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uncover Forgotten Arcane Lore!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone knows that knowledge is power, and that having options is better than not having them. It should come as no surprise, then, that wizards, witches, and other powerful spellcasters are always on the lookout for new and exciting spells to add to their repertoires. While many spells from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook received a facelift and an upgrade in Mythic Adventures, the sourcebook that introduced mythic power to the game of Pathfinder, dozens of spells were left behind. Missing Mythic Magic Volume XV, and its predecessors, aim to give each and every spell from the core rules a full-fledged mythic upgrade, all the way from A to Z, with a special focus on making mythic spells that feel as over-the-top and larger-than-life as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This installment includes 22 mythic spells, from permanency to produce flame. A mythic phantom trap can create the effects of a real trap, allowing any object to be easily trapped by magic. A mythic planar ally can get the summoned creature&amp;rsquo;s allegiance for free, whereas a mythic great planar ally allows you to call outsiders for a greater period of time. Meanwhile, a mythic planar binding can potentially hold bound outsiders indefinitely, and a mythic plant shape grants plant traits that are not granted by the normal version of the spell. This tome contains all that, and much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
