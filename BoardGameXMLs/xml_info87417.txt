			<description>Pok&amp;eacute;mon Trading Card Game is a video game simulation of the original tabletop collectible card game with role-playing elements similar to earlier titles in the Pok&amp;eacute;mon series. Players control a young boy named Mark (Japanese: パーク Parke), and must travel around the game world interacting with non-player characters and challenging them to card battles using 60-card decks. During gameplay, the player must defeat eight Club Masters, each with a different deck representing one of the game's elemental card types, allowing them to face four Grand Masters and earn the right to inherit four powerful Legendary Cards. A total of 226 cards exist within the game, which include cards from the first three sets of the real-life game, as well as exclusive cards not available outside of the game. The player is given to opportunity to choose one of three starter decks at the start of their journey, each containing Pok&amp;eacute;mon cards revolving around the three possible starting creatures from Pok&amp;eacute;mon Red and Blue. As players defeat opponents, they are rewarded with booster packs containing a random assortment of additional cards they may use in their deck, with up to four separate decks able to be saved at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to two players may interact with each other using the Game Boy Color's infrared linking capability to battle or trade cards As players trade with one another, they are given access to a special feature called &amp;quot;Card Pop!&amp;quot;, which allows them to obtain cards that would otherwise be inaccessible in the main game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
