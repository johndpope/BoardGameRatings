			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Dicemaster Adventure for 3rd level characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When people start going missing from the region of Raneralk, the Free Nation of Erilgor sends heroes to investigate. Arriving in the representative village of Denop, there are few clues, but trouble is always brewing with the neighboring Roc-Knocker Goblins, and the villagers insist they know something about it. Desperate to save the missing villagers our heroes will need to brave the perils of the massive Toma's Dormer, a dangerous hike few attempt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many rumors surround the dormer, but are any of them true? Tales of lost cities, treasure troves of gold, and of evil cults practicing ancient magic deep within it's caverns run wild amongst the smallfolk of Raneralk. The PC's will learn what lies within, as the investigation brings them into greater conflict with the cliff dwelling goblins and their evil masters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can the PC's save the villagers in time? Why are people disappearing without so much as a ransom note? What will become of the region should the PC's fail?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
