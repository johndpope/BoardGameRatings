							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scoreboard Cricket</name>
									
			<description>Similar to card cricket where two cards are drawn - one from each pack and the score and play is determined by the corresponding square on the board. Scores are then entered in the score pad. When an uneven score is shown the second batsmen faces the bowler, if even runs are scored the same batter picks up the next card. When a batter goes out the new batter faces the bowler ... there are a few other rules but not too complicated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
