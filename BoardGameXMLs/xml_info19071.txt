							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">World War III: 1988</name>
									
			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;With a brief but deadly skirmish between NATO and Warsaw Pact forces on the border of Germany quickly expanding, Soviet generals see their chance to bring war to NATO forces and destroy the alliance once and for all and bring all of Europe under the Soviet flag. With approximately 20,000 Soviet-made tanks in Europe and over 1 million men under arms moving into the Fulda gap and other choke points along West Germany, NATO may be in for the fight of its very existence as each nation involved as both hunter and prey. Based on the first three novels of the series, WW III by Ian Slater.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this, you'll be provided with the game's mapsheets, rules, charts, etc., while you will utilize the components from Axis &amp;amp; Allies or related games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
