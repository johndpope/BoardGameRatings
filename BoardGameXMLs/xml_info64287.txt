							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sultans and Sentences</name>
									
			<description>The learners are students of grammar in the third grade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed to be played during or after class, but after students have been introduced to the subjects used in the game. It will be used to reinforce parts of speech, pronouns, punctuation marks, simple sentence structure, and past and future verb tenses and use children's natural desire to play games to instruct in elementary grammar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the Sultans and Sentences game is to be the first player to reach the Magic Carpet Ride in the clouds. Players advance by drawing cards, answering the question correctly and moving the appropriate number of spaces. Players encounter detours or rewards created by Special Cards or Squares on their Arabian adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
