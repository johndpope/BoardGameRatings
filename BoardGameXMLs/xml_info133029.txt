							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Men of Romance</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a narrative roleplaying game, created in just 24 hours as part of a design contest on RPGGEEK. From initial content to final proofread, this has taken from midnight to midnight on Wednesday the 17th of October 2012. Men of Romance can be used to play the part of typical romance novel heroes in one of three different narrative play styles. This game draws on years of reading and enjoying romance novels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've called this a narrative game because the aim of Men of Romance is to roleplay and create an enjoyable narrative in a short-term game, rather than create characters who will continue through a number of adventures. All the styles of play in Men of Romance lend themselves to one-shot games or at most two or three game sessions. Men of Romance is not intended to provide sustained campaign play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
