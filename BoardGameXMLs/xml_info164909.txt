			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyber-Cthulhu combines the best parts of the two most popular Starbright games, Present Day Cthulhu and Cyber-Fate.  &lt;br/&gt; Cyberpunk and the Cthulhu Mythos, two dark settings where characters often come to a bad end, are blended to produce something gritty and neon mixed with cosmic awe and terror. This book includes the Cyber-Cthulhu setting and a compact version of the Fate Core rules, so you have everything you need to confront these alien horrors in one place. &lt;br/&gt; The game is set on Earth in the future, when city sprawl covers huge areas of the planet. Humanity has made the jump off planet, but only as far as Mars. It's a dangerous world, full of corporate goons, street samurai, androids, towering cities, toxic weather, and now, gibbering monsters. &lt;br/&gt; This 177-page book provides Mythos locations, monsters, NPCs, the Dreamlands, several cults, character creation rules, a timeline showing how the world got so messed up, and a secret timeline of Mythos events, a list of megacorporations, gear, cybernetics, and vehicles.  &lt;br/&gt; This is a distinctive background, with a high tech, cyberpunk feel, which integrates beautifully with pitiless monsters haunting the underdark beneath the sprawl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power up your implants, and explore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
