			<description>Breadcrumbs is an abstract strategy game for two to five players with a modular board and partial shared-point mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Breadcrumbs, players take turns moving to claim sections of the board, which translate into points. If a player claims a tile that matches their color, they claim double points. But, players must be careful of their movements, as revisiting a tile that you've already moved to results in you losing your claim! And beware, other players can stake a claim into your tiles to reduce your points and claim some of their own!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
