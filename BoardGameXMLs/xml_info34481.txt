			<description>An American Indian game attributed to the Zuni tribe of the Southwestern U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game for two or four players played on a board made up of 168 squares each intersected by diagonal lines. The board is composed of a 12x12 grid with a line of six starting/home squares parallel to and centered along each edge of the board. The players place their six pieces in these squares at the start of the game. In addition, each player has a seventh piece, which is slightly larger, known as the Priest of the Bow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to cross the board and occupy the opposing home spaces, capturing as many men as possible on the way. Moves are made one square at a time along diagonal lines, with the pieces being placed at intersecting points. The pieces may not be moved backward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When two pieces surround an opposing piece, it is captured and removed from the board. The first captured piece is replaced by the capturing player's Priest of the Bow, which has the ability to move either on the diagonal lines as normal, or at right angles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
