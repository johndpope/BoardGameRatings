			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clyde&amp;rsquo;s Adventure is a puzzle-platform title for DOS. Clyde is an adventurer searching for treasure in 16 enormous castles. The goal is to collect all of the gems in the castle, find the artefact at the castle&amp;rsquo;s centre, and escape without running out of energy. Clyde&amp;rsquo;s energy depletes each time he takes a step, jumps, or falls too far.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To aid in his exploration, Clyde has a wand that he can use to flip switches or light conveniently located bombs. The switches can do anything from open up hidden passages to dropping the floor out beneath the player, leading to an early demise. The bombs will explode and destroy nearby blocks, but if Clyde is too close he will be destroyed as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The full game contains 32 castles, split into 2 episodes. Episode 1: Lost Treasure of Tahookaboo, was shareware that is now available as freeware, while Episode 2: The Vanished King, required registration to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
