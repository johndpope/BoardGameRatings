			<description>Time to fish, but you're rewarded only when you catch the right pair of fish so pay attention to who's swimming where - and stay away from the boot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up Fish-a-Ree, players must first open the game board, then set it on top of the game cannister. Then insert the ten fish tiles and two boot tiles into the dozen slots on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player reveals one of the 24 number cards, then pulls out two tiles &amp;ndash; one at a time &amp;ndash; by pulling on the ring at the top of the tile. The player then lays out the tiles against the ruler included in the game. If the sum of the lengths of these fish equal the number card, then the player keeps the card. If not &amp;ndash; or if a player draws a boot &amp;ndash; then he scores nothing. In either case, the player must return the tiles to the locations where they were originally located.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect five cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
