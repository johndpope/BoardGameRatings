							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Black Death</name>
									
			<description>An extended adventure for Ars Magica, second edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;Death comes to us in many horrible forms. We may fall to mischievous Demons. We may be struck down by the unseen murdered. Or, we may be taken by the most virulent elemental flame. But all these deaths know no kinship to that most feared by all- the Plague. The Black Death is the most heinous of ends for it leaves one utterly alone. No one can bear the presence of one stricken, and all run in fear. Even the Lord's most faithful servants dare not approach, ensuring that the plague bearer passes without redemption or final forgiveness. Pity he who suffers the Unholy Death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Death is an Ars Magica adventure that pits the characters against a most fearsome foe, the Plague. The town of Montrouge has fallen victim to contagion, and the neighboring Covenant, As Vis Per Veritas, has fallen with it. If the characters hope to salvage Ad Vis Per Veritas, reunite its scattered magi and preserve its rich source of vis, the characters much risk the Plague itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though the may resist the Black Death and rebuild Montrouge, the characters soon learn that a more diabolical power is at work, that the plague may have had origins within the Order of Hermes itself...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
