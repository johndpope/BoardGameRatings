			<description>The Mall is a money spending game. Every player starts with hefty sum which he needs to get rid off by any means possible.  Buying clothes, gadgets, or simply going to the movies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moving is determined by dice rolling and visiting the stores, by a special roulette.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Problem is, that unlike real life, it turns out to be quite a chore, and not at all easy...&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes the goods are not expensive enough, or unfortunately just on sale. Other times a simple hot dog would do the trick for your tummy, but sadly, not for your wallet.&lt;br/&gt;But no matter what, you always should take care, not to win the lottery....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won when a player has managed to spend all his money, or has bought enough variety of goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
