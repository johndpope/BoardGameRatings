							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Euro Port Game</name>
									
			<description>Dutch game about the biggest port in the world, Rotterdam. The game was released to promote this port. With 5 different ships a player goes through every stage that a ship arriving in the Rotterdam harbor would go through. Chance cards influence the things that could happen when a ship goes from Rotterdam to another port. The value of the cargo can increase or decrease, the stock market can change, a ship could even sink or could be forced to change it's route. The moment that a player has all 5 of his ships docked the game ends. The player with the most money in the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
