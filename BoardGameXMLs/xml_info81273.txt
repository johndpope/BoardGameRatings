			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this RPG you play yourself. You'll give yourself some attributes and skills that match the way you really are. The action starts the minute you get out of bed tomorrow morning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you plan to get together to play, the most imaginative person among you and your friends should be the Storyteller (ST). This person will lead the rest of the players through their adventure in the land of Tomorrow. There you run into people you already know (or think you know) and you'll visit the same places you do in real life. The mysteries, action and adventure of Tomorrow, however, are always anything but ordinary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to play this game you'll need a ten-sided die (called a d10) and a few sheets of paper. Oh yeah, and you'll need a lot of imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
