			<description>100 Points Prediction is a simple, casual card game in the 100 Points line of games that uses 100 Points cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 100 Points Prediction each player rolls a 6-sided die and draws a number of cards equal to their roll. Each player then guesses as to what the total number of points are of all the cards in all the players' hands. One by one players reveal their cards and everyone finds out the the total number of points. The player who guessed the closest without going over wins. The losing players put their cards in their discard pile. The last player with cards in their deck wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played with 2 or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player needs their own set of 100 Points cards and a 6-sided die to play the game. &lt;br/&gt;(Publisher description)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
