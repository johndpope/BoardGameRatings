			<description>One Last Job is a strategy card game for 2 players that plays out in about 30 minutes. One player takes the role of the Crew, assembling a team of operatives with specialized equipment and using daring tactics to pull off a heist. Meanwhile, the other player acts as The Powers That Be, secretly laying traps and deploying countermeasures while working to grow their influence over the city. Can the Crew get in and get out before The Powers complete their nafarious scheme?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One Last Job features hidden information, bluffing, and calculated risks as both players outwit and adapt to each other. In this seedy world of corruption and evil agendas, nothing is certain. An apparently easy heist can quickly go south due ot unforeseen complications, while a near impoosible one can be miraculously pulled off. Everything action and counteraction is a dangerous gamble for both sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weather you want to play the classic heist of an elite professional team taking on the mafia to settle a score, or perhaps something more fantastical, One Last Job has you covered. Ever wonder how a group of 90's hackers would fare at preventing a world crisis by an evil mastermind? Or if you could get wacky street gangs to put aside their in-fighting to steal the knowledge of a secret society? One Last Job features 6 factions (3 for each side), each with their own unique strategies and flavor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
