							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Enhanced Racial Guide: Bhriota</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bhriota adventurers normally pursue one of two simple goals: survival or power. Those who seek merely to escape their tribe and horrific lives travel far and wide seeking a place of relative safety, and perhaps someone they might call a friend and ally. Others seek to destroy those who will rule over them, either to free their people from the vindari, to take the vindari&amp;rsquo;s place as the dominant force, or for simple vengeance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enhanced Racial Guide: Bhriota offer players of Shadows over Vathak all new background information of the bhriota, as well as new rules and mechanics to increase your gaming options. Included in this 42 page guide are expanded information on the history and culture of the bhriota, new alternate racial traits, racial archetypes, prestige class, feats, equipment, campaign traits, equipment (including a legendary weapon), rules of bhriota rune magic, and descriptions of the various tribe types and how to play characters from those backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
