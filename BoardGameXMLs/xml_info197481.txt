			<description>It's the future! Tanks can fly, and they're super-fast! Bang-bang-bang kerplow!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a post-nuke irradiated hellscape, mechanized warfare evolves into its ultimate form: nuclear-powered Armored Flying Vehicles. Now, split-second death-duels are fought in the skies over the wastes of North America: from bootleggers to mercenaries, imperial armies to rock 'n' roll warlords, they all want their piece of the pie called Mega-Detroit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Speed Hover Tank is a fast-paced, card-driven-ish, dice-slinger's paradise. Ten unique models of Tanks - from the slick, speedy Viper, to the paralyzing Falcon, to powerhouses like the monstrous Tiamat - give players new tactical and strategic challenges in each scenario. A deck of Action Cards  enhances your options, and keeps you in doubt as to what your opponent can do, while the aptly-named Kerplow! Deck can change the battlefield dramatically or suddenly bring the game to a close. No scenario is going to play out the same way the second time around.&lt;br/&gt; To top it off, there are 10 scenarios for you to choose from. Punch a hole through elite Canadian armor. Out-bid your opponent for the services of Dido Blackhammer and her Death-Dodgers. Fight it out at point-blank range in the middle of a radiation storm. Or try to befriend Ethel, the Deranged, Homicidal, Also Terribly Lonely, Sentient Nuclear Tank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Speed Hover Tank is a glorious sandbox of action and excitement. So, fire up your nitro-boosters, roll your dice, and knock 'em out of the sky!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
