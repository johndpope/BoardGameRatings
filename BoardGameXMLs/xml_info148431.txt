			<description>Children's educational game about European flags. Players roll two dice with a colour on each face, and must find a tile showing a flag containing the two resulting colours, and then place it on the right space on the map which forms the game board. Each correct match and placement yields a coin; identifying and placing one's own country's flag gives a bonus coin in addition to this. The player who has collected the most coins when all tiles have been placed is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No upper limit on the number of players is given or implied; at least up to five players seems reasonable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
