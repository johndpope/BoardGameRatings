							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dig Down Dwarf (Second Edition)</name>
									
			<description>Dig Down Dwarf is a fast-paced press-your-luck dice game that was the winner of the Micro Game Challenge! 128 designs were entered into the contest and Dig Down Dwarf was unanimously picked #1 overall by the judges! The Micro Game Challenge was judged by board game critic Cyrus Kirby, who is better known as Father Geek, and by the podcast team at All Us Geeks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dig Down Dwarf is a fast and casual game that is fun for all ages and all skill levels. Newcomers will be attracted to the easy-to-learn rules and press-your-luck mechanics, while skilled gamers will love the ability to alter dice rolls by spending gems and to activate special dwarven powers. There is a bit of something for everyone, and the quick playtime and portability make it a great travel game and an outstanding filler game as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is New in the Second Edition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective Cards - This new edition will come with 18 Objective Cards. Players will randomly draw 3 at the beginning of the game and these will become a way to score bonus points at the games end. Players decide, as a group, if the objectives are be kept secret or placed up for all to see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Artwork - Second Edition comes with clean new graphic design work and artwork throughout. You will still recognize some of the icons and fonts, but the new design is meant to convey a sense of nostalgia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More Gems - Second Edition comes with 20% more of the shiny gems that made the First Edition such a smash hit!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six Player Support - With the addition of extra gems and other components, Dig Down Dwarf Second Edition can host up to six players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Dwarf Power Cards - These new cards utilize acrylic cubes to track the dwarven skills you have unlocked during the course of the game, instead of rotating the card like you had to do in the older version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Dice Colors - Like the new Dwarf Power Cards, we have listened to the feedback over the course of hundreds of plays since the first Kickstarter over two years ago. One thing I noticed was players not noticing that they triggered a dwarf power, because each dice was a different color and it was too much to keep track of for many. A very simple solution has been implemented. You now roll three black dice and one red die on your turn. The red die activates everyone's dwarven powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Gem Colors - Another complaint we got was that some of the gems looked alike in color. We made sure to make that a non-issue this time around. Star gems are now really yellow and we are now able to manufacture the gems in black for the cursite (fossilized dragon dung) which further helps distinguish each gem type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
