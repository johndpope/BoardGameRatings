			<description>Publisher Advertisement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Flight Path package will let you experience all facets of modern day aviation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mountain Pilot transforms you into a daring bush pilot as you fly badly needed supplies to a remote gold mining camp. You'll have to cross a hazardous mountain range, while struggling with headwinds, tricky navigation and rapidly diminishing fuel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch your airspeed, altitude and rate-of-climb or you could stall-out and crash. If you deliver your supplies, you can't relax; you must return over those mountains with a heavy cargo of gold bullion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;O'Hare is a control tower simulation where you become an Air Traffic Controller. The lives of hundreds of people become your responsibility as you guide aircraft through your control sector to a safe landing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll have to deal with different aircraft requirements, wind change warnings and potential midair collisions. But no matter what happens, you must bring in twenty aircraft safely on your tour of duty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Precision Approach Radar combines the skills of pilot and Air Traffic Controller. You become the pilots' eyes as they try to land in limited visibility conditions. Your commands guide the aircraft on their approach to the field - and a safe landing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Flight Path package covers both sides of flight procedure, from the thrill of flying to the tense drama of air traffic control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
