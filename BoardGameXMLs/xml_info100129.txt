			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When it comes to aliens, everyone looks to the stars. But where they should be looking is right behind them. No alien worth his little gray pajamas is going to conquer Earth, abduct isolated hicks for anal probes, or even make friendly contact without doing a little reconnaissance first. Their advanced technology and skill at genetic manipulation makes the task of infiltrating human society easier, but by no means effortless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presented here are three alien intelligences that secretly perform missions here on Earth. They move about quietly, lurking on the periphery of our lives, quietly moving forward the alien machinations of their masters. Their ultimate motivations are mysterious; possibly they themselves do not know their ultimate goal. But their creators know, and that&amp;rsquo;s enough&amp;mdash;for now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
