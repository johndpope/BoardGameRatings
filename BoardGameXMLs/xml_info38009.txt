			<description>The goal of the game is to put all your 5 pawns onto the board, avoiding all the traps your opponents set. &lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses the character of his pawns (Kang, doctor Octopus, Magneto, doc Fatalis) and get 5 identical pawns with a drawing of this character. At the beginning of the game all players must be upon the same secret base (red or blue): they choose their places upon their secret cards. Pawns are moved accordingly to the result of the two dices in any direction. Any time a pawn reaches his secret base, his owner surrounds a new square on his secret card. But if he crosses a square surrounded by one of his opponents, he falls into a trap and must go back to his base, while the trapper(s) puts one of his tokens upon this square, and chooses another trapped square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
