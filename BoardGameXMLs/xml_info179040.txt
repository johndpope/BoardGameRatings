							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Miracle: The Battle of Midway</name>
									
			<description>Miracle is Two Generals Games' game on the Battle of Midway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 16 counters (game pieces) representing different kinds of aircraft, ships and even weather for each of the two players. As in the original battle, however, the kinds of units (game pieces) that each player has is different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since Miracle does not use dice, it may resemble Chess or perhaps Stratego to you. But both those games are abstract, while this is a strategic simulation of an historical battle from the point of view of the two overall commanders: Admiral Yamamoto for the Imperial Japanese Navy, and U.S. Navy forces sent by Admiral Chester Nimitz. Plus the sides are exactly equal in both Chess and Stratego - here each player has assets and liabilities based on the historical situation. For example, the US has fewer aircraft carriers than the Japanese, but has the unsinkable (but unmovable) Midway Island airbase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like both those games previously mentioned - and unlike most wargames - we do not use dice or any other random generator. This means the game emphasizes each players skills in strategy and in tactics to attain his own goals, or at least deny the other player his.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Miracle takes place on a water- and smudge-resistant vinyl map small enough to fit in a notebook. We even supply a ziplock plastic bag for the pieces and a resealable plastic cover for the map, making this a very portable game. The rules are short - two pages - and they're online at all times in case you forget to bring a printed copy. An entire game can be played in 35-45 minutes or less. It's quite possible to play a game during lunch, finish it, and switch sides and play it again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's easy to learn the rules and quick to play, but the game plays subtly and mistakes are costly. Take care with your forces! As in the original battle, the slightest mistake can cost you the outcome!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
