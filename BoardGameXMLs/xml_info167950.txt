			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1775 the simmering resentment of American colonists exploded into a bloody rebellion. Beginning in Boston, the conflict eventually stretched from Canada in the north to Florida in the south and lasted eight grueling years. On one side stood the King's redcoats and settlers loyal to their sovereign, later joined by regiments of 'Hessian' mercenaries. Ranged against them was a citizen army under the inspirational leadership of George Washington, supported by militia and eventually French troops eager to embarrass their old foe. Both sides were forced to learn new tactics for fighting in the wild terrain of North America in a conflict that saw heroism and ineptitude in equal measure. This supplement for Black Powder describes the history, armies, personalities and battles of this conflict. Included are scenarios allowing you to recreate many of the battles of the rebellion. This glorious 144-page full-color book, written by Steve Jones, comes with a free Continental officer figure sculpted by Alan Perry himself! Who else would you ask to design a new figure for an American War of Independence book? A copy of the Black Powder rulebook is required to use this supplement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
