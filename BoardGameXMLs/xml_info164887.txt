			<description>Three Weeks in Paradise is a computer game released in 1986 by Mikro-Gen for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC platforms. It is the last action-adventure platform game from the Wally Week series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This time the family of Weeks are trapped on a tropical island inhabited by cannibals. Herbert and Wilma (Wally's son and wife) are trapped and Wally must rescue them, build a raft and escape. The player only controls Wally and must solve puzzles and avoid obstacles like animals and natives - especially the tribe chief, who's patrolling the area. Each puzzle solved builds a piece of escape raft. As with previous Wally games humour plays an important part in both the gameplay and puzzle solving. The graphics were detailed and the Spectrum version had an option to switch off Wally's natural colour, which would remove the colour clash. In the ZX Spectrum +128 version there are few additional screens and objects to use, but the rest of the game remains the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Three Weeks in Paradise&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
