							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cyber Shinobi</name>
									
			<description>Cyber Zeed - the villains who previously tried to destroy the world - are back. Zeed's army is stealing plutonium from power plants around the world. Their goal is to melt this planet down. All the world's nations have joined forces in an attempt to put an end to this chaos. Thousands of troops have been sent out, but none of them returned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A lone ninja has appeared - the grandson of Joe Musashi, the brave ninja who defeated Neo Zeed years ago. He is the most skilled martial artist in the world and wielder of the four types of ninjutsu - fire, tornado, lightning and earth. He is the only hope. Cyber Zeed must be destroyed once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Cyber Shinobi&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
