			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terzo Tempo means, in Italian, Third Half: the friendly dinner that follow each rugby match. Terzo Tempo is a fast card game based on a system that allows you to choose between a covered and an uncovered card to try to advance toward the other team's goal line. Using your covered card you can also kick, try a drop, play a penalty. The game focuses on the mainstream of a match: you have to choose if you want to try a fast advance taking some risks or kick to push your adversary to a respectable distance from your goal line.&lt;br/&gt;The deck of 48 cards allows you to create teams of 5 different level. An entire 6 Nations can be played, by 6 players, in no more  than 2 hours.&lt;br/&gt;The game has been designed by a rugby player and tested on the field, drinking beer during hard Half Times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
