							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guide to the Realms of Aedenne</name>
									
			<description>From the foreword:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You know, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing like organizing something you&amp;rsquo;ve been working on in bits and pieces for almost two decades to make you realize just how much work you&amp;rsquo;d put into something. The Realms of Aedenne began life around 1986 as a rough map sketched on the back of a piece of cardboard during a game session. I had agreed to DM a one-shot game, and was prepared for a simple dungeon crawl. To my consternation, one player insisted on asking question after question about the cities in the area, what was beyond the wilderness, who was in charge of the region, etc. And so Aedenne was born.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since that time I&amp;rsquo;d taken a rough sketch and fleshed the world out in greater and greater detail. The final product is what you hold in your hands (or read on your computer screen) right now. Aedenne has detail in some areas, but much is left vague. This is intentional, so that the DM has the maximum freedom to interpret the Realms as they see fit. However, I hope enough detail has been provided so that there is a good basic framework for any GameMaster to work from in making the campaign setting something recognizable as Aedenne, and yet full of their own concepts and ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, read on, and I hope that whether you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a world to set your next campaign in or just a few ideas to experiment with in your own campaign world, that this Guide is what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
