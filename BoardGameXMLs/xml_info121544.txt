			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Common Criminals is the new planned series of modern/near future role playing supplements from Fishwife Games. Unlike many products that feature spandex clad super villains, cybernetic punks, or pale faced modern vampires, Common Criminals showcases a variety of interesting but otherwise &amp;quot;everyday&amp;quot; criminals. Each regular addition of Common Criminals will feature six different criminals along with detailed information. In addition to basic information, the products will list a set of character attributes to aid the Game Master (GM) in the conversion of the characters to the role playing game of the GM's choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product has been provided for free to give the gaming public a chance to see what is to be offered in the upcoming series. In addition to this promotional product, an upcoming [Common Criminals: Companion Guide] will also be released as a free pdf. The companion guide will contain information on character conversion, including a more detailed explanation of the presented attribute system as well as tips on how the GM can incorporate the characters into a variety of different settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
