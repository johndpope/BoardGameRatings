							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rum Run</name>
									
			<description>It&amp;rsquo;s the 1920s. There&amp;rsquo;s prohibition and... sadness. The townspeople cry out for an unsobering savior! You don&amp;rsquo;t know the first thing about brewing, but there&amp;rsquo;s rumor about of secret distilleries deep in the forest. If only you could find them, you could caravan back these barrels of liquid joy and become the pride of the town. That is, if the other would-be heroes don&amp;rsquo;t get to them first. Do you have what it takes to claim that oh-so-coveted title, Regent of Rum?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you like dominos, and you like mancala, then you'll love The Rum Run! At its simplest, this game entails building roads from the town center, acquiring barrels, and bringing them back. At its most strategic, you'll be at constant warfare with other players; racing them to distilleries, breaking their roads, building over them, and stealing their barrels. Be prepared to think not one or two, but six or seven moves ahead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
