							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frank Bruno&#039;s Boxing</name>
									
			<description>More than just another edition release, this modified version of Super Punch-Out!! was ported to the Commodore 64, the ZX Spectrum and the Amstrad CPC, and entitled Frank Bruno's Boxing. It was developed and published by Elite Systems exclusively in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of the nameable wire boxer, real-life boxer Frank Bruno stars as the protagonist of the game. Only the first three opponents of the Super Punch-Out!! arcade were included in the game; however, their names were changed. Bear Hugger was renamed &amp;quot;Canadian Crusher&amp;quot;, Dragon Chan was renamed &amp;quot;Fling Long Chop&amp;quot; and Vodka Drunkenski was renamed &amp;quot;Andra Puncharedov&amp;quot;. Five exclusive characters were added to the game: Tribal Trouble, Frenchie France, Raviolo Mafiosi, Antipodean Andy and Peter Perfect. This version of the game featured a KO meter, which was an early version of the Super meter used in modern fighting games, allowing a more powerful punch to be thrown when the bar was filled.  Frank Bruno was also doing promotion for the compilation Frank Bruno's Big Box, a collection of several different games including Frank Bruno's Boxing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encore Software later rereleased the ZX Spectrum version of Frank Bruno's Boxing as Frank Bruno's World Championship Boxing.  As in the original Punch-Out!!, the player assumes the role of a green-haired boxer, known by three initials, who works through the ranks of the WVBA (World Video Boxing Association). During matches, the player's boxer is viewed from behind as a wireframe (so the opponents can be seen). The player must time his punches, dodges and blocks in order to defeat the opposing boxer. Hints are given as to the opponent's next move by subtle eye changes (the white of the eyes turn from white to yellow), but the player must ultimately predict what moves the opponent will make and react appropriately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the player defeats the final opponent, the player will win the Heavyweight Belt, then defend it against the same characters that he has already beaten. Each successive time they are met, the opponents are harder and quicker. For each opponent, the player must knock them out within three minutes (three knockdowns guarantees a TKO, although the opponents will sometimes stay down on the first or second one). After the player's second loss, the winning opponent comes forward and taunts the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is housed in a modified upright cabinet. Like the previous game, it requires two monitors, one atop the other, for the game's display. The top monitor is used to display statistics while the bottom one is the main game display. Apart from this, the game is more or less a standard upright. The game has a joystick and three buttons. Two buttons control left and right punches, one for each arm. One button delivers an uppercut or knockout blow. Unlike the original Punch-Out!!, Super-Punch-Out!! also featured a joystick which could be pulled straight up (almost as if you were trying to yank the joystick out of the machine). Doing so caused your green-haired character to duck, which was crucial in beating certain opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Frank Bruno's Boxing&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
