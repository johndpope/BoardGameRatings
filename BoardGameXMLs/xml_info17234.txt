							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Whickers World</name>
									
			<description>A Family game for 2-6 players themed loosely around the TV Series Whickers World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameboard&lt;br/&gt;250 Question Cards (2000 questions)&lt;br/&gt;Dice&lt;br/&gt;Counters&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move round the board through a combination of dice throws and answering questions from the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During his turn a player earns the right to move any of his or her four counters by correctly answering the first question (of 6) on a card - this question normally refers to a picture on the reverse of the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The distance moved is determined by dice roll - this roll also being used to determine the number of the next question to be answered (from the same card).  If the player answers the question correctly they may roll the dice again and have another question asked (from the same card).  Play continues in this manner until a question is answered incorrectly or the same number is rolled twice on that particular card.  It is then the next player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is also influenced by certain of the cards and instructions written on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also an element of tactical play in that landing one of your counters on the same square as another player's counter you send that counter back to that player's start point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to take all of their four counters around the world (the board) from their start to their finish point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
