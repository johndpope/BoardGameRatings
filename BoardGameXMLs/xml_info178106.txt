							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deadlands Noir Player&#039;s Guide</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This electronic document was created by Pinnacle Entertainment Group. It is not for redistribution or resale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It contains the first 49 pages of Deadlands Noir--the Player's Section--and is intended for the Game Master to purchase and share with the players of his or her campaign. For this reason, Pinnacle hereby grants the Game Master a &amp;ldquo;Site License&amp;rdquo; to share this document for up to five players in his or her personal game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;            &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Orleans, 1935. Whoever called this &amp;ldquo;the Big Easy&amp;rdquo; sure got that one wrong. Things are tough all over. Honest work is hard to find, and even dishonest jobs are getting scarce. The one thing that&amp;rsquo;s not in short supply is trouble. From shady thugs to crooked cops to Mafia soldiers, there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of characters out there looking to give an honest Joe a hard time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s not the worst of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are stories going round about things that go bump in the night. Things you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to meet in a dark alley on a darker night. And those stories aren&amp;rsquo;t just coming from rummies or saps who read that Epitaph rag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Still, there are a few heroes left in the concrete jungle. Steely-eyed private dicks, fast-talking grifters, wild-eyed inventors, and shadowy houngans still struggle against the encroaching darkness. With enough moxie&amp;mdash;and more than a little luck&amp;mdash;they might just be enough to turn the tide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
