							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Terrible Tale of Pride and Prescience</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lady Blackwood has yet another new expensive hobby - the realm of spirtualism and speaking to those beyond the mortal coil. Why she felt the need bring in the infamous Madame Petroishka to speak to the dead is beyond understanding - just go into the library at midnight. Nevertheless, the staff at the Hall are tasked with maintaining a stiff upper lip and their normal impeccable service during the Madame's stay... hopefully it will be short.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the second Terrible Tale adventure for Monkeyfun Studios' dreadpunk RPG, Bedlam Hall.  Powered by the Apocalypse, players take the terrible role of servants for the Blackwood family who are quite&amp;hellip; different. The family&amp;rsquo;s troubles run the gamut between inconvenient relationships to terror-driven psychoses that can turn bloody and violent. Not quite the best employers to work for, in any sense of the word. Coupled with the house&amp;rsquo;s own peculiarities and a overwhelming need to maintain one&amp;rsquo;s own skeletons in the closet, every member of staff has their hands full to say the least.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you manage to survive the strange happenings and the family&amp;rsquo;s unnatural behavior while still keeping the house under control and your references in order? Play to find out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
