			<description>There are 4 different moving playing pieces in two colors: 1 favorite, 1 herold, 5 servants and 4 mounted knights. The players have to get their favorite into the opposite castle or capture the enemy favorite to win the game. On the game board, which looks like a chess board,  only the red and green spaces are used. Movement is diagonal. The brown spaces in the middle of the game board between the red und the green area are safe spaces (Asyl).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The favorite moves 1 space in any direction. &lt;br/&gt;The herold moves 1 or 2 spaces in any direction.&lt;br/&gt;The mounted Knights move 2 spaces in any direction and can jump over other piecess, they may not occupy Asyl. &lt;br/&gt;The servants move 1 space in any direction. Knights and servants may not move backwards till their own favorite has passed Asyl and is on the enemy half of the game board.&lt;br/&gt;Any piece can capture any enemy piece if it moves onto the space it is occupying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
