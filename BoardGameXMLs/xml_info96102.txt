			<description>Cho Aniki is the first game in the Cho Aniki series. It was originally released in 1992 on the PC Engine only in Japan. Years later, the game was released on the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan, North America, and Europe. This makes it the first time any game of this series has seen release outside Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's plot, involves the heroes moving through various locations &amp;mdash; space, urban environments, elaborate ruins &amp;mdash; and fighting alien invaders. Bo Emperor Bill (Botei-biru, a pun of bodibil, a short of bodybuild in Japanese), the man who achieved ten consecutive victories in the Great Galaxy Bodybuilding contest, faces an ever decreasing supply of protein. He unilaterally invades neighboring star systems, in order to establish protein factories to replenish his supply. Feeling threatened, the heaven realm sent Idaten and Benten to vanquish Bo Emperor Bill. Thus the sweaty hot battle between the muscle brothers (aniki) and Builders Army begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cho Aniki (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
