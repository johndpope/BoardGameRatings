			<description>In Tempo Tempo, the players have to match patterns to animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, each player receives a set of animal cards (cow, rabbit, dog, cheetah, hyena and ladybug). There is also a deck of pattern cards; each of these cards shows a pattern that appears on one of the animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in rounds. Each round, someone reveals a pattern card, then players must race to play the matching animal card. The first player to play an animal may keep the pattern card if he played the right animal; he then returns the animal card to his hand. If he played the wrong animal, both his animal card and the pattern card are discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all pattern cards have been revealed, the player who has collected the most pattern cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
