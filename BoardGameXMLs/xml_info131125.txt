							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Thanksgiving Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a party game designed to be enjoyed by a family during Thanksgiving dinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is provided with &amp;quot;Thanksgiving Cards&amp;quot; and writes down what he or she is thankful for this year. Examples include a promotion at the office, a new house, or the USA! A moderator chosen from among the contestants reads each response and the other players attempt to guess who filled out that card. The player with the highest number of correct guesses is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes cards, score pads, answer sheet covers, rules, and a storage insert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
