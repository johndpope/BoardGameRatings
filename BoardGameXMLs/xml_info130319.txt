							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Playroom (1989)</name>
									
			<description>This video game featured Pepper Mouse and was set in his playroom. Features included the spinner, which taught kids how to count; an ABC book, where kids could place objects wherever they wanted on the screen; the computer, which taught kids to spell; the cuckoo clock, which taught kids to tell time; the mousehole game, which was a dice-rolling game; and the mix-up toy, where kids could arrange heads, torsos, and legs from various characters to create others. A sequel to this game, called The Backyard, was released in 1993. It featured several new games, including tic-tac-toe, an animal matching game, and a clip art storybook illustrator that could save players' storybooks.&lt;br/&gt;This game is a part of the Early Learning Family series of children's video games along with The Treehouse, The Backyard, and Kid Pix Deluxe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Playroom&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
