			<description>Word creation game using cards printed with individual letters placed onto the table in grid format. Players construct words using adjacent consonants and any of three vowels available for that round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consonants count positively towards player score, wheres as vowels subtract points. The letter Y is the exception in both of these cases, losing the player points when used as a consonant but gaining the player points when used as a vowel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The contents in the box allow for three different ways to play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Classic Contest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players construct as many unique words as possible within a given time limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Most Valuable Word&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose a single word from those they construct within a given time limit. The player with the highest-scoring word wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Elimination Challenge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players compete to construct words in a &amp;ldquo;shout it out&amp;rdquo; format. The letters used are removed from play until no new words can be formed. The scores on each consonant card are added. The person with the highest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
