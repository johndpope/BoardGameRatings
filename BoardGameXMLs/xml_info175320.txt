			<description>DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;Your family is away on vacation and having a blast.  Unfortunately, your big sister was not able to come along.  Since you're at the arcade for the afternoon, you've decided to get her the best prize you can in the redemption center to bring home.  Your family thinks that is a great idea, and wants to do the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since your family is a little competitive, everyone wants to get the most tickets for the best prize.  It's game on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OBJECTIVE:&lt;br/&gt;Gain as many redemption tickets as possible by playing games with your limited coins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY:&lt;br/&gt;Players play games of various difficulty by matching tiles based upon color, shape, and numbers.  Half of the players will be active each turn.  Each turn is timed, so players have a limited time to complete matches.  The more matches made, the higher the prize.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME ELEMENTS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Timed tile matching&lt;br/&gt;    Variable game difficulty, with higher risk/rewards&lt;br/&gt;    Each player is active (at least) every other turn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
