							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pointless: The Travel Game</name>
									
			<description>POINTLESS, it&amp;rsquo;s the game where the most obscure answer is the best answer! Based on the witty and compelling BBC 1 TV quiz show, this travel game brings the fun and knowledge from the show into a game to play either on the move or sat at home with family or friends. The object of the game is to be the player or team with the LEAST number of points at the end of the six rounds. Players or teams give one answer to each question. There are two selections per question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
