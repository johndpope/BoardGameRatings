			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone Into the Slaughterhouse!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life in quaint, lazy Daytonville, Ohio used to be fairly tame - a night at the bowling alley, catching a movie, driving out to lookout point or taking a dip in the lake usually made for a full week. Then someone bought up all the slaughterhouses, meteors started falling from the sky and the green lightning showed up. After that, things got a little more complicated, what with some folks disappearing and others trying to suck out your bone marrow. There aren't any answers, but everything seems to point back to that strange, old mansion high on Harmony Hill - and a mysterious figure named Jacob X. Frost...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's Inside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;X is a complete adventure for Horror Rules, the Simply Horrible RPG, a horror comedy game of ridiculous proportions. This 32pg supplement is packed with everything you need to play, including Bad Guys, Cast, backstory, artwork, maps, Plot Pushers and enough Sequel Suggestions and Plot Twists to turn it into five adventures instead of one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
