			<description>The game consists of cards which show a grid of 10x10 squares. Within this grid, a number of squares are colored, and the size of this color field is also printed as a math question on top of the card (i.e. 6x8). &lt;br/&gt;The game is designed to teach basic math to elementary school children. Three game ideas are described in the rule booklet:&lt;br/&gt;- MAL seh'n: Each player places a card face down, then they are flipped over. The player with the highest card gets the trick&lt;br/&gt;- MAL niedrig: Players take turns playing a card, lowest number gets the trick&lt;br/&gt;- MAL &amp;auml;rgern: This game is inspired by 6 nimmt (as acknowledged in the booklet). Cards are put on that stack on the table which shows the nearest lower card. The player who can place a card with the same value as the top card on the stack gets the stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
