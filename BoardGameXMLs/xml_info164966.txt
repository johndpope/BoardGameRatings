							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oubliette: A Fantasy Adventure</name>
									
			<description>Oubliette is the classic multiplayer dungeon fantasy role playing game. Build a party of fighters, priests, mages and thieves to run deep into the dungeon. Test your courage and skill against groups of orcs, trolls, vampires and dragons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earning its reputation as the thinking man's dungeon game, Oubliette blends the thrill of mortal combat with the sublime challenges of strategy, planning and adaptation. Rather than testing your reaction speed and nerves, like a first person shooter, Oubliette challenges the player to do&lt;br/&gt;careful strategic planning as well as make tactical decisions in the heat of battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player (character) in the game is created from one of eight player races, which vary in attributes such as strength, intelligence, dexterity and durability. Elves are highly intelligent and (potentially) immortal, Orcs are strong with short life spans, Dwarves are strong with high wisdom, Kobolds are quite weak in most areas but advance more quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on these attributes, each player will be qualified to join a limited number of player classes (occupations). More balanced players will have more choices, including Hirebrand (fighter), Mage, Priest and Thief. Less commonly, players may be qualified for a highly selective class with special skills such as Ranger, Sage, Paladin, Samurai or Ninja.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike games which focus on a single player against multiple opponents, Oubliette allows a party of up to 10 players with complementary skills to face the various types of monsters found in the dungeon. There are more than 160 different monsters, and to deal with them, more than 150 different pieces of equipment, which may be enchanted with special properties or skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oubliette is challenging, - New players commonly have their parties wiped out by an unfamiliar group of monsters. In fact, your party can meet up to 3 monster groups at the same time! Use the Temporal Chamber to save a Temporal Portal before dangerous trips. If things turn out badly, use the Temporal Chamber to turn back the clock and try again. The trapeze is every bit as thrilling, but safer, with a net below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore the easier levels of the dungeon to build your party and expertise. And then, when you are ready, feel the power of the game on the deeper levels. Onward to Glory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
