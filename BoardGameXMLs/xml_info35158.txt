			<description>There is a place with no time or space, wandering on the eternity of an inexistent reality. The beginning of everything and the converge of nothing. Welcome a new era of fantasy, heroism and eternal battles. The Eprion era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a very distant world called Eprion, two races must face each other in a great battle. The game comes with two sets of cards and figures. The cards can be creatures or spells. Each creature card has an associated figure that can be played in the board. The board is composed by 6 modular boards which must be placed at the beginning of the game: forest, ice, desert, swamp, lake and plain. The position in which they are placed is very relevant, since the creatures abilities are affected by the kind of landscape they are standing in.&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first one in defeating the adversary&amp;rsquo;s leader, which is protected by 2 gemstones and his army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eprion is not just a game. It comes with a very well written book with the story of this world where you can learn about the story of almost every character of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
