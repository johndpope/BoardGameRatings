							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Gem Cutter&#039;s Guide</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book was written to introduce novices to becoming a Game Master. It doesn't explain an real rules, but instead focuses on show the Game Master how to handle situations and set her stage for adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is divided into five main sections. Every Game Master should know and understand the material in the Basic Storytelling and Non-Player Character chapters. The others can come with more experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In truth, however, most of the book will seem like common sense. It's surprising, though, to learn what every good Game Master forgets from time to time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
