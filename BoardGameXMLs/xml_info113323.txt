							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Royal Purple the Game of Kings</name>
									
			<description>The unusual features of this game are the moves of the Prince and his acquisition of the territory upon which he sets foot. A Prince moves up or down on a dice throw of 1 or 4. Moves right or left on a throw of 2 or 5, and diagonally on a throw of 3 or 6. A player places a Dominion Marker on all squares stopped on by his Prince, and no other player may trespass on that territory when so marked. This limits the squares a Prince may move to making and unusual situation, and calling for increasing skill as the game progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The person starting is determined by high roll. Turn moves to the left. Each player starts from his Corner Castle and is given a Prince, 30 Dominion Markers, and a die. Each player in turn rolls and places a Dominion Marker where the Prince lands. The first objective is to move to and place Dominion Markers on five Noble Squares (indicated by a purple board square with a white center). Then with the support of these five Nobles the Prince moves toward the Throne Space at the other side of the board. The first Prince to enter a Throne Space earns the right to wear the Royal Purple (wins).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays like a cross between popular games of the day Chess and Halma with a roll and move mechanic added. A number of &amp;quot;Go To&amp;quot; squares on the board jumping players ahead to another square are an added twist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
