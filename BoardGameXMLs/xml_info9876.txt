			<description>Be the first to put all your dishes on the tray and you'll win the game.  Stack up your dishes on Stretch-Out Sam's tray.  Press the lever and watch his arm stretch up,up and away.  Oh No!  The tray tips, dishes fall.  Now you'll have to keep them all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stacking Game of Spills &amp;amp; Thrills&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game features Manuel the waiter, who has an incredibly long arm.  At the start of the game you wind Manuel's arm into his body, place a plastic tray onto his raised hand and you're ready to play.  Each player is then given the same number of dishes (but not necessarily the same of each type) and then, in turn, each player flicks a spinner which tells him how many 3D objects to place on Manuel's tray - plates, bowls, glasses, cups and saucers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So far, it's just a simple balancing game.  But the spinner also tells you if you have to Tip The Waiter.  If you do, you have to reach behind Manuel and flick a lever which extends his arm a short distance.  The more the arm extends, the more unstable the tray of dishes becomes.  Eventually Manuel's arm tips and all the dishes fall off and are given to the person who caused Manuel to drop the dishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to get rid of all your dishes first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very similar in theme and name to Don't Tip the Waiter and Don't Tip the Waiter .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
