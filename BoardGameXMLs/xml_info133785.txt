			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Torque is a free to play, massively multiplayer online racing game; it is the North American version of the Japanese Level-R.  The game features tuning and customization of cars for better performance during races and, while free, offers small bonuses for small, optional payments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a host of race types, including the modes: Simulation, Arcade, Thunder Alley, Drag, Capture the Flag, and Drift.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Level-R and Project Torque are nearly identical save a few differences in the cars available to players, which arose due to licensing differences across the markets in which they were being presented to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
