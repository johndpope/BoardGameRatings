			<description>Hexomino is a logical game played on hex game board. The players place alternately six-colour plastic tiles on the board, so it matches at least two tiles on the board. Who can't place any tile onto the board, must draw three tiles. The player who first run out of tiles, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;There is a more complex variant of the game, in that every player place tiles on his/her own board, considering certain rules of simmetry of the tile's formations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
