			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 48 x 30 inch, full color battlemap of an Oasis Ruin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps (VTT) and has a 360 degree view.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;You would deny an old woman her last request for one last drink? You think you own this water because you live next to it? It belongs to the earth not to you. I curse you with my last breath, may your thirst be everlasting!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DramaScape brings a place for you to quench your thirst in the desert, but what happened to the nearby village?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oasis Ruins is a single exterior map of a desert oasis and a ruined village that was built around the oasis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oasis Ruins is intended for use in primitive, fantasy, historical or modern games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thirst!: By day, the village by the oasis is in ruins. At night, the village is lively with people walking around and intact buildings. However, any attempt to talk to these people reveals them as ghosts instead and touching the doors of the buildings reveals their ruined nature. The ghosts attempt to talk to the group, but there may be a language barrier, as they speak an ancient desert tongue. Frustrated by not being able to communicate, the ghosts may attack the group (they attack to stun rather than kill if possible). The ghosts try to tell the group not to drink the oasis water and how it came to be cursed if the group seems to understand their ancient desert language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wandering witch was dying in the desert and came to the village. Seeing her near death, the village refused to waste water on her. She died cursing the oasis village. Those who drink the waters of the oasis become thirstier with every drink of water. The people of the village all died bloated from water with their throats as dry as the surrounding desert. The ghosts are trying to warn them or at the very least chase them away from the oasis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another potential encounter in this scenario is the bloated corpses of the villagers as zombies, cursed to wander the desert seeking the water of the living.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
