			<description>&amp;quot;Myth&amp;quot; is an interactive video card game.  There are two levels at which the game may be played - for the Beginner level, players, via battles, must be the first to collect a set of 5 different warriors (Human, Elf, Goblin, Dwarf and Troll) of any number ('1', '2', or '3'), whilst in the Standard level players must battle to collect a set of 5 different warriors of the same number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles are resolved by players simultaneously playing numbered Warrior and Weapon cards and consulting a battle grid (player with the top total score wins the battle).  Depending on the result, Warriors and/or Weapons are then exchanged between the players or the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main feature of the game is an accompanying video (played during the game) which features the &amp;quot;Battlemaster&amp;quot; who dictates changes to the gameplay which will 'make certain only the best warriors (players) will prevail'.  This includes penalizing the current leader (by removing a Warrior card from their hand), helping the current loser, swapping/taking cards from another players hand, and other such winner-influencing actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was produced in Western Australia by a now apparently defunct games publisher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
