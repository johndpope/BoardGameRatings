			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is vibrant, the world is alive... You can taste salt on the wind, smell the black damp of the earth beneath your feet. The drums of the ancestors call out to the clans, their song carried to all the chiefdoms across the sea. These are the ancient islands of the Brothers, the islands of the Bronze Gods, and they are your home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find the pathways of the elders, winding into crumbling temples deep within the mountains. Sail across the glimmering water, to return with valuable goods and stories of strange places. Wage an endless battle against the merciless oceans, against the noble warriors of your sworn blood foes or against the terrors that lay in wait in the ruins of ages past. And above all, pay your respects to the spirits and the Gods, for it is theirs to decide the fate of all the tribes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taste the wine and sing the story in your spirit, for at this hearth we are all kin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bronze Gods is a 145 page self-contained campaign setting detailing the Island of the Four Brothers - home to the Bronze Gods. Contained within are rich background and cultural information, several new races and several complete character classes, settings specific equipment and magic types, new terrain and hazard rules, antagonists, allies and a series of adventure seeds. Bronze Gods is ideal for games masters looking for an alternative fantasy setting with a twist without needing to commit to multiple books to get started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
