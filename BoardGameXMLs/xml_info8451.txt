			<description>(from Simulations Workshop website:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tactical simulation of the Battle for San Juan Hill, fought on July 1, 1898 during the Spanish-American War. It was the largest land battle fought during the war, and the American victory would propel Teddy Roosevelt towards the White House. The battle was not as one-sided as most Americans think, as Spanish troops fought with bravery and grim determination, and inflicted 3 times their own casualties on the American forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic units in the game are regiments of infantry and dismounted cavalry for the Americans, companies and battalions for the Spanish, and batteries of artillery for both sides. &lt;br/&gt;The scale is 125 yards per hex, with 45 minutes per turn, and roughly 60 to 75 men per strength point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ranged fire, assaults, morale, leader casualties, step reduction, Gatling Guns, sharpshooters, the observation balloon, journalists, trenches, and the Sims-Dudley dynamite gun are all covered. Two scenarios, one covering the historical fight and one a &amp;quot;what-if.&amp;quot; Solitaire rules included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
