							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Talisman (4th Edition): Optional Characters</name>
									
			<description>Following the release of Talisman (Revised 4th Edition), Black Industries made a PDF available via their website which featured three optional Characters for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These characters were rehashes of ones found in the 2nd Edition of Talisman using artwork taken from Adventure cards in the latest release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gnome artwork was taken from the Adventure card of the same name, and the Character was based on the Leprechaun originally included in the Talisman Expansion Set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hobgoblin artwork was taken from the Adventure card of the same name, and the Character was based on the Hobgoblin originally included in the Talisman Expansion Set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pixie artwork was taken from the Fairy Adventure card, and the Character was based on the Sprite originally included in the 2nd edition The Talisman Dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One thing to note is that the Pixie character was originally to be a Nixie and use artwork from the Imp Adventure card, but it was thought that this looked a bit too evil!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
