							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shadow over Nentir Vale (Fortune Cards)</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadow Over Nentir Vale is the first set of 80 themed &amp;quot;booster&amp;quot; cards released by Wizards of the Coast for their Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 4e game (specifically designed for use with the D&amp;amp;D Essentials brand). The set of 80 cards are themed to fit into the setting material being released for 2011 (the newest D&amp;amp;D Encounters Season: The March of the Phantom Brigade and the upcoming Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale). The cards come in packs of 8 with one rare card (a small star appears on the bottom to indicate rare card). The cards come in three varieties: Attack, Defense and Tactic. A user-made deck needs to be somewhat balanced between these three types of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Fortune Cards, sold in booster packs of 8 cards, give players fun new ways to survive the challenges of the D&amp;amp;D Encounters in-store play program, as well as their home campaigns. These cards give characters fun, temporary benefits that feel different from the benefits gained from powers and feats, without adding undue complexity to the D&amp;amp;D game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of each encounter, shuffle your deck and draw a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play one card per round. It requires no action to play. The rules on each card state when you can play it and what effect it has. A card takes effect just once unless it states otherwise, and you discard the card when its effect ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can have only one Fortune Card in your hand at a time. At the start of each of your turns, you can do one of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Discard the card in your hand and draw a new one.&lt;br/&gt;    * Draw a new card if you don&amp;rsquo;t have one in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;    * Keep the card that&amp;rsquo;s in your hand if you haven&amp;rsquo;t played it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
