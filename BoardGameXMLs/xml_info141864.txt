			<description>Game designed to teach people about the new currency that was due to come into effect in Britain in 1971. Leans heavily on Snap but neatly expands the idea of seeing matching cards. You had to be alive at the time to know how people were worried about getting rid of pounds, shillings and pence. A decimal based currency is so much easier and sensible but the British people took some time to get used to it. Games like this helped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;1. Any number of persons may play this game.&lt;br/&gt;2. One player deals the cards in rotation until the pack is exhausted, giving a conversion table to each player.&lt;br/&gt;3. Each player keeps his cards, without looking at them, face down on the table in front of him. Then as his turn comes round he turns up the top card and places it before him, making another stack.&lt;br/&gt;4. If the top exposed cards on any two piles&lt;br/&gt;(a) two identical decimal currency cards (e.g. two cards both reading &amp;lsquo;25 new pence&amp;rsquo;), any player may call 'SNIP&amp;rsquo;:&lt;br/&gt;(b) two identical old currency cards (e.g. two cards both reading &amp;lsquo;10/-'), any player may call &amp;lsquo;SNAP&amp;rsquo;;&lt;br/&gt;(c) two cards expressing the same value but in different currencies (e.g. &amp;lsquo;1/-&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;5 new pence&amp;rsquo;), any player may call &amp;lsquo;SNIP-SNAP&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br/&gt;5. If the call is correct, the caller picks up the two piles concerned and adds them, face downwards, to his hand. If the call is incorrect, the caller must give each player one card face downwards from his hand.&lt;br/&gt;6. The player who eventually holds all the cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
