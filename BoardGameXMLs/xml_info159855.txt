							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Murder Urchin</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's something you can throw at your players to watch them chuckle, then squirm, then recoil in abject terror... We present to you the Murder Urchin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     It's big.&lt;br/&gt;     It's hungry.&lt;br/&gt;     It's extrodinarily hostile.&lt;br/&gt;     It has stabby natual defences.&lt;br/&gt;     It covers itself in poison.&lt;br/&gt;     It likes to bite.&lt;br/&gt;     Its feces-caked claws cause infection.&lt;br/&gt;     It curls up into a Prickly Ball of Contempt.&lt;br/&gt;     Its stench is a weapon.&lt;br/&gt;     It can become a rolling ball of death.&lt;br/&gt;     Its extraordinarily magic-resistant. &lt;br/&gt;     Have we mentioned it's angry? Oh, so angry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're looking to include a creature into your games that'll stink shake things up a bit, then check this out. We feel that absurd gallows humor grimdark is the way to go sometimes... There's nothing quite like some good laughs before the party is wiped out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this offering is system-neutral, some stats and such have been provided so that GMs with most rules systems should get idea on where to go with stats, abilities, and attributes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
