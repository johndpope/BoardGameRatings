			<description>A race game played on a rectangular board with Alquerque-style board topology (alternate spaces have 8 and 4 neighbors).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board represents space, and twelve regions of five spaces each are marked as &amp;quot;galaxies&amp;quot; numbered 1 through 12.  Each player has three spaceships, and the object of the game is to visit each galaxy with at least one ship, in numerical order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn each player rolls three dice and moves each of his/her spaceship the number of spaces shown on the corresponding die (the dice are differently colored to correspond to the three spaceships).  Spaceships may only enter the numbered galaxies in order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player scores 1 point when the spaceship enters a new galaxy, and scores a bonus of 3 and 5 points respectively if his/her second and third spaceships enter the same galaxy before the first one leaves.  The game ends when one player moves all three spaceships to the &amp;quot;exit&amp;quot; in one corner of the board, after galaxy 12.  The player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is from the book The KnowHow Book of Action Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
