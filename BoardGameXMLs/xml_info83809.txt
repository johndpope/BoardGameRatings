			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From 1 Samuel 17: 49 (King James Version):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Master at Arms returns with a new prestige class based on an ancient and potent weapon: the humble sling. The curse slinger combines arcane expertise with the skills of a master warrior, inscribing his sling bullets with dire curses to imbue them with potent, magical abilities. Able to hurl these cursed projectiles with terrible force, the curse slinger can slay his foes with a bone-shattering efficiency matched only by the most peerless archers and arbalestiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So make Philistines out of your enemies, and dent some skulls with Blackdirge Publishing and Master at Arms: Curse Slinger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Master at Arms - Curse Slinger contains 7 pages of new d20 material, which includes the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A historical look at the sling&lt;br/&gt;     Author's design notes&lt;br/&gt;     The curse slinger prestige class&lt;br/&gt;     Mynchrios, a jovial satyr curse slinger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
