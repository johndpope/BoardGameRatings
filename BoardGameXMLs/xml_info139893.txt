							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Nightmare of Abul Khared</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Science Gone Bad&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the life of a talented scientist is destroyed in the Depravity War, he seeks to find those responsible and make him pay.  What he finds, however, is a quick and dirty path to personal evolution, and the chance to become more than human.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, the quick and dirty path is often the most dangerous; what he becomes in his twisted quest is a greater monster than any he had previously pursued.  Now, he's a one-man Depravity War waiting to happen, equipped with technology millions of years beyond what the Earth is prepared to deal with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meet Abul Khared, follow his twisted journey, learn about his new technologies and the victims of his dread path to evolution.  Includes new Super Powers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a supplement for Hot Chicks: The RPG. You will need the core rulebook to play. As it contains strong sexual material and very disturbing content, you may also need a copy of our dark erotica supplement, Inner Darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also references to the events of Inner Darkness 2: The Depravity War and information in The Depravity War Companion... you may find those useful for reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
