							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Excalibur</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Excalibur, the most famous of all magical swords, was wielded by King Arthur. It was given to Arthur by the Lady of the Lake as a symbol of the sovereignty of the Britons, and is said to be &amp;quot;the finest sword that there was, which sliced through iron as through wood&amp;quot;. A jewelled, shining sword, Excalibur was engraved with words on both sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Excalibur had various magical properties: it was said to blind the wielder's enemies with a bright light, and that he who wore both sword and scabbard would not bleed from his injuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After Arthur's death, Excalibur was returned to the Lady of the Lake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
