							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Logical Spies</name>
									
			<description>You are a cunning and dastardly spy.  Deny it, you scoundrel! Use your skills of wit and observation to discover the other spies&amp;rsquo; identities and expose them before they expose you. The winner is the last remaining spy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Logical Spies unfolds like a social logic puzzle, in which the players play the role of a spy.  Your identity is represented by 6 cards: Nationality, Codename, Cover, Vulnerability, Secret Weapon, and special Agent ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round begins with the Spying phase and ends with the Accusations phase.  Spying is fast and simultaneous.  Recover your cards as quickly as you can while observing what other players do.  Accusations is calculating and methodical.  Consult your Logic Sheet.  Accuse other players until you make a false accusation.  As you make correct accusations, players must reveal that card.&lt;br/&gt;When your entire identity is revealed, you are out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 12 Agent cards add a special ability.  The Enigma may lie about his Codename.  The Assassin may wink at players to make them reveal a card.  The Die Hard gets 1 final round of accusations upon elimination...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
