			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Year of Celebrations is a continuing monthly log written by the traveling bard Digby O'Flannagan. In this log Digby describes the various holidays, celebrations and fairs that he has seen in his travels. This month Digby looks at the last month of summer - August. The days of August are still hot but the approach of autumn can be felt in the shortening days and cooling nights. So August is a month with a split personality of saying goodbye to the slow days of summer while also preparing for the hectic days of autumn ahead. This split nature has found its way into the many celebrations of August as well, and so, as Digby would say, &amp;quot;Keep a merry soul&amp;quot; and let's see what August has to offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This small product contains a month summary, alternate historical and fantasy names for the month and four fully fleshed-out holidays. This product also includes a game master section with an in-depth month theme discussion and advice on using each of the holidays presented in your game including unique plot hooks for each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
