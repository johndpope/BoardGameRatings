			<description>&amp;ldquo;Simplistic Simulation of the Crimean War 1854-56. One player is the Russians. The other player is the Allies (Anglo-French). Victory: The first player to win 7 Battles is the winner. If you have ever won 3 more battles than your opponent, you win. If a player is reduced to zero Troop Tokens he loses.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players draw cards from a common deck. Reinforcement Cards add to your Troop Tokens. Epidemic Cards are played to eliminate your opponent&amp;rsquo;s Troop Tokens. Battles are fought with Attack, Defense, and Blunder cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
