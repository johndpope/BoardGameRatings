							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Universalis (First Edition)</name>
									
			<description>Universalis is the game where every player is the Game Master; the game where players can create and populate the world as they desire--as they play; the game where everything that happens, happens because a player wanted it to happen; the game where suspense comes from the actions o the other players, not from a random roll; the game whose plot evolves as you play with no random table, rail-roading, or scenario books; the game which requires absolutely no set up or preparation time; the game where it doesn't matter if all the players show up on time or at all.&lt;br/&gt;Begin play with only sheets of blank paper, pencils, ten-sided dice, tokens, and plenty of imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
