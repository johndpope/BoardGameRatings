			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the second book in Vigilance Press' World of Arkara setting for the OSRIC system!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World of Arkara is the type of setting you remember, an open-world sandbox with its pulp roots intact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Canterbury Isles are an idyllic region, once the western edge of the mighty Kingdom of Damask, they were set adrift when that empire descended into the flames of anarchy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since then, the largest human settlement in the region, Bondaea, has become a city obsessed with order, dominated by the priests of lawful deities, the Duke has turned the city into a police state, with random identity checks and the gates separating the four quarters of the city locked at night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worse, the Duke has fallen under the spell of Therran the White, god of racial purity and forced all demi-humans in the city into the slum quarter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This action, combined with the clear-cutting of human loggers on the island has move the humans and elves to the edge of a race war that will devastate the isles forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now is the time for heroes.
