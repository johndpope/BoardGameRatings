							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bushido: Lady Oka</name>
									
			<description>Lady Oka is as deadly as she is beautiful. Raised in the luxury of Ryu she is a great power in the court and has learned to use the weapons gifted to her just as expertly as those crafted of polished steel and lacquered wooded in the dojo. A nimble and dexterous warrior she wields the traditional weapon of a lady of the samurai caste, with a natural ease and elegance. She moves across the battlefield with the poise and grace of a dancer, avoiding blows and missiles as if they were not even there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blister contains one model, one 30mm base and one full colour profile card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
