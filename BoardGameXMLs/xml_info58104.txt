							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Biboly: Noah</name>
									
			<description>Welcome to the world of Biboly. Biboly was developed in order to combine Christian experience with the thrill of playing Rummy. In Biboly, you will interact with one another through prayer, scripture reading, song and praise while playing a rummy style of game, trying to be the first to reach 100 points. And, you will have a bunch of fun while doing both. Play your melds, send out doves, interact ... but, if the dove doesn't return, there's dry land. You win! This game was created in 1999.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
