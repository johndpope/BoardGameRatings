			<description>&amp;quot;Tempest 2000 is a 1994 remake by Jeff Minter of the Dave Theurer 1981 arcade game classic, Tempest, for the Atari Jaguar. Originally being exclusive to the Atari Jaguar, the game received critical praise for its 3D graphics, soundtrack, and gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tempest 2000 modifies the gameplay of the original Tempest by adding bonus levels, collectible power-ups, more sophisticated enemy types, and wildly varying web (level) designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains a total of 100 webs, with new frame colors and variations every 15 levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ports:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tempest 2000 was ported to PC's running DOS, Macintosh, Sega Saturn and PlayStation game consoles, the latter version with several changes to the design under the name of Tempest X3. Interplay released a Microsoft Windows version later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DOS version contains optional AdLib and Roland MT-32 versions of the music. The Windows version is rendered in higher resolution, and has some unique glitches, like registering bonus level scores incorrectly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sega Saturn version, programmed by High Voltage Software, uses a limited amount of sound channels, causing thin sound. In this version, the third type of bonus level has been completely removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tempest X3, the PlayStation version, was released on November 30, 1996, with updated graphics and sound. [Tempest X3 is actually a newer remake of Tempest, which included Tempest 2000 as an unlockable bonus game.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reception:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tempest 2000, though initially dismissed by the creator of the Atari Jaguar], is generally regarded as one of the best video games for the system. Of particular critical acclaim was the game's intense techno music soundtrack. Tempest 2000 was awarded Best Jaguar Game of 1994 by Electronic Gaming Monthly.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tempest 2000&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
