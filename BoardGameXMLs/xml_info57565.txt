			<description>Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starship Troopers: the Roleplaying Game transports you to a terrifying far-future where mankind battles the rapacious Arachnids in a struggle for supremacy, in a game of high-octane excitement, danger and glory on the battlefields of far-flung star systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Starship Troopers: the Roleplaying Game, you take on the role of a Mobile Infantry Trooper, a member of humanity's most advanced armed force. Battling across space in a desperate struggle for the control of a galaxy you will not just be fighting for your life- but for the survival of your species. Arrayed against you stand the Arachnids, a vicious insect-like alien race bent on the absolute annihilation of mankind. Spreading like a virus throughout the galaxy, the arachnids are the greatest threat mankind has ever faced. These bugs can smell blood from a kilometre away, through skin, through suits, through steel; they feel no pain; they have no emotions and their only desire is to kill you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The odds are not all stacked against you, however. You are a part of the most highly-trained and well-equipped army in the history of mankind. Your weapons can scythe through hordes of warrior bugs, your powered armour is completely sealed and will protect you against all kinds of hostile atmospheres and environments. While wearing your power suit, you are stronger, tougher and better equipped to survive than any soldier in human history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Never forget that you are fighting for the very survival of the human race. Show your enemies no mercy for you can expect none in return. Shoot straight and shoot often.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Mobile Infantry, Trooper!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
