			<description>In Linnapeli, each player first draws a tile telling which castle(s) out of six possibilities is/are to be built. With 4&amp;ndash;6 players each player builds one castle, with 3 players 2, and with 2 players 3 castles. Players then pick tiles and place them on 4*4 grid, trying to avoid errors in placing the tiles or taking tiles that do not belong to their castle(s). The first player to complete his/her castle(s) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three variations to the gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;1) The easy variation is to keep the common heap of tiles face-up, and the game box with pictures of the castles visible to the players.&lt;br/&gt;2) The hard variation is to keep the common heap of tiles face-up but show the pictures of the castles only shortly in the beginning of the game.&lt;br/&gt;3) The hardest variation is to keep the common heap of tiles face-down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The castles to be built are Kastelholma, Turun linna, Viipurin linna, Kuusiston linna, Olavinlinna and Kajaanin linna.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
