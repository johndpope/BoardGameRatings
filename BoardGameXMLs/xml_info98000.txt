							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sooty Saves Sixpence</name>
									
			<description>Card game using ideas from a regular card game called Casino. The cards all feature Sooty but they also have amounts of money on each one, ranging from 1 penny to 1 shilling (that is 12 pennies). Four cards are laid face-up in the middle of the table and each player is dealt 4 cards. In your turn you can take a card from the display by using a card with the same value from your hand. Alternatively, you could add a card from your hand, and add it to the amount on the card on the table, with a view to taking it next turn with a card equal to the total on the two cards which you were 'building'. However, before your next turn comes round, another player might be able to take your 'build'.&lt;br/&gt;There are special cards that score more than normal.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the pack runs out. Cards you captured are added up, their face value in money. Then any Lucky Pennies score as 1 shilling. Any Lucky Sixpence scores 2 shillings. Any Money Boxes score 4 shillings and twopence. The player with the most in his 'savings' wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
