							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Wood and Taiga Giants</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Larger Than Life Foes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents game statistics for the mythic wood giant and mythic taiga giant, both of which have unique abilities never seen elsewhere, and are suitable for use as foes in both mythic and non-mythic games. Mythic taiga giants (CR 15) can conjure up the ghosts of his ancestors to fight on his behalf, and harness the mystical power of the aurora. Meanwhile, mythic wood giants (CR 7), are expert archers whose shots are never blocked by trees and foliage, who can travel instantly between trees, and who can bend the very plants of the forest to their will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
