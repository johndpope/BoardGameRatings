			<description>From the Publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Races in Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 4E are good for laying down the broad strokes of a character, but they often don&amp;rsquo;t feel as &amp;ldquo;lived in&amp;rdquo; as the ethnicities we encounter in everyday life. One potent reason for this is a general lack of cultural complexity and diversity. D&amp;amp;D races tend to be presented as monocultural societies&amp;mdash;all elves are the same the world over, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hard Boiled&amp;trade; Cultures aims to make it easy to change that, outlining versatile, easy methods for diversifying the ideas of culture and race in your D&amp;amp;D 4E game. Better yet, the methods break down how to give this diversity real weight in the system, rather than simply relying on &amp;ldquo;color&amp;rdquo; text to do the job. Fred Hicks and Jonathan Walton show you how to reverse-engineer cultural cues out of an existing race writeup, and then create nigh-limitless possibilities for other cultures within that race once the building blocks are made plain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this 17-page PDF you&amp;rsquo;ll find a clear, well-documented methods for culture building, a culture building worksheet, tribes of elves, apelord intellectuals, and a dark faerie spin on dwarves. Your campaign worlds will never be the same again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
