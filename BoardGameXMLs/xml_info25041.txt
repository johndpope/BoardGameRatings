			<description>A HABA Minispiele key chain game simulating a horse race with two jumps. It contains 12 sticks, four circular tokens and two wooden horses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four circular tokens are blank on one side. On the reverse, three of them have a picture of a clover leaf and one has a picture of a jump. On their turn, the player places the tokens in the box, shakes the box and secretly looks at the tokens. They then declare which tokens are in the box, however, they can bluff. If unchallenged, the player moves according to the tokens they say they have (one space for each clover, and a jump required to clear each obstacle) and their turn is over. If challenged they display the contents of the box. If they were telling the truth they move accordingly and have another turn. If they were lying no movement occurs and their turn is over. First past the post wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
