							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The DawgFather</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 4-page adventure utilizes the DAWG rules system and is designed for two or more Dawg characters. The adventure begins in the abandoned animal shelter of a dying town, from which escape means freedom and the run of the town - but also means drawing the attention of the town's top dawg. Will the players tuck their tails between their legs and do the DawgFather's bidding, or bare their teeth and fight? After all, there can be only one leader of the pack...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: The DawgFather was originally published in Knights of the Dinner Table #153, and is also available as a PDF download.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
