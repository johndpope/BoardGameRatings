							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Spam Emails to Find</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a list of spam emails that could be found on a computer in a modern or futuristic setting. In such settings, computers are common, and players will commonly investigate them. As well as anything useful, spam will also be a common problem, whether on investigated devices or on their own. This provides a list of 100 different spam emails to find. Each comes with a title for the email - which may well be misspelled or nonsensical - and a brief overview of the contents. Should players decide to open attached files or visit linked websites, they will deserve whatever the GM decides to do to the device in question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With some emails being of a more mature nature, even though the language is not explicit, these should probably not be used with children, although the product isn't really adult in nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Important Notice From FBI - Claims to be from the Anti-Terrorist and Monetary Crimes Division of the FBI in Washington, D.C., and that millions of dollars has been cleared to be paid to the recipient, they simply need the appropriate identification documents first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page of the supplement is the front cover and most of another the introduction and front matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
