							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cabin in the Woods</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Cabin in the Woods, the characters may have been hired to deal with a group of bandits or otherwise have heard of them. The bandits have a cabin in a clearing in the woods but the characters are not the only party looking for the bandits, and it is possible that the characters, and the other party, are both disguised as bandits, leading to several potential outcomes when the actual bandits arrive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is aimed at d100 systems but is generic enough in nature to be adapted to others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure comes with an 24&amp;quot;x24&amp;quot; square battlemap of the cabin and the clearing taking up twelve pages that can be printed out and assembled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the cover, one the front matter, one page is ads and one page has instructions on assembling the battlemap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
