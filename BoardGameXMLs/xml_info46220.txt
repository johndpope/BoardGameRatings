			<description>Player's using Player's Handbook Power Cards don't need to crack open a rulebook every time they cast a spell all the crucial information is right in front of their eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each and every class power appearing in the Player's Handbook has its own card. Simply select the cards for your character's powers and you're ready to play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each deck of 100 cards includes all the powers from Player's Handbook for one of the eight classes featured in the book, plus a few blank cards for players to use for other powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
