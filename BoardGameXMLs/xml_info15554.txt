			<description>Beer and pretzel game. One player (A) gets one black figure, the other player (B) 6 figures in different colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is:&lt;br/&gt;- For player A: To catch all the colored Figures&lt;br/&gt;- For player B: To bring at least one figure to the other side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player A gets a die (D6) with two black sides and one orange side. &lt;br/&gt;Player B gets a die (D6) with 6 different colors, matching his figures..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player A starts rolling the die. If he rolls black he can move his figure one space (front, side, back). If he lands on a space with a colored figure, he catches this figure. This figure is then placed on a space in the goal line, blocking it. If he rolls orange and has already captured a figure he can change the position of one of his captured figures on the goal line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player B moves the playing piece according to the rolled color on the die. He may move one space forward or to the side. If there is a figure on the space on he landed on, he pushes this figure one space further.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy, fast, fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
