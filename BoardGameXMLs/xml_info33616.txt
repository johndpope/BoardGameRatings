			<description>A cutlass slashes through the sea breeze, smoke fills the air, a shout of &amp;quot;prepare for boarders!&amp;quot; echoes across the water, two ships pull closer as men run to the rails. You are about to enter the world of FreeBooters. Pirate adventure through the sea fights, fort battles, sacking of towns, and battles for treasure and fame. Can you as the Captain of the fort prevent the crew from rescuing their freebooter captain? As a freebooter, can you get your treasure back to your ship through the jungle, avoiding the enemy ambush? Do you risk crossing Danger Falls or hack your way through the jungle facing quicksand and gators?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight your way across the seas, jungles, towns, islands, and forts of the Caribbean in this game of sword fights and adventure&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freebooters showcases man to man sword fights in the style of Worthington's popular COWBOYS game. Cards will reflect the variables of the fighting style of the golden age of piracy as well as some of the personality unique to this time.
