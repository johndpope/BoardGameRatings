							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Understanding Alignment for Tabletop Roleplayers</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alignment is possibly the most hotly debated element in traditional roleplaying games. Many people find it to be a useful way to get a handle on character motivation. Others find it far too vague to be an effective tool. It is literally two-dimensional and absolute; a person is either good or evil, lawful or chaotic, or a perfect balance. There is no room for subtlety or nuance in the rules as written.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even different editions of games using alignment offer varying explanations of what combinations are possible, and what those mixtures mean.  In systems that otherwise provide numeric representations and statistical models for success and failure, alignment is open to interpretation. Aside from some restrictions on and prerequisites for character abilities, it's left for players and gamemasters to sort out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet alignment remains virtually unchanged where other elements of classic fantasy roleplaying have either evolved or fallen away. The reason is because arguing about alignment can be fun. We want alignment to make sense. People like to discuss whether a celebrity, historical, or fictional character is one alignment or another. Memes are shared, online quizzes are generated, and motivational posters are created. All of which goes toward developing some meaning and practical utility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not the definitive resource on alignment. The topic is so subjective that nothing could be. What this book presents is one possible interpretation of alignment, and a system for using it to enrich your game. It presents an alternate way to describe alignment, as a means of customizing your character's personality, goals, and beliefs. There are simple mechanics to reward characters who embody the tenets of their alignment, and penalize those who stray. If it doesn't answer all of your questions about a character's stance toward morality, you should at least find enough fodder to continue the never-ending conversation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
