			<description>Status Report! is a 10-20 min social deduction game for 3-5 players. One person acts as the Captain of a spaceship and everyone else plays the ships on-board AI. Unfortunately for the Captain only one of these AI is still operational, decided by a role cards, the rest are out to kill them and the crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is broken up into 8 rounds with varied actions. On the odd rounds Ai will play casualty cards killing crew members. On the even the Captain is given special actions to help determine which Ai is actually on their side. If the Captain can identify the Operational Ai or keep his crew alive until the end of all 8 rounds they win the game. Otherwise the Rampant Ai kill the crew and take control of the ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
