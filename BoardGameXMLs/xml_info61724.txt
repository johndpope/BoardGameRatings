							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of English Blood Royal</name>
									
			<description>Game consisting of 80 cards. 36 cards represent monarchs. These show a woodcut portrait in an octagonal frame, and list numerous facts such as dates, names of parents and spouses, major events and people of their reign, and manner of death. 43 represent nobility close to the crown, and list facts without portraits. The 80th card gives the rules of the game, which is intended to teach English history.&lt;br/&gt;Who could forget that Henry II died of vexation, John, Duke of Bedford, of mortification and anxiety, or Henry I of eating lampreys?.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
