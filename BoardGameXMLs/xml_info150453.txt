							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Principality of Innspa and the Adri Marchland</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innspa (pop. 12,200) is a unique city in Aerdy. It is located just within the edge of the westernmost border of the Adri, about five miles from the fringes of the forest. It has a walled core (&amp;quot;Old Town&amp;quot;), but the rest of the settlement, down the Harp River, is unwalled, with the outer dwellings protected only by a small, semicircular ditch. Most houses in Old Town are built of stone, and many reveal the handiwork of dwarven or gnomish stonemasons, though demihumans are very rare here now. As befits the second part of its name, the town is a place of bubbling springs. Besides these baths and centers that promise various sorts of invigoration and cures, the city place has more hostels, taverns, and inns than most other communities across the Flanaess&amp;mdash;hence the first part of its name. Innspa also boasts dozens of religious buildings, ranging from small shrines to large temples and great cathedrals, owing to the multitude of religions found in the region. Travelers often marvel at the intricacies of Innspa's gnomish aqueduct.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
