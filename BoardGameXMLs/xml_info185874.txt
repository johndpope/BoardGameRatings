			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generic destines is in most respects a fairly straightforward generic, universal roleplaying system.  It's major innovation involves a system of dice management to produce intrinsically limited percentile rolls for action resolution.  Actions are rolled against a target difficult noted as a percentage.  Instead of using traditional d100s, however, the system replaces one or both of the 2d10 with other dice.  For example, an unskilled character may roll 1d4/1d10 to generate a &amp;quot;percentile&amp;quot; roll of 01-49 whereas a highly skilled character might roll d12/d10 for the same task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have five Stats (Attributes):  Combat, Body, Awareness, Intellect, and Technique.  Stats have values between 4 and 12 in a discontinuous range (4, 6, 8, 10, 12).  The Stats value determines which type of die is used for &amp;quot;percentile&amp;quot; rolls.  Characters likewise have Skills, which are player-defined.  Skill Levels range from 4-10 also in a discontinuous range (4, 6, 8, 10), and also aligned with the type of dice used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
