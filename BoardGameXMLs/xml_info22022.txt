							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lil Squirt</name>
									
			<description>A children's dexterity game from the 1950s that is very similar to the game &amp;quot;Tickle Bee&amp;quot;.  The display is mounted on a yellow board and comes with a &amp;quot;magnetic skunk chaser&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;A player must navigate the skunk through the simple maze under such red-colored objects as a ladder, a piper, a pig, a drum, a rock tunnel, a covered bridge, a haunted house, a drain pipe, or an old stump.  However, one should be careful to not to get too close, or the skunk will &amp;quot;spray&amp;quot; (lift up off the board and touch the wand).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Lil Squirt likes to run and play but don't get too close, or he will spray.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
