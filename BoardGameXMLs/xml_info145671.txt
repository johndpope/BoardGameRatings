			<description>Welcome to the world of Diggin Deep Boxing!!! With Diggin Deep Boxing you can experience all the majesty and drama of boxing on the tabletop.  Diggin Deep Boxing is a round by round simulation of the game of boxing, complete with everything you would find in a real life boxing ring.  You might even find a few surprises as you would in an actual boxing match.  Maybe you suffered a vicious cut above your eye.  Will it heal?  Will it affect your ability to continue to fight?  Maybe one of the judges is paying off a gambling debt.  Will he be scoring the bout in your favor, or in your opponent&amp;rsquo;s favor?  Anything is possible with Diggin Deep Boxing.  A full bout takes as little as 20-30 minutes to complete. There is also a quick play option where bouts are decided in one throw of the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
