			<description>Four Suits of War (subtitle: A Swords &amp;amp; Sorcery Card Game) is a game involving a standard deck of playing cards and some six-sided dice.  (The game only includes the rules pamphlet; cards and dice are not included.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, clubs and spades become armies, diamonds become spells, hearts become armor, and face cards are heroes and leaders.  Luck of the draw and luck of the dice play a great part in the outcome of the game, but skill and strategy are an important aspect as well.  A quick game for two or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
