			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...to boldly venture where no gentleman has previously ventured&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the talk of the town in the London coffee houses - how everyone&amp;rsquo;s buying shares in the Company of Gentleman Adventurers Trading into the Moon! In the London docks a ship is being built, designed by Clockwork genius John Wilkins, a ship that can fly. It will be the first vessel ever to leave the shores of Earth and venture to another world - whatever it brings back, the profits are sure to be enormous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Enterprise flaps its mighty wings and ascends into the empyrean, it seems like a perfect example of the superiority of Parliamentarian Clockwork over their Royalist rivals&amp;rsquo; Alchemy. Only the Adventurers, their mission aboard the moon-ship a secret at the highest levels, know that they will not be the first to visit the Moon - their nemesis is ahead of them, and up to no good as usual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the party face ship-board skullduggery, meet wonders between the worlds and face first contact with an ancient civilisation, the race is on to find the secret of the fifth element - Quintessence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quintessence can be played as a stand-alone adventure, but is also the fourth episode in the epic Kingdom &amp;amp; Commonwealth Campaign. Requires the RuneQuest II Core Rulebook from Mongoose Publishing and the Clockwork &amp;amp; Chivalry Core Worldbook from Cubicle 7.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
