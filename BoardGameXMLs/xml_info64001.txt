							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kiraz: The Lost City</name>
									
			<description>From the cover -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Kiraz, the golden city, birthing bed of the Harnic Khuzdul. For seven thousand years Kiraz was the largest and richest city of Harn. The dwarves made her well, and she endured the coming of men, their haste and pestilence, their greed and wars. Until, that is, the tyranny of Lothrim, the Foulspawner. Now gloom hangs like a shroud about Kiraz, sealed with enchantment and good stone. Her dark and cavernous, haunted halls, seem yet to ring with the muted sounds of hammers no hand has touched for six centuries. Even the woods echo with the voices of a hundred ghosts. Now and then, an adventurer grown brave from too much ale, and greedy from tales of treasure, comes to Kiraz. If he is not enslaved or slain by the Equani or gargun, he will try the Gate of Hrazadar, seek other entrances, give up in disgust, and return whence he came - if he is lucky. Ushet The hills surrounding Kiraz are home to numerous bands of ores. There is a major gargun colony at Ushet, a cave-complex just four leagues southeast of the Kiraz. Ushet is inhabited by a hybrid culture of Gargu-Khanu, and their Gargu-Arak and Gargu-Hyeka slaves. The Khanu, also known as black orcs, are the largest, strongest, and most murderous of the five gargun species. The Horns of Ikarus Kiraz is also the scene of the second quest in the epic search for the mysterious, otherworld, arch-mage, Panaga. In the first quest, The Staff of Fanon, players were introduced to Panaga's misdeeds; in this quest they will come to realize that he is their nemesis. Compatible for all rule systems.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
