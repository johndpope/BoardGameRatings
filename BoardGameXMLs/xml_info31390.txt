			<description>Top of the Goalposts is a DTP card game that simulates a soccer game between two generic teams. You play with a 50 cards deck that you have to end for two times (one for each half of the game). Each card is rated for Attack, Defense, Shot and Goal-Save and most of the cards have also a special action on them. Player with the ball must try to move ball from Midfield to Shot area, while the other must try to get the ball back and possibly start a rapid counterattack. There are rules for substitution and several special events.&lt;br/&gt;Easy (Ages 7/8 and up), but fun and very fast and competitive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available for print &amp;amp; play through wargamedownloads.com in English version&lt;br/&gt;Italian version, called &amp;quot;Incrocio dei pali&amp;quot; available for print &amp;amp; play through&lt;br/&gt;arima.it&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
