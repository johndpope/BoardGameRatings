			<description>Do you have the gift of the gab? In the tradition of the great orators, players are challenged to express their opinion on hundreds of issues (many of which are hilarious). Enhances creativity and lateral thinking and ideal for anyone wishing to improve their public speaking skills. 3 to 8 players. Ages 8 to adult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the heart of the game are the 500 &amp;lsquo;Opinion&amp;rsquo; cards. When a player lands on an Opinion Square he or she becomes &amp;lsquo;the Candidate&amp;rsquo;, draws an Opinion Card and reads it to the other players. The Candidate then selects an opponent from amongst the other players who is now called &amp;lsquo;the Opposition&amp;rsquo;. The Candidate argues in favor of the Opinion for up to a minute. Players cannot choose sides - they must argue the Opinion as it stands - whether they agree with the statement or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The opposing player then argues against the opinion. The remaining players vote for the best argument - not for the argument they agree with - but for the best defended position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because the voters are not casting a secret ballot, but have to justify why they think an argument was good or bad, this part of the game can get pretty raucous as players try to convince each other that someone&amp;rsquo;s argument was absolute balderdash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opinions, however, is not just about arguing an opinion. There is a whole story to the game which unfolds as players race for the Presidency. Good and bad press, in the form of the 500 Press Cards, alternatively encourages or plagues players as they seek support for their campaigns. Get arrested in a riot, take a vacation in the Caribbean, rescue a kitten and meet the Queen as your career unfolds (or unwinds!). get caught in compromising situations or rewarded for your service to the community as you work your way to the top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
