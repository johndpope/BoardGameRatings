			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder/3.5 Compatible Adventure for 4-6 PCs of levels 6-8&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes it is the simplest of tasks which end up taking much more of time and energy than they should. When the party is asked by the local sage to collect some rare flora, it feels like relatively easy money; a journey into the woods they&amp;rsquo;ve traveled before, a conversation with someone they&amp;rsquo;ve met before and then on to gather the crop. The characters can hear the Thirsty Serpent tavern calling them after a brisk afternoon&amp;rsquo;s work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the PCs&amp;rsquo; plans go awry when it turns out nothing is quite that straighforward. Deals have to be struck, foes defeated, anger and scorn dealt with and then the whole process gone through again. When there is duplicity at every turn and double-crossing is done with relish, the PCs have to keep their wits and weapons equally sharp. Dealing with someone who is prepared to cross the line between humiliation and harm at a moment&amp;rsquo;s notice is a tough challenge; this quickly becomes about much more than mere mushrooms!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included in &amp;ldquo;Alchemist&amp;rsquo;s Errand&amp;rdquo;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Maps by 3x ENnie Award winning Cartographer Todd Gamble&lt;br/&gt;     New Monster: Tri-Tongued Horror&lt;br/&gt;     7 New Traps&lt;br/&gt;     1 High Resolution Battlemap&lt;br/&gt;     3 Full Screen Cave Maps filled with illustrations&lt;br/&gt;     New Magical Item: Jaamuuri&amp;rsquo;s Amulet of Icy Defense&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
