			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spanish American War is a most interesting &amp;quot;little&amp;quot; war for the miniatures gamer. Machine guns, smokeless powder, barbed wire, dynamite guns, magazine rifles, and all sorts of exciting items first came to the attention of the American public in this war, while war correspondents became public figures as they covered the war in detail.  It is also the war that would cause the formation of the 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry, a most interesting amalgamation of western frontiersmen, Indians, and eastern dudes, all drawn together by the personal magnetism of the former Assistant Secretary of the Navy and future President, one Theodore Roosevelt. It was the war that would serve as the introduction of the United States onto the world stage, and make the 20th Century the &amp;quot;American Century&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume One Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The historical background of the Spanish American War in Cuba and Puerto Rico&lt;br/&gt;    The Cuban Army in historical context&lt;br/&gt;    The Spanish Army in historical context&lt;br/&gt;    The Prewar Regular Army of the U.S.  in historical context&lt;br/&gt;    The Volunteer Army of the U.S. in historical context&lt;br/&gt;    San Juan Heights Scenario &amp;amp; Order of Battle for Volley, Bayonet, &amp;amp; Glory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
