			<description>Players start by populating the pond (board) with stones to block spaces thereby limiting movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once stones are placed, players take turns moving as many of their pieces that they wish within their movement limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are Six kinds of Koi pieces on the field, each one with its own movement limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to capture opposing Koi by &amp;quot;jumping&amp;quot; directly across that piece to an available opposite space. However, there is no limit to how many adjacent Koi pieces you can capture in a single &amp;quot;jump&amp;quot;. However, if a stone or your own piece is in the way, you cannot make a capture. If you make a capture, that piece must stop moving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a piece has finished it's action it &amp;quot;flips&amp;quot; revealing either a lily pad or a lotus flower. These represent the piece has moved, however if you can manage to &amp;quot;jump&amp;quot; a lotus flower that is exposed, you can revive a lost piece in its place (that piece is then allowed to continue moving and capturing to create cascading captures). There is a revive limit of six pieces per player per game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stones on the board stay dormant and block captures or allow Koi to hide behind to avoid or distance their attacks. However, two types of Koi utilize special stone rules. One allows the Koi to move through stones without stopping on them. The other can capture stones and Koi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players with stones in their possession must place exactly one stone down at the very end of their turn. If no stones then the turn ends normally. If a player has more than one stone then only one may be placed).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the board itself is unique because much like many ponds with elevated stone work, the corners all have elevated sections. In these places, Koi may move freely within them, but if a Koi's movement ends in these spaces, it will die at the end of the players turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends in one of several ways. If you capture all of your opponent's Koi, disable your opponents ability to move their Koi, or both players pass then players count the number of capture Koi values with the player having the most points declared as the winner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
