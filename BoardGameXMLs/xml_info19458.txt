							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Indian Arrow-Heads</name>
									
			<description>The game consists of 42 arrow-heads and a score card.  The arrow-heads have a colored triangular head and a different colored tail into which another triangular head can fit.  They also have a picture of an Indian with the name of a tribe (Potawatomi, Kiowa, Sioux, etc.) on the body, but for playing purpose, the tribes are irrelevant.  The score card consists of jutting triangles of different colors and boxed numbers in 5 colors.&lt;br/&gt;The arrow-heads are dealt out to players face down.  Each player in turn places an arrow-head on either the score card or a previously played arrow-head so that the color of the head matches the color of the tail it fits into, thereby creating a box of one color.  Players attempt to optimize their score by finding the match for their arrow-head that results in the largest available score on the score card.  The score is recorded each time an arrow-head is played.  If there is no available match for the player, he forfeits his turn, and must try again with the same arrow-head next turn.&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until all arrow-heads have been played.  The winner has the highest total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
