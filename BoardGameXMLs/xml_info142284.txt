			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BECOME THE SQUAD COMMANDER!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For some, the smell of oil is akin to that of a fine perfume, the rush of invention is the only motivation one needs, and the eternal battle against corrosion is a constant annoyance. These individuals, the tinkers, are exemplars of the unfettered creative spirit. It is this creative spirit, the constant thirst for new ideas, that propels them to seek the unknown, whether it be found in a library or in the dark depths of an ancient tomb.  Supported by a vast array of custom automatons, an experienced tinker, while not a fierce combatant on his own, commands an exceptionally versatile squadron that more than makes up for his own deficiencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presented herein is the tinker's Invention Book, 121 inventions used to customize the tinker's automatons. The intent of this product is to give those currently on the fence a closer glimpse at the tinker itself, while also providing a free reference to those who may pick up future tinker-themed products, but don't want to drop four bucks on the base class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
