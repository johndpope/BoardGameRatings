			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 'AGENT ECHO', players are Spies who wake up behind enemy borders with no memory of their past. Over the span of the mission, the Spies will receive orders from whoever they&amp;rsquo;re working for &amp;ndash; whether through notes they find on themselves, contacts they&amp;rsquo;re instructed to meet, or even telepathic communication &amp;ndash; that will give them just enough information to know where to go next, slowly revealing more about the world, the mission they have to complete, the people they&amp;rsquo;re working for, and themselves. Players start with nothing but three basic skills and a codename, and during the game they will build their character by using flashes of memory from their past life, known as Echoes, to establish new skills. The Game Master (GM) will also periodically feed the players memories, revealing more about the mission and challenging every assumption they&amp;rsquo;ve made so far. During the game, the players will constantly be on the border between the past and the present, torn between the life they see in their memories and the importance of the mission. By the end, the outcome of the mission rests on what choice they make.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
