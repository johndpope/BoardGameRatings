			<description>Cringle Bells is a game about Elves, specifically Santa's Elves. It is a game about these Elves working feverishly during the last 12 hours before Santa's sleigh leaves to deliver toys. Why 12 hours? Because Elves procrastinate. They know that the one who garners the most favor from Santa (points) gets to sit at the Big Man's table for after-Christmas dinner. They know that the one who garners the most favor from Santa is rewarded a 2-month vacation in Hawaii with any other Elf at the North Pole. And the most important thing of all? There's only one girl Elf, Gizelda in the doll wigs department (and she's the only Elf that's been to Hawaii EVERY YEAR!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All you need is a pair of six-sided dice (you're not playing Monopoly that often, are you?), 1 deck of standard playing cards, the game rules, and scoresheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns attempting to complete the assembly of toys that are on the conveyor belt. They receive bonus points for dice combinations, completing a toy that their department specializes in (the same suit as their score sheet), and for completing the toy that their department makes all the time (a specific card).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a family game for 1 or more players and available free as a print and play game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will become the Great Garbanzo and earn the most Favor? Most importantly, who will get to take the beautiful Gizelda to Hawaii?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
