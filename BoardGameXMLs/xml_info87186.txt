							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Imperiale Strategie</name>
									
			<description>A diceless game of strategy set in the Napoleonic era. The game comes with 3 maps: Austerlitz, Borodino and Villodrigo. The players manage one army each (either blue or white). These armies are identical with only the generals being different. The blue army appear to represent France and the white army seems more generic. This game uses a square pattern for the maps. Each square has a strength value depending of the type of terrain represented in it. For example, in squares representing plains, the cavalry unit are strongest, but it is rather different for the cities and wooded terrain types. Each army contains artillery, cavalry, infantry and guard units. The artillery units must be used by infantry or guard units, never alone. The objectives include the destruction of the opponent's army, eliminating the opponent's general or capturing cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
