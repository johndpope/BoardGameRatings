			<description>Insulting at the highest level!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you always wanted to fool the elves, witches, orcs and magicians of their unconstructive mindset? Use your non-existent tact and inexhaustible creativity to verbally humiliate your companions as efficiently as possible. With each new game, new unique combinations of insults are created that you can hand out to your comrades. But beware, because your companions also have some quick-witted insults that they would love to hand over to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is being played by players drafting cards from a common pool, creating their humiliation as a phrase. A grammatically correct sentence, no matter if it makes sense or not, can be used against an opponent to shame him publically, giving him penalty points. Some races are offended and thus humilated more by specific words than others. Once a player has accumulated 30 points or more through insults of the other players, he is eliminated from the game, though there are a couple of proposed house rule which allow for different ways to play this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
