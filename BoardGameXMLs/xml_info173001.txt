			<description>The aim of this game is for children to learn and realize certain rules which should never be forgotten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The role of children in this game is twofold.&lt;br/&gt;They move in the roads, either as a pedestrian or as a driver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As drivers, they must previously obtain a driving licence and they must drive by the right side of the road paying attention to the lights, etc ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As pedestrians, they must not ever forget before leaving the pavement to look to the left, look to the right and walk fast so that they can go safely and quickly home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will answer at least five questions correctly?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will arrive more quickly at an end?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A educative traffic game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
