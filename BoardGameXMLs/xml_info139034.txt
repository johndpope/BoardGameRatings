							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Panzer Corps Grand Campaign &#039;45 West</name>
									
			<description>Now, with the release of Panzer Corps &amp;rsquo;45 West, the Grand Campaign comes to an end. In this final installment, surrounded by enemies on all sides, the once mighty German Wehrmacht faces ultimate defeat on the eve of 1945.  Little do the Allies suspect that deep underground in secret bunkers, German scientists and engineers have built an arsenal of wonder weapons that could turn the tide of the war!  Armed with the these new weapons, Germany sends the last of its reserves in to battle with Operation Wacht am Rhein - a final attempt to end the war favourably.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DLC contains 5 new units including the V1, V2 and advanced jet aircraft such as the Gotha, 18 all-new scenarios that utilizes the new features implemented in Panzer Corps: Afrika Korps as well as the latest content updates. Players can import their core force from the previous campaigns, or alternatively use a preset core force and play each of the campaigns on its own or jump in at any year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
