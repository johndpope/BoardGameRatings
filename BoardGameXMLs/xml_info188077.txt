							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Da Scramble Pidign Crossword Game</name>
									
			<description>Da Scramble Pidgin Crossword Game is a tile-laying word game using the Pidgin language, particularly as spoken in Hawaii. A pile of letter tiles is placed face-down on the table. Each player in turn rolls two six-sided dice, takes that many letters from the pile, and tries to make a Pidgin word or phrase from them. All drawn tiles are kept face-up. If unable to place a word, the player passes his or her turn to the next player who rolls, collects letters and tries to lay down a word. Once a word is laid down, all words must connect in crossword fashion similar to Scrabble. Although tiles may not be moved once played, players may steal tiles from other players to complete words or phrases (but be careful! This can help them). The game ends when all letters have been drawn and either one player plays his or her last letter or no more words can be made by any player. The player with the fewest tiles left wins. The game comes with a small pamphlet-size Pidgin dictionary, but players are encourage to use their knowledge of the language to settle disputes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes packaged in a cardboard tube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
