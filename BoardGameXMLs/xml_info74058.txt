							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quake 4</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Quake 4 is the fourth title in the series of Quake first-person shooter computer games. The game was developed by Raven Software and distributed  by Activision. Raven Software has collaborated with id Software, the creators and historical developers of preceding Quake  games. In this case, id Software supervised the development of the game as well as providing the Doom 3 engine, now referred to as 'id Tech 4', upon which it was built. Quake 4 went gold in early October 2005 and was released on October 18, 2005 for the PC, and later for the Xbox 360  and the Macintosh. A special DVD Collectors Edition also exists, including promotional material and the game Quake II  with its expansions, The Reckoning and Ground Zero. The Xbox 360 version of Quake 4 is based on the Special Collectors Edition, and therefore also includes Quake II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plotwise, the game is a sequel to Quake II and takes place during the same war as Enemy Territory: Quake Wars. Quake II, Quake 4, or Enemy Territory: Quake Wars do not share story lines with Quake or Quake III Arena; their only relation is their names and logos. Compared to other titles in the Quake series, Quake 4 has an increased emphasis on the single-player portion of the game. A multiplayer mode is available, but it does not involve playable bots like Quake III Arena, without 3rd party modifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Xbox 360 version of Quake 4 was released at the launch of the Xbox 360  and is Xbox Live compatible. Due to the fact that Quake 4 needed to be developed in a short time period in order to meet the launch of the Xbox 360, there have been major issues with framerates for the console adaptation, earning it the award for Most Aggravating Frame Rate/Best Slideshow in the GameSpot.com Best and Worst of 2005 list. In addition, the Xbox 360 port of Quake 4 has very long load times and Xbox Live glitches that result in problematic multiplayer experiences, as documented by game review sites as well as on Activision's support pages for the Xbox 360 version. This version was initially priced the same as the PC Special Edition DVD and features the same content. Unlike the PC version, however, as of November 2008 the Xbox 360 version has not received any patches to fix its numerous problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aspyr Media published and released Quake 4 for Mac OS X, on April 5, 2006 as a universal binary, compatible with both PowerPC- and x86-based Macs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;id Software continued its tradition of supporting Linux by releasing a Linux version of the Quake 4 binary executable. The game can be downloaded for free from id's servers, though it requires a licensed copy of Quake 4 for Windows or Mac in order to run. The Linux installer was made available two days after the release of the game itself.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Quake_4,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
