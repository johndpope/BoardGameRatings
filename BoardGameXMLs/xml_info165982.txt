The Fw 190 had speed and high altitude performance as its two great assets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Features of the DCS: Fw 190 D-9 Dora:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unmatched flight physics that allow you to truly feel what it's like to fly this legend.&lt;br/&gt;    Highly detailed, six-degrees-of-freedom (6 DOF) cockpit.&lt;br/&gt;    Interact with cockpit controls with your mouse.&lt;br/&gt;    Accurate Fw 190 D-9 model, squadron markings, and weapons.&lt;br/&gt;    Detailed modelling the Fw 190 D-9 instruments, weapons, engine, radios, fuel, and electrical systems.&lt;br/&gt;    Battle the P-51D Mustang in single and multiplayer games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
