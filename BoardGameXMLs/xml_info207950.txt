							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">White Moon Cove (5E)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;White Moon Cove is a respectable fishing town located in a cove which acts as an excellent, natural harbour. The inhabitants of this tightly-knit community are sober, hardworking and amiable fishermen, traders and other sturdy folk making their living from the sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite being a fairly peaceful and law-abiding place, White Moon Cove still hold many opportunities for adventure, from rumours of secret smuggler activity to an ancient and possibly haunted lighthouse. Yet, perhaps the most famous reason for White Moon Cove's notoriety is the mysterious underwater edifice known as the Sunken Pyramid which lies hidden far beneath the waves a few miles out to sea. The handful of sages and scholars possessing any knowledge of this massive stone structure debate whether it is a completely natural rock formation, a natural site that has somehow been intentionally modified, or something built long ago by human, or inhuman, hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
