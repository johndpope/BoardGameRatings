			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the Stellar Year 4,576.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The future&amp;rsquo;s a dirty, all-analogue place. Technology got more advanced, but the culture and politics of this f*&amp;amp;^edup future still stinks like 1976. The galaxy's equal parts grunge and glam, polyester and leather. It&amp;rsquo;s a place where billowing Afros never went out of style, where the heroes spark up joints the size of a baby's forearm and blast off for the Frontier. It's a galaxy of stoner nomads cruising the galactic backwaters at FTL speed, banging cute alien spacers with only a cheap-ass Dr. Youp&amp;rsquo;s Condom to protect them. It's a place where the smuggler always shoots first, and the Cosmic Televangelists of the Imperial Church of the Galaxy are always tryin' to get their cut.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a Heavy Future, where futurism takes a back seat to pulpy, retro-futuristic, blasphemous kick-ass adventuring. That's all you really need to know. We'll make up the rest as we go along.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faiths of the Heavy Future&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve said before that Heavy Future's all about blasphemous, kick-ass adventuring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what's that mean?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What kind of gods and things do the people of the year 4,576 worship anyway? What&amp;rsquo;s up with the Imperial Church of the Galaxy? Who do the Cosmic Satanists pray to?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find out in Heavy Gods! This short sourcebook details all the major religions popular in the Heavy Future, as well as a couple new archetypes for the Cleric class suitable to the world, and a few new clerical domains and bunch of new subdomains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
