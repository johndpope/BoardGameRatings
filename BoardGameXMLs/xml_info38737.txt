			<description>Congratulations! As the new franchise owner of a Henchman Unlimited agency, you provide the needed help for many of the world&amp;rsquo;s most discriminating major villains as they implement their evil plans. Survivors often claim that the experience is quite rewarding! But beware those doomsday plans&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have to complete missions set by the major villains. The first player picks the plan the villain wants accomplished, and then the players play henchmen to try to complete the mission. They commit henchman to resolve the evil plan. Players take one henchman card from their hand and commit it face down. These henchmen form the mission pool. &lt;br/&gt;All Players Simultaneously Reveal Henchmen in the Mission Pool. All the better to determine which henchmen to undermine &amp;hellip; er &amp;hellip; help&amp;hellip; during subterfuge. Players Play Subterfuge Cards. These cards can help and hinder in the efforts. Then you see whether the plan worked. If the plan succeeded, then the highest unique number on the henchmen will count for points (be promoted to the back office). &lt;br/&gt;You repeat till 3 rounds or a doomsday plan has been completed. If a doomsday plan was enacted, then the player whose henchman made it succeed is ineligible for victory.&lt;br/&gt;Each eligible player totals up the henchman value for all henchmen promoted to the back office. The player with the highest total is the winner. Players may tie for victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available from: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.vbasementgames.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.vbasementgames.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have to create an account to download the game.&lt;br/&gt;2014-05-23 update: The website vbasementgames.com no longer available&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
