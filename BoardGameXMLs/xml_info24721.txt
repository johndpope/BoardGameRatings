			<description>Another game of the 4 square cardboard games from Scandecor (Play Racing, Play Olympic, Play Western, Play Pirates).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A railroad track crosses the longish board and a small train drives from left to right (and back if a longer play is wanted) with gold barrels in his wagon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 2 desperadoes who must try to steal these gold barrels and bring them in his hideout. A turn consists of a roll of 2 dice, where one must be used for the movement of the train. Since the train must stop at all 5 stations spread around the board, it moves slow enough, that desperadoes of several players will meet it quite often and they can try to kill each other and take the gold barrel in this way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with all games of the series, the board is illustrated with funny comics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
