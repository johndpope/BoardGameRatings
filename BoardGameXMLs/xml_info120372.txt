							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Forgotten Archetypes 1: The Gunslinger</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experienced D20 System author Patrick Younts introduces The Gunslinger, a 20-page PDF. The duelist, the greedy highwayman, the sniper whose deadly touch can bring down a victim from miles away, all these are examples of the gunslinger. Though some choose to romanticize the gunslinger's trade, and though some gunslingers act as champions of the people, using their guns in the defense of the helpless, in truth the gunslinger is nothing more and nothing less than a lightning fast, cold blooded killer, an artist of death who can look his opponents in the eye and snuff their life without blinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
