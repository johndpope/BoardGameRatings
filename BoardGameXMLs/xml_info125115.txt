							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ice Merchant</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the summer days grow longer and the temperature rises it is time to reach for a nice cool drink to make things more comfortable, before freezers and refrigeration this meant buying ice from an ice house. Ice-houses stored that had been cut from ponds during the winter or shipped from colder climates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s Toys for the Sandbox tells the story of Marcus, a former hireling turned merchant. This time out there was only room for 3 NPCs but one of them is a dragon with a score to settle. There is of course the map and flavor text describing the business and a whole bunch of hooks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is ecological devastation, forbidden love and a business rivalry that might be more than it seems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
