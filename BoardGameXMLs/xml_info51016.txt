			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Has this ever happened to you? You are flying over metropolis when suddenly your super hearing picks up five different distress calls from all over the world. All are urgent, all deal with the lives of thousands of people, but which one will you pick?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find out in this exciting adventure that pushes Superman to the limits of his endurance. Can he keep the Earth from falling apart, discover the fiendish plot behind it all, use his super-computer in the Fortress of Solitude to find a solution, and still make his 6:00 newscast as Clark Kent? Only those brave enough to play this adventure will know what it's really like to be the Man of Steel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
