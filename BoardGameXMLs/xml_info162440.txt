			<description>Roll the dice. Play the Perfect Show. Avoid tomatoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encore is a Rock'n-Rollers dice game for one-to-four players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Each turn is a Performance. Each Act (player) rolls the dice to be the first to complete the necessary Show requirements and Perform an Encore, or be the Last Act Standing. Fail to score during a Performance, collect a tomato and face the feared Technical Difficulties! Too many Technical Difficulties and you'll Bomb the Show! Too many tomatoes and you'll lose the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Each Act (player) takes a score card. There are various Show requirements in three stages of the game: General Admission, Backstage, and Gig Time. Acts must Perform these Show requirements by rolling the dice. All Show requirements must be completed before moving on to the next stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Each turn is a Performance. On a Performance, an Act will roll six of the custom Performance dice. Set aside any 'keepers'. You can end your Performance to score at any time. To re-roll, a die must be discarded from the remaining dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Show requirements are checked off the scorecard when they are completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- If an Act fails to Perform a Show requirement by the end of their Performance, they must collect a tomato and roll the Technical Difficulties die. After four Technical Difficulties, the Act will get two tomatoes thrown at them &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; miss their next Performance (lose a turn)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- To win, an Act must be the first to Perform an Encore, or become the Last Act Standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
