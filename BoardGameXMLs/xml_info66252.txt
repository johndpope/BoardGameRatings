							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Camp Fire Girls Game</name>
									
			<description>The object of this game is to try and enter the &amp;quot;Council Fire&amp;quot; while collecting as many 'Honor Beads' as possible while on the way around the board. The player capturing the most points in Honors wins the game. One unusual part of this game is that players all play at the same time. There are no turns in the game, so no waiting for your turn before you play. The winner is the player who captures the most Honors, not neccesarily the person who finishes the game first. You must get to the &amp;quot;Log Cabin Council Fire&amp;quot; by exact count in order to end the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
