			<description>(Line One) - Not to be confused with Stefan Dorra&amp;rsquo;s Linie 1, or Streetcar (Goldsieber).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was published as a promotional game by the &amp;quot;Aachener Stra&amp;szlig;enbahn und Energieversorgungs-AG&amp;quot; - the category &amp;quot;trains&amp;quot; is misleading, as the game circles around bus lines (the streetcar era is long gone in Aachen/Aix-la-Chapelle).&lt;br/&gt;The players have to acquire bus lines in the first phase, in the second phase all players have to ride these lines (no dice are involved here).&lt;br/&gt;Own lines are free, to use those of other players one has to pay a fare.&lt;br/&gt;The richest player wins after a predefined duration or after all target cards have been played (which can last several hours).&lt;br/&gt;Though the game is more fun and challenging than one should expect from this description its (many) components are detracting: Most cards are set with a typewriter, to get eight different playing pieces seven yellow wooden buses were lacquered in other colors - the buses itself are a little too big to use them in a reasonable way on the board, small representations of the board (for each player) are almost unusable due to low resolution.&lt;br/&gt;Nice touch: small cardboard trays help to keep the components separated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
