							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Color of Freedom</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the best racers from all across the Empire have been invited to Rome for the last, and most prestigious, race of the season. This year, the Blues of Alexandria are amongst those who have been invited. Their fame has grown much this past season, and now it has brought them to Rome. The fame, favor, and fortune that can be won here in Rome is far and away above any other race anywhere in the Empire. Win here, and the brass ring (and the freedom that goes with it) may be yours. ...But of course, every other racer there has the exact same notion, and will do anything to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
