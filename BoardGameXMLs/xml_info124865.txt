			<description>Similar to Blackjack&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to win as many gold pieces as possible. To win the gold pieces in play, You must reach 21 or get close but not to exceed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 54 cards and 10 pieces of gold. Each card has a value  2 to 10 and flag cards selectable value 1 or 11.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets 2 cards.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to reach or come as close as possible to 21, everyone will, each in turn, decide to stop or request an additional card, but must be careful not to exceed 21!&lt;br/&gt;When all players have stopped, everyone turns over his cards and comparing results. The player with 21 or that the closest wins the gold coin. The player with over 21 lose one gold this round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If 2 or more players have tied having 21 they each won a gold coin taken from the treasure, unless a player has two cards with only 21, he has a &amp;quot;Blackjack&amp;quot; and then won 2 pieces of gold.&lt;br/&gt;If 2 or more player have tied having less than 21, nobody takes the gold but one more gold piece are taken into play for the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who has won the most gold coins when the treasure is empty or there are no more cards in the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
