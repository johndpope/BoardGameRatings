							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Battle for Hill 218</name>
									
			<description>Hill 218 looks just like any other hill on your map, but High Command says it's important and it's your job to take it. Unfortunately the enemy has the same plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Battle for Hill 218 is an abstract strategy card game for two players where you represent a military commander struggling for control of Hill 218 as part of a larger military struggle. Players must maintain supply lines and destroy enemy units to advance on the enemy home base, while ensuring that their own base is not taken. It's easy to learn and quick to play but has a depth of strategy usually found only in games that takes much longer to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Deploy different army units such as Infantry, Tanks and Special Forces&lt;br/&gt;     Play vs. the computer with two difficulty levels&lt;br/&gt;     Online play through Game Center or play a local friend over wi-fi&lt;br/&gt;     Game Center Achievements and Online Leaderboards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the popular card game with the same name, The Battle for Hill 218 has been described as the perfect strategy card game and is now finally available for the iPad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
