			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern Day Gladiators - the Wrestling Game, released in June of 2012, continues the story within the SECOND of 4 promised expansions to the world containing:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        2 Full color, fully illustrated wrestlers to use in your fed - The first submitted character makes his debut. And a character initially illustrated in the basic set finally gets his chance.&lt;br/&gt;        A full storyline, taking place within the backdrop of a major wrestling show (call it a pay-per-view) as the Circuit has put away the politics (or has it?) and its full steam ahead. Into what, no one is quite certain.&lt;br/&gt;        3 new, completely unique wrestling match types - Gentleman's Duel, Triple Triad, and the monstrous Blind Faith Cage match.&lt;br/&gt;        And some rules clarification in regard to Disqualification moves. Now, those who cheat have a valid reason for doing so (beyond the obvious).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern Day Gladiators... the best wrestling imaginable!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
