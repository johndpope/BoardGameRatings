							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ruins</name>
									
			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While it has been rumored for many years that the centaurs were one of the earliest inhabitants of the area around Mor Aldenn, there has never been any definitive evidence presented to give this legend any credence. In the Ossindrillon forest just west of the road to Ossindil, such evidence awaits discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elven settlements are known to have existed in the forests and marshland around Mor Aldenn for centuries before the founding. Every so often rumors arise of the lost traveler who stumbled upon some great monument or ruined structure from a previous age in the wilds outside of the city. Many an adventurer has begun their career searching for these ruins with visions of long-abandoned treasures just waiting to be plundered in their heads. Unfortunately the reality is that most of the stories turn out to be completely unsubstantiated or, at best, a huge disappointment when all that is found is a few toppled standing stones where one had envisioned discovering long lost temples full of hidden riches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
