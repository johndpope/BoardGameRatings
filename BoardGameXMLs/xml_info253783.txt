			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Living is hard, now that society has fallen. We used to complain that our lives were boring. These days, every moment is a struggle. Every meal is earned. Every breath is precious. Dangers roam the landscape, both human and worse. Few survive, and numbers dwindle. Those who manage to live long are legend, hardened heroes or monstrous villains. You are among them.&lt;br/&gt;Your canteen, your weapon, your food: these are the most precious treasures in the world. But once you reach our level you might start wanting more, the whispered wonders yet to be uncovered. Secrets of old ready to come back into the harsh light of this fallen world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you plumb those depths and scour the wastelands for what we&amp;rsquo;ve lost? Will you band together with fellow survivors, watching each other&amp;rsquo;s backs in the treacherous night? Will you lend a blistered hand to rebuilding society in this hell of a world? Or will you break what is left of it, and remake it anew?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HELLSCAPES is a rules and genre [adaptation] that allows you and your friends to set out into the post-apocalyptic wastes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
