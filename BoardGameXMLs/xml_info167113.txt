			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations on your new position at the Agency. You were chosen from a pool of highly qualified, world (and time) renowned applicants to join the most advanced Time maintenance and Protection Agency in the known timeline. With seemingly endless streams of resources and funding provided by NATO we are equipped to not only preserve the rich beauty of all of human history, but also protect it from chrono-terrorists and other nefarious entities bent on wreaking havoc throughout the ages. The work you will be doing with us is invaluable, and we here at the Agency make it our priority to ensure the safety and comfort of our workers. Oh! And don't worry, we just located the last bloke who held your position back in the Cretaceous period, so we have a perfect track record of employee survival; after a few years of rehabilitation he'll be right as rain! Chin up! There's work to do!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
