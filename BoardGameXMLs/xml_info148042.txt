							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fast Food Diner</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 48 x 50 inch Floor Plan of a Fast Food Diner, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play. The map suits Modern rpg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be cut down so that you can have just a 32 x 30 inch floorplan of just the Diner without the car park or print whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fast Food Diner module includes the eating area, cooking area, and bathrooms inside the diner as well as a parking lot and drive thru outside, in the British style layout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fast food diner can be used in games ranging from the 1920s to the modern area. The 1920s is the start point since this is the first era of mass-produced cars following Ford&amp;rsquo;s line assembly model and after the establishment of the first fast food diners in 1910s that became more successful in the roaring 20s. As such, the fast food diner is useful in scenarios ranging from film noir to modern games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventures with the fast food diner can start with a robbery attempt that could devolve into a hostage situation with criminals holed up inside the restaurant. The Player Characters could be superheroes that are called in to save the day. But the robbers are merely thug henchmen of a super villain, who has waited for the superheroes to arrive to strike. The parking lot outside could become a battlefield with a brutish super villain throwing cars or a smart super villain in a power suit shooting ray guns at the superheroes. The superheroes have to use the cars for cover to get close enough to the super villain to power down the suit or engage the brute in melee and knock him out. The complication is the number of civilians in the fast food diner as well as the police cordon around the area. The super villain may get desperate and start targeting the police or the civilians, especially if the Player Characters have shown a propensity for heroic saves of innocent bystanders in the past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fast food diner also makes an excellent spot for the Player Characters to unwind following a hectic and dangerous scenario and could easily be their local hangout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
