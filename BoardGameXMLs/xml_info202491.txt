			<description>--Introduction--&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 12 Towers is an RPG board game for 2-6 players. The objective is to take control of all. Active Towers, and/or eliminate the opposing players. &lt;br/&gt;Players take the role of &amp;ldquo;Keepers&amp;rdquo;, powerful rulers that control a Tower, and its surrounding territory. Throughout the course of the game, Towers will be &lt;br/&gt;gained, lost, or even destroyed. Controlling Towers will involve combat, diplomacy, and teamwork. However, it may also involve treachery and deception.&lt;br/&gt;                 &lt;br/&gt;            While the objectives of the game are clear, it is entirely up to the players to decide how they play the game individually. Some may be aggressive &lt;br/&gt;and charge head on, while others might focus on defensive actions. In the end, when players interact, they are in complete control of their own fate. &lt;br/&gt;Not only do you bring a strategy to the game, you bring your personality as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--Brief Overview of the game--&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2-6&lt;br/&gt;Game Type: PvP, RPG, Exploration, Board Control&lt;br/&gt;Game Board: 32 x 32 Inch Dodecahedron (13 pieces)&lt;br/&gt;Movement Style: Set space amount (Can be increased or decreased)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Components:&lt;br/&gt; - 12 Keeper Figurines&lt;br/&gt; - 12 Tower Figurines&lt;br/&gt; - 12 Colored Die&lt;br/&gt; - 576 Game Cards&lt;br/&gt; - 6 Tracker Sheets&lt;br/&gt; - 12 5x7 Tower Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Run Time:&lt;br/&gt; Easy/2 Players - 30/60 Minutes&lt;br/&gt; Medium/4 to 6 Players - 45/90 Minutes&lt;br/&gt; Hard/8 to 12 Players - 120/180 Minutes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--Game Board--&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board for The 12 Towers uses a hexagon battle grid.

Whether you&amp;rsquo;re the Brutal Orc King of the Fire Tower, or the &lt;br/&gt;Undead Lord of the Black Tower, your Keeper is the King of it&amp;rsquo;s territory. As you play the game, you&amp;rsquo;ll gain control, or lose Towers. &lt;br/&gt;Be sure to use strategy and planning when you take over the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--Power--&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power is the heart of The 12 Towers. Power is a simplified number that represents everything that you are; Health, Mana, Currency, Influence, everything. &lt;br/&gt;Almost everything in the game effects Power. Whether you are taking damage from weapons, or casting spells. All players begin the game with the same amount of Power. &lt;br/&gt;The standard starting amount is 2000. This number is them divided between your Keeper, and your starting Tower. &lt;br/&gt;This number can be adjusted to use needs, or accommodate additional players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--Cards--&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt; The core version of The 12 Towers contains 576 cards.
