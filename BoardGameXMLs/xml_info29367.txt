							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cossack Revenge: Denikin&#039;s Abyss, 1920</name>
									
			<description>Cossack Revenge depicts the tragic end-point of the White Army's battle against the Bolsheviks. In March 1920, as the White Army retreated to their last escape route, the British, which had supported them with material since 1918, finally committed a battalion of troops to secure the port. At sea, several battleships and the first aircraft carrier provided cover. On shore, the fighting was desperate using all available resources including tanks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game depicts the situation from March 20th to 27th, when the last evacuees left and the Reds stormed into the city. In the game, the Whites must carefully evacuate their troops. Failure will end the White Army cause prematurely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale: The map scale is about 1 mile per hex. Each combat unit represents roughly a battalion in size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
