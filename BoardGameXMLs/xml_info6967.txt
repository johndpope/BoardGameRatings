			<description>There's a cat stranded in a tree, a traffic jam at the intersection, a small fire in a neighbor's house!  There are so many things to do and learn in this board game designed especially for young players! Travel around the neighborhood in your car, helping out wherever you can. As you do, you collect the parts you need to complete your own Badge of Honor and win the game. Great job! Take the badges apart and you're ready to play again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
