							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Martial Power: Rogue Power Cards</name>
									
			<description>Player's using Martial Power Cards don't need to crack open a rulebook every time they swing a sword all the crucial information is right in front of their eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each and every class power appearing in the Martial Power sourcebook has its own card. Simply select the cards for your character's powers and you're ready to play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each deck of 100 cards includes all the powers from Martial Power for one of the four classes featured in the book fighter, ranger, rogue, and warlord plus a few blank cards for players to use for other powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
