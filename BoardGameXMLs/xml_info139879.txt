			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robots for Everyone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the world of 2017, technology makes the world go around. Computers are ubiquitous, robots are becoming common place, and even biotechnology is in every home and school. The infrastructure that keeps mankind waking up in the morning, going to work, eating, sleeping, and living is composed of a thousand thousand technological processes, each of which is networked into all of the others to make life run smoothly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From time to time, small glitches in this massive system pop up. These are annoyances in the day of the common person ,making them miss a meal, be late for work, or slows down the busy pace of their frenetic life. The system self-corrects, for the most part, and these glitches are either corrected, or adapted to. Life goes on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the rare circumstance that the system experiences a major malfunction, there is Hell to pay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;#5: Mass-Produced MAYHEM&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gander Robotics Corporation has finally made humanoid robots available to the public!  Their super-strong, super-durable robots are agile, smart, and all three models are super-useful!  There are over six thousand of them out in the world right now, making life easier for thousands of people in every walk of life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They probably should have given credit to the software engineer, though; because those super-strong, super-durable, super-agile robots are about to have their three laws turned upside-down, and there's going to be a super-mess of super-murder!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can someone stand up to these mechanical serial killers?  Someone had better... one of these robots can do the work of hundreds of people, and there are over six thousand of them out there, trying to duplicate (or exceed!) the most depraved acts of violence in history...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
