			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Friday the 13th is a NES game loosely based on the horror film of the same name from Paramount. In this game you play as a group of camp counselors attempting to save the children (and yourselves) of Camp Crystal from Jason Vorhees by killing him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features an in screen map showing the locations of all of the cabins, unfortunately left and right on the game screens do not directly correspond to directions on the map. Periodically Jason will attack a cabin (an alarm will sound) and and the gamer has a time limit to get a counselor there (you can switch between counselor's freely if they are not being attacked) and fend him off. If you are too late, Jason will start killing children or a counselor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides avoiding/killing random enemies and dealing with Jason encounters (he will attack you at random on almost all game screens) the player will light fireplaces throughout the camp to increase weapon and item drops. Inside of cabins the game switches from its 2D scrolling view to a primitive 3D view. The game takes place over the course of 3 days. Jason becomes more powerful over the course of the game, but certain in game rewards also increase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When encountering Jason he will run away after being damaged a certain amount unless his health is low in which case it is a battle to the death!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notes: Jason wears a bright violet track suit. If you lose the game you are treated to the following message:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You and your friends are dead. GAME OVER&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;making this one of the few NoA releases to mention death or dying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
