							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cities: Skylines â€“ Snowfall</name>
									
			<description>In Snowfall, the difficulty heats up when the city cools down, thanks to a new in-game temperature reading that will have residents bundling up for warmth when the weather outside is frightful. Cosmetic weather, composed of rain and fog, will be added to Cities: Skylines as part of a free update, along with other features to be announced soon. &lt;br/&gt;Players who own Snowfall will get to face new challenges such as ensuring that their city infrastructure can handle seasonal heating demands &amp;ndash; and, when the snow starts falling, that the roads can stay clear. New snowplow services will be required to prevent traffic from freezing in place, while new all-weather trams and expanded public transit options can help residents and visitors alike get around town &amp;ndash; and visit the new winter parks and landmarks available in Snowfall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now is the Winter of This Content: Rain and fog for existing maps, plus a new &amp;ldquo;Winter&amp;rdquo; map theme with snow and all of its challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Streetcars You Desire: Expanded public transportation options, including easier management of existing lines &amp;ndash; and Trams, a new system demanded by fans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;World Warmth, Too: Cold weather increases demands for electricity, unless new water-based heat systems are in place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plowers to the People: Build a snowplow depot to keep traffic flowing during winter weather, and employ new road maintenance systems to keep your streets in shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Chirps: #yeahthereare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
