			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paths of Shadow for Shadow of the Demon Lord&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grizzled veterans of countless campaigns, brutish barbarians spilling out from the hinterlands, peerless champions fighting for a noble cause, or hard-bitten mercenaries who have seen it all: these character concepts describe just a few of the possible types of warriors one might find in Shadow of the Demon Lord games. Although warriors might have many different expressions and stories, they all are exceptionally capable with arms and armor in battle. As their experience grows, so do their durability and dependability. At the outset, warriors distinguish themselves by the weapons they wield and armor they wear, but not until they move onto other paths do they truly come into their own. Until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bred for Battle builds on the warrior novice path presented in the main rulebook by providing new customization options for combat-focused characters. These options offer more variety in technique, reflecting the nature of a warrior&amp;rsquo;s training and providing inspiration for future development. As with all Paths of Shadow installments, everything in Bred for Battle is optional, so check with your Game Master before putting these ideas to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
