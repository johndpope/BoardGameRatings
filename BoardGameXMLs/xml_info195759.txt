							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">New Fighter Maneuvers &amp; Talents</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Become a Terror on the Battlefield!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overwhelming focus on melee. Lack of out of combat options. Emphasis on mundane brute fighting without much versatility in style and feel. The Fighter class is a worthwhile option, but as one of the martial classes it doesn't have the diversity of the more complicated roles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Fighter Maneuvers &amp;amp; Talents is the remedy to these problems! Six new martial schools of related abilities are geared around unique fighting styles to lend a flair of coolness and versatility to every battle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Become a daredevil scoundrel with Glimmering Cloak! Climb sheer surfaces in style with the Parkour talent, get your allies out of harm's way with Swinging Rescue, and other moves which would make the Three Musketeers weep with joy!&lt;br/&gt;    Take up the path of the archer with Heaven's Eye. Use the very elements as a weapon with Neither Sleet Nor Storm, and instill fear in foes as you Darken the Sky with Arrows!&lt;br/&gt;    Harness your ki energy with Iron Hand, manipulate the forces of pain and entropy with Sanguineous Rack, become a living juggernaut with Reaper's Field, and summon the spirits of the dead to join you in battle with Second Soul!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;15 New Talents! 55 New Maneuvers! This is the perfect gift for the party Fighter for your 13th Age games! Even better, the book is watermark-free, so go on and share it with your gaming circle if your adventing party happens to contain a Fighter or two!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
