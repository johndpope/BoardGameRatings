			<description>An abstract strategy game from designer Joli Kansil. Players roll two dodeca, 12-sided dice colored with 3 different spots, to determine how they may place a piece on the 10&amp;times;10 board. Players can play only on their own color, but the dice roll determines how many friendly or enemy pieces the new piece may be adjacent to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to form 5 quinx. A quinx is an arrangement of 5 pieces in an X shape, as found on the 5 of a standard-pipped six-sided die. This shape is sometimes known as a quincunx, from which the game gets its name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dice thrown by each player are the same as found in Kansil's game Krakatoa. Each player has a pair in their color, and each die has 3 yellow, 4 red, and 5 blue spots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Out of print for many years, this is reportedly the hardest Joli Kansil/Xanadu Leisure game to find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
