			<description>From the Back of the Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just when you thought you'd seen it all, we here at Adventure International introduces a program that is sure to blow your conceptions away, pronto! Armored Patrol is a 3-D arcade-style game that's a definite heavyweight in the action department! Your mission is to find and destroy enemy craft in your area with your tank's high-energy plasma weapon. Your perspective is from the inside of a powerful T-36 tank looking out across a city landscape where the enemy lies waiting. Complete with killer robots and laser weaponry, Armored Patrol is packed with lots of extras, including running score tally, sound and high score display. Bit the most impressive feature of Armored Patrol is the incredible graphics which create the total illusion of movement and dimension, and, Armored Patrol accommodates 1 or 2 players so you can share the action with a friend!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
