			<description>This is a childrens memory/matching game with a Sesame Street theme. Each player takes one of the 4 game boards - a Post Office, Fire station, Police Station, or Construction Site. Each board has 4 spaces depicting items you'd find at that location. The 18 picture disks are then shuffled and placed face down in the center of the table. On your turn, you draw a disk and try to match it by color and object to one of your gameboard pictures. If it does match, place it on your board. If it doesn't match, return it to the center area. If you draw a Dump Truck disk, you must return one of the disks on your board to the center area. The first player to match all 4 gameboard pictures with disks wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
