							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bolt Action: Assault on Normandy</name>
									
			<description>Boltâ€ˆAction: Assault on Normandy brings to you everything you need to pit your tactics and wits against your opponent as you recreate the great battles of World War II on the tabletop! In addition to the glorious Bolt Action rulebook and eight Orders Dice, you will find forty hard plastic, multi-pose 28mm miniatures as well as terrain for them to fight over. This is a great starting point as you seek to defeat your foes and bring an end to the greatest conflict in history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This introductory boxed set includes miniatures from two factions &amp;ndash; German and Americans &amp;ndash; allowing two players to learn the basic rules of the game. Using miniature soldiers, tanks and terrain, you can fight battles in the shattered towns of occupied France, either liberating or holding the position according your faction. By moving miniatures that represent troops and vehicles (like Sherman tanks or half trucks) along a scenery-filled tabletop and using dice to resolve shooting or attacking actions as well as leadership tests, you attempt to finish the enemy army or achieve certain objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
