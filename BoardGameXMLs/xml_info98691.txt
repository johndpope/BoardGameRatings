			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scholars of Rhun have labored for centuries to compile the list of known Runes used across the world. The thirty-six known effect Runes and three control Runes have been used in countless skirmishes, and continue to power Rune Stryders to this day. For most, these known Runes have always been sufficient for any magical need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But not everyone is satisfied with the accumulated knowledge. Rune hunters scour the planet, searching for the one new Rune that could give them incredible power or unimaginable wealth. For those who seek to dominate their fellow men, or who simply seek a life of excess, the promise of undiscovered Runes is a powerful lure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using This Book&lt;br/&gt;This book is divided into four sections. The first section is entitled New Runes, and details just that - six new effect Runes and two new control Runes, complete with spell descriptions. The second section, Advanced Runewords, expands upon the Runeword possibilities in the core book by presenting a larger group of advanced Runewords for your exceptionally skilled Runecasters. The third section, Runic Artifacts, provides a variety of Runed items to challenge or reward your players. The final chapter, Finding Runes, provides the gamemaster with several new ideas for working these Runes into a campaign, as well as a few adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
