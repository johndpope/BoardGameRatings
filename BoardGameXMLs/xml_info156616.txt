			<description>In CastleMiner Z, players have to mine for their own resources instead of starting with them. Players can also craft weapons such as a shotgun or assault rifle. Another change from the original game is the addition of enemies including zombies, dragons, and demons. Online modes accommodate 2 to 8 player cooperative gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CastleMiner Z introduces &amp;quot;Awards&amp;quot;, which are awarded for doing different things such as playing online for a certain number of hours, traveling at least a certain distance, crafting various items, and killing several zombies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;CastleMiner&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
