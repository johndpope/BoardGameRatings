			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the first book of D100 Discoveries Series, a great collection of encounter tables offered to you by Zodiac Gods Publishing. If, like us, you are a huge fan of random encounter tables that cover a vast array of environments, sites, and possibilities all at once, this book is for you. Inside this first compilation you will find no less than 600 entries that will in turn amaze, challenge, and perhaps even dumbfound your PCs; you will discover places where the common events from day to day life may hide a deeper meaning, perhaps even led the unwary into a trap, or simply entertain the players for a moment before the next d100 throw. Next time it might be a dangerous encounter, an inevitable disaster, or else just a rumor either about a close or distant place, or one that concerns a famous (or infamous!) personage; fabrication or fact, the final decision is yours to make!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the tables that compose this book are generic enough so as to be compatible with any system with a medieval flavor. DMs and GMs alike will find here plenty of ideas to describe a place briefly or in detail, an array of foes to help determine the combatants of the next engagement, and enough material to establish the bases of an entire quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A single line can be the spark that will ignite your imagination; the combination of many entries put together- randomly or on purpose- the fire that will help you forge a complete series of adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The time has come; turn the page now, and immerse you totally in the universe of D100 Discoveries Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jarrod Camir&amp;eacute;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
