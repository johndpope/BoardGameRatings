							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War and XPs</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The battle lines have been clearly drawn. Which is more than we can say for the heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Order of the Stick: War and XPs tells an epic two-dimensional tale of comedy and adventure as the now-moderately-competent members of everyone's favorite adventuring party, the Order of the Stick, find themselves on the front line of a battle to decide the fate of a bunch of people who aren't them. Join Roy, Elan, Belkar, Haley, Vaarsuvius, Durkon, and thousands of unnamed soldiers as they contend with cryptic prophecies, vengeance, true love, betrayal, and potato salad! And then the big battle happens, and that's really cool, because a whole lot of stuff blows up. This third volume in the Order of the Stick story packs more action-packed stick figure laughs into a half-inch thick, two pound behemoth of a comic book than previously thought possible by scientists who study these things. Incidentally, such scientists are unlikely to get their funding renewed anytime soon. Are you really going to render their final research project meaningless by not buying this book? Do you hate progress??&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
