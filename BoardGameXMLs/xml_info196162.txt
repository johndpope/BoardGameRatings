			<description>Well, it was bound to happen sooner or later; and now the zombie apocalypse is here. But never fear humanity, heroes have emerged to save us all! Ninjas, robots, pirates, monkeys, and aliens are here to defeat the zombie hordes and restore order. All they need is a little bit of your help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie Farkle is a press-your-luck dice rolling game that is fun for the entire family. Each game consist of 6 custom etched and color filled dice in a custom printed dice bag so you can take it with you anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to destroy as many zombies as possible by rolling combinations of dice. You can score the points you earn, or push your luck further for a greater payout. But remember, if you get too reckless, the zombies will eat your brains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
