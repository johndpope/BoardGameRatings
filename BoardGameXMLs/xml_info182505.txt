							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Carapace</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Near mindless engine of destruction, Carapace's name strikes fear in the hearts of entire teams when forced to confront him. Do your heroes have what it takes to stop this juggernaut? Or will they, too, fall broken at his feet like so many noble stalwarts before them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carapace is a PL 14 threat to add to your Mutants &amp;amp; Masterminds campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ALGERNON Files Deluxe Edition is a treasure trove of enemies, allies, locations, and items of power to add to any ongoing M&amp;amp;M game. The series updates the fan-favorite ALGERNON Files material to the 3rd edition of the game and expands it, adding many new and exciting characters to meet and places to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The series is presented as files being transferred (and commented on) from the databases of the AI known as ALGERNON (who supports The Sentinels' superteam) to the possession of The Challenger Institute for curation. Each entry contains a character or other material of note ready to be dropped into a broad variety of adventures and settings with little or no work on the part of enterprising Gamemasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
