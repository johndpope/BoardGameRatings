			<description>Zombified is a 4-10 player elimination game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let's face it, there's no good explanation. You and your friends are locked in a silo with a broken jar of Zombie-Maker-243. The end result is a no-brainer: it's only a matter of time until you're all infected. But hey, why not make your last moments fun? After all, when it comes to tag, zombies really bite!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your friends start the game locked inside an abondoned military silo contaminated with Zombie-Maker-243. It's inevitable that you'll become a zombie, but that's not exactly the life choice that you prefer! Each turn, you roll your bones to run away from your (former) friends, but you'd better roll lucky: getting the wrong symbols means you've been contaminated and, BAM!, are instantly Zombified!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombified can also be played by groups even larger than 10 people! The central logo-staircase allows movement between the silo's underground floors. While there is no limit to the number of floors you can play on, a minimum of 5 people per floor is recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last player to become Zombified is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
