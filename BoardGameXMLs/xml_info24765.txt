			<description>All change is a tile placement word game that uses a turntable with 4 word slots. Players must place letters into the slot in front of them to make a 3 or 4 letter word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The turntable is then rotated to present the players with one of the other words, one that their opponents have been working on, which they must add to, change or remove tiles from to make a new word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
