							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Be Awesome At: Dungeon Design (Augmented Edition)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any GM can design a basic dungeon. A dedicated GM takes the extra time to craft exciting, logical and challenging dungeons that are so much more than a series of rooms stuffed full of monsters and treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be Awesome At Dungeon Design comprises over 200 pages of dungeon design advice from ENnie Award winning designer Creighton Broadhurst. Handling such subjects as a dungeon&amp;rsquo;s purpose, design, ecology, dressing and physicality as well as a score of ready-to-go dungeon dressing tables and more Be Awesome At Dungeon Design can help you build more awesome dungeons.&amp;gt;Whether you are a new GM just starting out, or a grizzled veteran, there&amp;rsquo;s something for you in Be Awesome at Dungeon Design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this book, you get two versions: a PDF and a .epub files so you can read Be Awesome at Dungeon Design on literally any device!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why You Should Take My Advice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In short, I've been around the block.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've been on both sides of the designer/publisher fence. In 1999, I started out as a hungry, wildly inexperienced and tremendously naive freelancer. Now, I'm a grizzled (nay veteran) publisher and editor who has written, edited and developed well in excess of 1,000,000 words of gaming content. I've written for big and small publishers alike and won an ENnie for Madness at Gardmore Abbey (2012 [Silver], Best Adventure). A partial list of my design credits includes: Wizards of the Coast (Monster Manual V, Exemplars of Evil, Madness at Gardmore Abbey), Paizo Publishing (Dragon Magazine and Dungeon Magazine), Expeditious Retreat Press (Legacy of Darkness, Plague), Kobold Press (Deep Magic), Rite Publishing (Pathways magazine, Adventure Quarterly) and Raging Swan Press (Retribution, Shadowed Keep on the Borderlands, The Sunken Pyramid).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During my early freelance days I was very lucky to have a mentor of sorts. Stephen Radney-MacFarland at the time was the RPGA's Big Cheese and my Living Greyhawk boss. During the course of the campaign, he gave me countless pointers and pieces of advice on how to commission, edit and develop modules. He gave me tremendous insights into the design process both in the campaign and at Wizards of the Coasts. (Luckily, he also didn't strangle me despite serious provocation on several occasion). During my time on the campaign I worked on over 100 modules and wrote another 20 or so myself. I had a lot of time to practise his suggestions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2010, I founded Raging Swan Press and have built it into one of the most successful, prolific and recognised publishers of Pathfinder compatible products in the multiverse. I've worked closely with dozens of freelancers and to date (November 2013), have released over 160 supplements, adventures and player aids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I want to share with you the insights and advice I've received over the years. I was lucky enough to have a mentor, but you might not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
