Do you take the risk to roll again?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GREEDY GRAB&lt;br/&gt;Be the quickest player to roll colors that match the center cubes and grab them! Roll again before other players and grab what&amp;rsquo;s left!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YOU SCORE!&lt;br/&gt;There are so many ways to score in this game that you may think you&amp;rsquo;re way ahead of the competition! But watch out&amp;mdash;a few quick rolls, and your competition could catch up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BLOTCH OUT!&lt;br/&gt;Try not to Blotch Out! Avoid the &amp;ldquo;Color Blotch&amp;rdquo; Spectracubes. Sound easy? Not so fast&amp;hellip;You&amp;rsquo;ll learn a lot about chance in this game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RUMMY ROLL&lt;br/&gt;Quick eyes and fast rolls get you winning&amp;mdash;as you place your Spectracubes into Rummy straights and sets!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SPECTRA-SLAM!&lt;br/&gt;Roll the Spectra-Slam cubes to win. This game gets more intense as players approach the 15 point threshold to winning!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
