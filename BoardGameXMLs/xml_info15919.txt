			<description>A game that combines rolling dice and exercise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Objectives...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective 1 - To be the first person to completely shade in the entire body pad by rolling those parts with the white dice: which means you&amp;rsquo;re totally fit to enter the track and field competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective 2 - To collect enough cash to pay your way onto the game board (track and field events).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective 3 - To be the first person around the track and cross the &amp;quot;Finish Line&amp;quot; to collect the Gold Medal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throw the dice. The numbers thrown will correspond to a body part on the figure illustrated on the player's game pad. The referee pays the player the amount of money indicated on the body part. The player then shades in that body part and the dice are passed to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player rolls doubles, the player must choose to either perform an exercise or, in an attempt to avoid exercising, pull a Chance Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Etc...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
