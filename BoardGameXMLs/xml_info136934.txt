			<description>In Whiskey Gulch, players compete with each other to accumulate resources and money in the post-Civil War American West.  Each player controls a family that is attempting to increase their holdings through worker placement, politics, and violence.  Players interact with each other and the harsh environment of the West in an attempt to become the most powerful family in the town of Whiskey Gulch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn begins with an Event Card that affects all players.  Players then select two action cards and place their workers on their holdings.  Then each player reveals an Environment Card that affects them specifically.  Actions are then carried out and combat is resolved.  To end the turn players gather resources from their property.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whiskey Gulch has 3 ages that each last 8 turns.  Scoring is based on a combination of money, resources, political offices held, and buildings constructed at game end.  There are many paths to victory, but only one winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whiskey Gulch is in post production. Release in Q2 2013&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
