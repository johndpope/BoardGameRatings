							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombie Rush</name>
									
			<description>You didn't have time to get ready, didn't have time to make sure everyone could get out of the house. How were you supposed to know the evil walking dead were going to be knocking at the door? You couldn't have known, you couldn't be ready, and now it's time to rush out the door, and into any car that works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie Rush is a Print and Play real-time speed game, where you're trying to get all of your family members (cards) out of the house before anyone else does. You score two points for each family member that escaped (each card in the central, shared, scoring area). Each family member left in the house, or dead is worth -1 point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can use their escape routes to get people out of the house before they finally make their escape into the central scoring area. Players place vehicle cards in the center to start piles of escaping family members (the number on the card must go up one each time you place a new family member on the pile).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When zombies appear, they eat whoever is next to them in the deck, but if you've equipped one of the members of your family with a shotgun, you can put the zombie in the dead pile (with any already-dead family members) and save a life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plays from 2-6 players, plays best with 3-6. Each round takes about 5-10 minutes, with a full game (to 60 points) playing in about 30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands, Re-themes, Re-implements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Ligretto&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie Rush is nearly language independent. If you know the word 'shotgun', you're in good shape. Rules in English only, as of now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
