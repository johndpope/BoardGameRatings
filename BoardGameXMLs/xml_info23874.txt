							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Little Golden Book Circle of Friends Game</name>
									
			<description>Spin the spinner and move your Golden Book Token clockwise around the spiraling gameboard.  Each time you land on a Saggy Baggy Elephant FACE Square, turn over a card from the stack.  If you turn over a Saggy Baggy Elephant card, move forward on the game board to the next Saggy Baggy Elephant Square and turn over another card.  If the card you turn over is not Saggy, move forward to the nearest square that matches that character card.  Your turn is over.  If you land on a BIG Saggy Baggy Elephant and his trunk points to another square, follow his trunk (up or down) to that square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach the CIRCLE OF FRIENDS, land on the Final Saggy Baggy Elephant FACE Square and turn over a matching Elephant card, enters the Circle and wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
