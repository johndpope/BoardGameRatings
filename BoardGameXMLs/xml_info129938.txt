							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Where&#039;s that Chipmunk?</name>
									
			<description>One player hides the stuffed chipmunk and then selects one or more picture clue tiles, at least one of which should give a hint as to the animal's location.  Players then seek out the chipmunk, with the finder earning the right to hide him the next time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hide him INSIDE or OUT! Clue cards point the way. Can you find the chipmunk? Three ways to play! Each time you find him, an acorn you'll earn. First player to get three will win, and all will learn!   &lt;br/&gt;No reading required!   &lt;br/&gt;3 ways to play! Includes Rules for Beginner, Advanced &amp;amp; Team Play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
