			<description>All-Star Baseball is a baseball video game series developed and published by Acclaim Entertainment. The series began in 1998 with the release of All-Star Baseball. The announcers John Sterling and Michael Kay have been added during the ballgame from 1998-2000 for N64. The final release in the series due to the bankruptcy of Acclaim is All-Star Baseball 2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the individual games, there are several different modes of play, such as exhibition, managing an existing Major League Baseball team or creating a team. Many North American cities are available for &amp;quot;expansion,&amp;quot; in addition to Mexico City and Puerto Rico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The series usually features pro-athlete Derek Jeter on the cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Star_Baseball,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Star_Baseball,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
