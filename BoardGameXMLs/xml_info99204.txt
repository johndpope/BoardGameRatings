							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hill Cantons Compendium</name>
									
			<description>subtitle:&lt;br/&gt;Being a Collection of Player Options and House Rules Various and Sundry for Classic Fantasy Role-playing Games Old and Dear&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;excerpts from the designer's blog:&lt;br/&gt;...a small horde of house rules, player options, variant classes and other crunchy bits from the last two years of play in the Hill Cantons in two cities (and a few countries if you count in my co-conspirators Skype games from Dragonsfoot). ... I compiled these various bits into a working document called the Hill Cantons Compendium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although a good chunk of the main section is likely only of interest to players in the campaign, the appendixes--most notably the three new variant classes for Labyrinth Lord and it's Advanced Edition book-- may be of greater interest to you the faceless hordes of the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment:&lt;br/&gt;Classes introduced are the Mountebank, the White Wizard and the Feral Dwarf.  Other options are presented for combat and character creation, along with a few odds and ends of house rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
