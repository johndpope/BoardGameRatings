			<description>Game that tries to encourage people into the hobby of Genealogy, ancestor hunting you might say.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generations is a board game with playing method which uses logic reasoning (in this regard, very similar to Cluedo) to solve a mystery of family history. Players search 7 regions of the United States for their make-believe ancestors, U.S. birthplaces, careers and lifestyles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to complete a family history (i.e. work out which facts are hidden, by eliminating facts that have been revealed to that player), wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several game options ensure that play never becomes boring and that different levels of skill can be achieved. Variations include:&lt;br/&gt;Logic Reasoning: Adapt for the time you have and the playing skill levels by varying the number of search categories. .&lt;br/&gt;Storytelling: At the end of the game, the winner can make up a story about the discovered ancestor's life using &amp;quot;facts&amp;quot; found during play. This variation develops imagination and communication skills.&lt;br/&gt;True Family History: Introduce players to real family stories as they &amp;quot;travel&amp;quot; regions of the United States asking questions about their pretend ancestors, where they were born, how they may have lived and how they earned their living.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents;&lt;br/&gt;playing instructions (for home and classroom)&lt;br/&gt;game board&lt;br/&gt;moving pieces&lt;br/&gt;dice&lt;br/&gt;cards&lt;br/&gt;lifestyle tokens&lt;br/&gt;career tokens&lt;br/&gt;ancestor worksheets&lt;br/&gt;realistic family tree charts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
