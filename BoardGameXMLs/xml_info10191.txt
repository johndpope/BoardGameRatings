			<description>This trivia game was manufactured for several years during the height of the sports trading card craze of the mid-90s, and came with a bunch of baseball cards.  The cards are like standard baseball cards, but have four trivia questions on the back, labeled single, double, triple, and home run.  The game proceeds like a game of baseball, but to determine the result of an at bat, the batter spins a spinner, which would say out, or one of the four hits.  If they spun a hit, they would have to answer the question on the back of the cards to see if they got the hit.  As with real baseball, there are three outs to an inning, and 9 innings.  The player who ends with the most runs wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
