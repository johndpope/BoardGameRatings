							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3</name>
									
			<description>The game has 80 playable characters (81 playable characters in Full Burst) including several new, making it the largest cast in the Ultimate Ninja series. The fighting system has been modified,with the Awakening Mode, a state that gave each character enhanced abilities when their health was low, being possible to be used at anytime during a fight, for certain characters. As in the previous games, the player can choose two characters to assist the player character in battle. The assisting characters now can also aid the playable one through the use of thirteen different types of combos. Additionally, the assistants have health bars, losing health whenever they get hit, ultimately being unusable when their health bars deplete. Several arenas have become interactive, making the player automatically lose a fight if they leave a specific area -&lt;br/&gt;- Wikipedia;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto_Shippuden&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto_Shippuden&lt;/a&gt;:_Ultimate_Ninja_Storm_3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
