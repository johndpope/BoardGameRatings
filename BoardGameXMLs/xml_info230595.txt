			<description>Publisher's Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeons are common in many fantasy settings. To make dungeons more interesting, appear occupied, puzzle players and potentially disguise things that are important with things that aren't, dressings should be added to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are 100 different things that can be found in a dungeon. Some are valuable, some are puzzling and some are just plain weird. Players may think that these are important, given that they are described in detail, but none are unless the GameMaster decides otherwise. All should help make a dungeon seem more alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;23. Chain - Six links from a sturdy iron chain. The link at each end has been snapped open, suggesting that this was once part of a much larger chain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the cover, one page the front matter and one page the introduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
