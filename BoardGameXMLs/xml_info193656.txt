							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Singularity: The Game of Artificial Intelligence</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artificial Intelligence is rapidly developing in our world today, and we stand on the cusp of a change so potentially radical it could alter the very concept of life as we know it. The power of exponential increases in technology could change everything before we realize it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SINGULARITY: The Game of Artificial Intelligence is a role-playing game that allows players to explore the world of Artificial Intelligence. It attempts to simulate this experience while allowing players interesting choices. This was developed as part of the Sweet 16 RPG Challenge on RPGGeek, a design contest to create an RPG that uses a D16 as the central mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
