			<description>Content: 37 cards in three colors with number 1-10,&lt;br/&gt;10 is double, 4 watering cans&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning each player gets a watering can for his hand.&lt;br/&gt;8 cards are put face down in the middle of the table.&lt;br/&gt;The rest of the cards are put face up and mixed up at the table. The players take turns in taking one open or one blind card, until all cards are dealt equally.&lt;br/&gt;All players lay out a blind card. At the same time they are opened. Are there any with the same color?&lt;br/&gt;If this happens, that player with the highest value of this color gets all cards.&lt;br/&gt;After all cards are played each of the players count their &lt;br/&gt;cards. The winner has the fewest cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
