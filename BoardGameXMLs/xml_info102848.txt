			<description>From &amp;quot;Adventure Summary and Background:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diotimus Verus was a traveling scholar for the Emerald Society. Two years ago, he discovered an ancient portal in the caverns beyond the dwarven enclave of Encali. Thinking it was a Portal of Anshar, he activated it. However, he found himself transported far from home, and was soon captured by a strange race of cat-like beings, who interrogated him in great detail about his homeland, the Coryani Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After being interrogated constantly for nearly two years, Diotimus learned that his captors had something planned which would spell trouble for the Empire, and that the life of the Patriarch of the Mother Church was in danger. Shortly thereafter, Diotimus managed to escape, and returned to Encali through the same portal he had left through originally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diotimus immediately went to a local friend of the Emerald Society, the dwarven jeweler Qomas. Explaining the problem, he borrowed money, clothes and a few small items from Qomas, and then set off for the city of Enpebyn, where the Patriarch was currently located.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
