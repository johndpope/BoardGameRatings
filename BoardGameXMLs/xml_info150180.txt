							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">De Tuin van Amon</name>
									
			<description>The rules from two authentic ancient Egyptian games, Senet and The Palm Tree Game, form the basis of this game. The track comes from a wall painting from a tomb in Thebes. The pawns mimic the escape of slaves from the garden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are the slaves who try to escape the garden of Amon. The game consist of two phases. During the day phase the players run through the garden, obtaining Fate Cards along the road. When a player reaches the resting place with his 5 pawns, the night phase starts. The players now race for the boat at the end of the vineyard. The first player who gets his 5 pawns on the boat wins the game. Fate cards, who resemble various Egyptian gods can help you or hinder you... The gods are unpredictable!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moving your pawns doesn't require any dice: the game uses Throwing Sticks ('Djebao' or 'Fingers'), just like in the old Senet game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
