							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lie Your Face Off!: Your Go-To Lies</name>
									
			<description>A mini-expansion to Lie Your Face Off! These are the lies that have always gotten you out of tricky situations, even when you were a baby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you don't have a Go-To Lie in you hand and you have to draw a card, you draw a Go-To Lie. Playing a Go-To Lie will always make you draw another one. These lies are more powerful than their base game counterparts, but if either the base game or the expansion deck runs out of cards, the game ends. Additionally, you'll need to complete another story for every expansion deck that you are using to end the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
