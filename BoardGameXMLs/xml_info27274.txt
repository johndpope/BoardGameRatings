			<description>Excerpt from rules introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Mammalian Mayhem &amp;quot;is a companion and sequel to our popular Saurian Safari dinosaur hunting rules. It is not just a supplement, though, but a complete rule system in its own right. As the title suggests, it enables the players to expand their hunting activities into the Age of Mammals, and to take on a wide range of quarry - living, extinct or simply mysterious - from prehistoric saber-tooths to modern African big game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player may choose to control either a human hunter character, or an animal. The hunters move, shoot etc. in a fairly conventional &amp;quot;skirmish wargame&amp;quot;  sort of way, by means of dice, while for the animal players we have introduced a card driven system, using an ordinary pack of playing cards. The intention is to bring out the difference between human intelligence - as represented, however unlikely it may sound, by the wargamer - and that of the quarry, who should combine a limited range of tactical options with an element of unpredictability. To compensate for this, the animals will usually be able to move faster than the hunters, and will have a decisive advantage if they manage to get to close range.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
