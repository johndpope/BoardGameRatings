			<description>TAU is a simple 2 player abstract strategy game that can be played with a marker and a piece of paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is played on a rectangular grid of n x m squared cells (n can be equal to m). Both players must agree on the grid size before the game starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 phases on the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1- Negotiation phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A random player starts by telling a number. Then the other player must tell a higher one or pass. The process is repeated until one of the players passes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player that 'passed' is called 'LOW', and the other player is called 'HIGH'. Write down the last number reached during the negotiation. This number is the called 'LIMIT'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A: 70&lt;br/&gt;B: 120&lt;br/&gt;A: 143&lt;br/&gt;B: Passes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A is 'HIGH', B is 'LOW' and LIMIT = 143&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2- Playing phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in turns. Each game lasts a number of turns equal to (m+n)/3 rounded up. A turn is considered a player's move (not 2 players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting with 'HIGH' players take alternate turns removing an entire row or column of cells from the grid, by drawing a line on it. The line must go through at least one square which doesn't already have a line. It is forbidden to draw a line so that it leaves the board with no 'unremoved' cells remaining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all the turns have been played, the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several rectangular groups of 'unremoved' cells have been created. Multiply the size of all the groups to calculate the score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following groups have been created: 1,1,2,2,3,6. Score= 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 6 = 72&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the final score is higher than LIMIT, the 'HIGH' player wins. Otherwise, 'LOW' wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer notes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TAU was evolved from OMEGA while teaching my students how to multiply in binary base. It uses Linkage's fewer/more idea. I recommend starting with boards of m+n = 20..30. Trivial sizes might be interesting only from a mathematical point of view. I recommend the shortest side to be at least 1/3rd of the longest one. Squared boards are particularly interesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thank you, Russ Williams and Nathan Morse for the corrections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
