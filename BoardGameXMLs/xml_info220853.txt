			<description>Description from te publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intrepid explorers have landed on a lost island in search of fabulous diamonds! Setting out from their base camp, the explorers hack their way into the jungle in search of the lost gems but will they get attacked by vicious dinosaurs first?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diamonds and Dinosaurs is a game for 1-5 players where players search a dangerous jungle made from a deck of cards. Depending on the suit played, either a valuable diamond is revealed, a dangerous dinosaur appears, or the player gains a weapon token into their arsenal to help them hack through the jungle or fight off dinosaurs. The player must roll a d12 to determine which jungle spaces are value for movement. Weapon tokens can be added to your dice roll to increase the number. However, fail a roll and your turn is over. The custom &amp;quot;dinosaur die&amp;quot; can make more diamonds appear, move the existing dinosaurs through the jungle or even repopulate the dinosaurs back to the playfield!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These hungry dinosaurs will take an opportunity to bite at you, so be careful where you end your movement! If you get bit, you lose health. If you lose six health, drop your diamonds and return to base camp. Base camp protects players from dinosaurs as well as mystic statues found in the jungle. Or you might find the hidden temple which houses untold riches... and danger! The first player to collect six diamonds wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
