							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Numenera Creature Deck 2</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build encounters quickly and easily, or create them randomly on the fly. Then give your players a look at their foes before plunging into combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This deck contains 99 weird and wondrous creatures of The Ninth World, drawn from Ninth World Bestiary 2, Into the Night, Into the Deep, and Into the Outside. When you need to build an encounter (either when prepping your game or at the gaming table), simply pick or randomly draw a card from this deck. You&amp;rsquo;ve got basic stats (with a reference to the book, for full stats and info) on one side, and an image to share with your players on the reverse. You&amp;rsquo;ll be astounded at the time you save!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Creature Deck 2 is fully compatible with Numenera Creature Deck. Combine them, or build your own random encounter generator by choosing creatures from each title to build your own custom creature deck. Between the two of them, you have almost 200 creatures to choose from!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
