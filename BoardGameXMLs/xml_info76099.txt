			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All New World of Lemmings (ANWoL) is a computer game released in 1994, as the third game in the popular Lemmings puzzle game series. In North America, the game was named The Lemmings Chronicles. It was published by Psygnosis and was the last Lemmings game developed by DMA Design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay remained similar to the original games, requiring the player to lead all the lemmings to their exit by giving them the appropriate &amp;quot;skills&amp;quot;. However, as the game's title suggests, both the gameplay as well as the graphics were &amp;quot;all new&amp;quot;. Fans disagree on whether or not this made it a better game, but no more lemmings games were made in the same style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They're back!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lead three Lemming Tribes - Egyptian, Classic and Shadow - as they attempt to tame new homelands. Featuring 90 leveles of enhanced Lemmings gameplay, larger Lemmings in crazy costumes, new objectives and, for the first time, bad guys to be confronted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
