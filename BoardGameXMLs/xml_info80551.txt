			<description>From the Publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 1: Infestation&lt;br/&gt;Even before the Exodus, Roswell, New Mexico was a place of mystery and conspiracy. Now its legend has grown stronger. Whatever the pre-Exodus military was hiding there, it&amp;rsquo;s important. Important enough that some people would do just about anything to get their hands on it. Infestation is an Exodus OPS campaign scenario for 4 to 6 characters of 4th to 6th level. This adventure directly precedes Submerged, and should be played immediately before it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2: Submerged&lt;br/&gt;A pre-Exodus device has brought you to a strange underwater settlement inhabited by inhuman creatures. Where are you? What is going on? And, more importantly, how will you return home? Submerged is an Exodus OPS campaign scenario for 4 to 6 characters of 4th to 6th level. This adventure directly follows Infestation and should be played immediately after.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
