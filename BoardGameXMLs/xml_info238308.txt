							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragon Fang Halls of Castle Dracos (5E)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner of the Gamehole Con 2017 Design Award!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago, among the remote peaks of the Moss Mountains, a band of scholars and adventurers calling themselves the Ordo Draconum came together to pool their resources on a singular subject &amp;ndash; dragons. They built a sanctuary for their work called Castle Dracos, and together with others they researched and experimented on these powerful creatures. Over time, however, the castle fell into ruin and the group disappeared. What became of their secrets? Many have wondered but the truth has remained hidden. Now, the halls of Castle Dracos have been found and adventurers seeking to claim the lost treasures of the Ordo Draconum swarm the land!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CD1 Dragon Fang Halls of Castle Dracos is the first module in the CASTLE DRACOS series from CUT TO THE CHASE GAMES. It is designed for a party of four to eight characters levels 2 to 4. This module covers the key areas of a region in the first level of Castle Dracos, known as the Dragon Fang Halls, introducing would-be heroes and treasure seekers to the dangers and mysteries of this lost site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is the first in the ongoing CASTLE DRACOS series of Fantasy Renaissance Adventure Modules brought to you by your friends at Cut to the Chase Games!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
