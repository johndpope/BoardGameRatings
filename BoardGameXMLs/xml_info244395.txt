The rebels and characters are not the only interested parties, as the authorities are watching the rebels, and the rebels themselves are not guaranteed to honour their bargain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure includes a colour 24&amp;quot;x32&amp;quot; battlemap of the meeting location which can be printed out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the cover, one the front matter, one the Open Game License and seventeen pages relate to the battlemap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
