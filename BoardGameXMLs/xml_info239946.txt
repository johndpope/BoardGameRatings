							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">New Salem: The Constable</name>
									
			<description>Due to the rising tide of witchcraft that is threatening to overtake the burgeoning town of New Salem, the founders have elected a Constable to help mediate the situation. Because it is feared witches may have infiltrated the founding group, the Constable will rotate among them to avoid any witch getting too much power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Constable will be in charge of triggering the plentiful array of new events that have become available, such as Seance, Conspiracy, and Drowning. There will be a random assortment of 7 events in each game to create a different witch hunt each time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gloom and Law buildings have been replaced with new sets that add or remove Despair with each building, but have an end game effect of adding or removing a lot more if you collect the set of 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mat will also accompany the expansion to better track the rounds, how the new events come out, and the current level of Despair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
