			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game start with a name and an honorific, both of which must be synonyms for &amp;quot;strong&amp;quot; (for example, &amp;quot;Mighty the Invicible&amp;quot;).  Characters have a single Attribute, Strength, which has a numeric value determined by 3d6 roll.  However, players can repeat the roll as many times as they like to get the result they want.  Play then proceeds as a series of narrative exchanged between the players and the Dudgeon Master (game master) who becomes the Dudgeon Master by being the last person to arrive for the gaming session.  Whenever an opposed action needs to be resolved the player is asked to spin a dreidel and announce the results, but &amp;quot;whatever the result, it will have no effect&amp;quot; and the game continues by Dudgeon Master fiat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
