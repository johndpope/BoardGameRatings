							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Phrenic Power: Ardent</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;At long last, play a phrenic class in your 4E game! With Phrenic Power: Ardent, you can modify the cleric class to become the Ardent, replacing the divine class features and replacing them with new, phrenic abilities. Draw upon your own internal reservoir of power, rather than that of a divine being, and unleash your phrenic power!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This initial release of Phrenic Power: Ardent contains everything you need to play an ardent in the heroic tier of levels, from 1-10. Included are new at-will, encounter, daily, and utility devotions, as well as new phrenic feats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As development continues, the paragon and epic tiers will also be released and this product will be automatically updated - so you don't have to buy anything else, you automatically get the later releases at no additional charge!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
