							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Huxley</name>
									
			<description>A Xbox 360 port was planned, but it has been put on an indeterminate hold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the near future, Nuclearites bombarded the world. Destructive earthquakes, massive tsunami and dramatic climate changes wreak havoc around the globe, isolating continents and driving the human race into chaos. Those who survive the destruction dream of tranquillity, but an eruption among the human race and the appearance of horrible mutants drives the world into further disorder. Racism and oppression cause rebellious uprisings and war that divide the landscape between two powers: Sapiens and Alternative. At the heart of the war emerges a powerful energy source called the Lunarites. The Lunarites were created by Huxley, a scientist and possible saviour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Huxley (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
