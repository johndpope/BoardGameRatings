							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brenainn&#039;s Legacy</name>
									
			<description>A One-Round Celtic Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago a trio of hags terrorized Eriu. Their names were Emer, Findige and Scathach. Early in their careers, the hags had slain a powerful wizard and taken his magical artifacts of power. With these artifacts, the hags could cast powerful magic, and they wreaked chaos on the land for many years. They were finally vanquished 200 years ago by the great hero Brenainn of Munster, who caused Findige to be imprisoned within the Stone Circle of War and Victory. The other two hags slew Brenainn and escaped. The people who lived nearby found Brenainn&amp;rsquo;s body in the center of the Stone Circle, and never knew exactly what happened or how he died. Many of the hags&amp;rsquo; artifacts were destroyed in the battle with Brenainn, but Emer&amp;rsquo;s and Scathach&amp;rsquo;s items still had enough power after the battle to cast one powerful curse or three lesser ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
