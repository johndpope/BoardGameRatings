			<description>BuySellorHold? is an intelligent and fun-filled action-packed game of strategy that helps players to learn about the Stock Market in an enjoyable and stimulating way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the game, share prices move after Government announcements, world news and company statements, and you will have to decide what to do. Real-life events such as buying a house, tax refunds and work bonuses also make a difference, as does luck, since the throw of a die changes share prices for all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three types of game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Introductory Game &amp;ndash; the basic game, simplified with fewer features to help people get more familiar with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Beginners' Game &amp;ndash; the addition of a few more features such as share dealing from outside investors, 'Life' events and portfolio valuations during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Advanced Game &amp;ndash; this option takes the game to the next level, and is ideally suited to people who have got to grips with the game and are looking for the ultimate challenge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
