			<description>This game is similar to tic-tac-toe, also known as noughts and crosses. However, it has a twist: a player's tokens are double-sided. Some of them show his colour on both sides, while others show the opponents colour. The idea is to bluff which are which.&lt;br/&gt;It is similar to tic-tac-toe in that the object is to form a line of your coloured tokens, on a (16 square) board. However, tokens can also be moved or flipped over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
