			<description>Jaque Quince: Simple rules and short strategic duels inspired by Bauhaus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to play in such a way that your opponent cannot respond to the opening play.&lt;br/&gt; Jaque Quince has 3 different suits. Each suit has a reference value with respect to the other suits (i.e., every suit is bigger than another suit). Each suit has 5 cards, and the bigger number cards have greater value. Aces are higher than 3, 4, and 5, but they are lower than 2. As there are 3 suits each with 5 cards, there are a total of 15 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player start's each hand of the match with 7 cards. The remaining card remains hidden to both players. One player opens a round with a card which must be responded to by a card with the same suit. If suit respond cannot be made, then must be responded by the same number. The player which played the greater value card opens next round. If responding player does not have either same suit or number then the opening player is granted points according to how long the hand was (i.e. the number of the round played).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jaque Quince was part of the 3rd Annual 18 Card Microgame Contest in 2016 and is planned to be published in some microgames compilations during 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
