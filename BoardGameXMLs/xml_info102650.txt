							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">My Pokémon Ranch</name>
									
			<description>My Pok&amp;eacute;mon Ranch is similar in concept to Pok&amp;eacute;mon Box, and allows players to transfer up to 1,500 of their Pok&amp;eacute;mon (if they have the Platinum update; without it the limit is 1,000) from up to eight separate Pok&amp;eacute;mon Diamond and Pearl Nintendo DS game cards, to a ranch run by Hayley, a friend of Bebe who runs the PC box system in these versions. Here, they can view their Pok&amp;eacute;mon rendered in 3D, while using their Miis to interact with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players do not need to own Pok&amp;eacute;mon Diamond, Pearl or Platinum to play My Pok&amp;eacute;mon Ranch. Players with or without the Nintendo DS game will be given six starter Pok&amp;eacute;mon and a new Pok&amp;eacute;mon at the start of each day. Additionally, each day Hayley will give the player requests for certain Pok&amp;eacute;mon not in the player's Pok&amp;eacute;dex to be added to the ranch, along with instructions on where to find them in Diamond, Pearl and Platinum. It has also been confirmed that players can obtain a special Mew and Phione.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Pok%C3%A9mon_Ranch,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Pok%C3%A9mon_Ranch,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
