			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pixel Loot - Dungeon Maker features 50 unique cards, each with a series of four interchangeable plot hooks. Drawing four Dungeon Maker cards and linking these plot hooks together will fill in the backstory for a random dungeon, and may even provide a motivation for your characters to explore it. More importantly, it gives you a series of ideas to trigger your own inspiration, keeping your stories fresh and your players engaged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card has the following four dungeon hook elements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Where is the dungeon located?&lt;br/&gt;    Who built it?&lt;br/&gt;    For what purpose?&lt;br/&gt;    What happened to the builders?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, along the bottom of each Dungeon Maker card is a series of four icons that help you randomize your dungeon experience. Each card has a retro pixel art icon (in keeping with the Pixel Loot theme) to represent the following variables:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    How many more exits are in this room (between 0 and 3)?&lt;br/&gt;    What kind of passage is each exit (10 possibilities: locked door, barred door, secret door, etc)?&lt;br/&gt;    What kind of trap protects this door or chest (7 possibilities: spike trap, falling rocks, poison, etc)?&lt;br/&gt;    What might players have to deal with in this room (10 possibilities: spider webs, green slime, an encounter, a chest, etc)?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
