			<description>Shadow Man: 2econd Coming is loosely based on the Shadowman comic book series published by Valiant Comics. It is the sequel to the 1999 video game, Shadow Man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the first Shadow Man title, the game features a dark and mystical atmosphere that also has a distinctly Cajun feel to it. In addition to the storyline being set largely in or around New Orleans, the game is filled with themes of death, voodoo, Creole characters and names, as well as elements of African spirituality. The game follows protagonist Mike LeRoi in his quest to protect the living from otherworldly forces as part of his responsibility as the Shadow Man&amp;mdash;which he became after being given (by the voodoo priestess, Mama Nettie) an ancient artifact called the Mask of Shadows, which gives the wearer the ability to traverse the worlds of the living and the dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story begins as Mike LeRoi resurrects from &amp;quot;Deadside&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Liveside&amp;quot; in order to contact Jaunty, a human-headed snake and a close associate of Mama Nettie. Unfortunately, after LeRoi finds and returns Jaunty to Mama Nettie, he is cursed with a powerful spell. Upon completion of his second task and after another encounter with Mama Nettie, LeRoi receives a note from a man named Thomas Deacon whom he goes about in search of, after which LeRoi learns of Asmodeus and the Grigori, as well as their plan to cause Armageddon. It is once again up to Mike LeRoi, or Shadow Man, to save the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acclaim found themselves in a bit of a controversy, when plans of advertising the title on small billboards on tombstones were announced, saying the would pay relatives for the advertising, adding that &amp;quot;poorer&amp;quot; families might be especially interested. They also said &amp;quot;It's a dark, gory type of game and we thought it was appropriate to raise advertising to a new level.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Shadow Man: 2econd Coming&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
