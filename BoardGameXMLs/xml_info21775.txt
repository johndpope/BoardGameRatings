							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ishi</name>
									
			<description>A Nim-like abstract game played in two parts. In the first part, players place stones on the board, and the player placing the last stone loses. In the second part, players proceed to remove the stones, and the player removing the last stone loses. In order to win the game it is necessary to win both parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key feature of the game is that the number of stones you can place or remove depends on how many stones your opponent placed or removed on the previous turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published by Ravensburger as part of their Pr&amp;auml;sent Series. Each item in this series contained two games; Ishi was paired with Go (the Ishi board is on the back of the Go board, and it uses Go stones as pieces).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
