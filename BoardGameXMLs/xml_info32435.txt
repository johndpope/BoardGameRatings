			<description>&amp;quot;Sackgasse&amp;quot; (=blind alley&amp;quot;) was published in the German magazine P&amp;ouml;ppel-Revue 1/86 as &amp;quot;Spiel im Heft&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board shows a map of a fictive city with a muddle of streets. The streets are marked with large dots, who divide them in several sections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players have only 3 tokens. They are brought into play under the &amp;quot;rule of distance&amp;quot;: no token is allowed to be too near of another one, that is it must respect a minimal distance of 3 dots to any other token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a player must move his tokens by 6 dots in total, but he must attack at least 1 opposing token by placing a token on an adjacent dot. Therefore, a move will always begin with a retreat of the attacked token. If it's not possible to reestablish the rule of distance for that token, it is eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner of the game is the player who eliminates 2 opposing tokens first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
