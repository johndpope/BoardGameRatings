			<description>SARS Wars &amp;ndash; Sha Si Zhan Qi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Towards the end of the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in Singapore in 2003, an enterprising media company published this simple roll-and-move board game, incorporating the public health education messages that were issued at the time. It was sold at branches of a book-cum-stationery shop chain, Popular Bookstore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is for 2 to 6 players and players each have a coloured pawn that moves along a spiral track towards an End Point. Along the way, players follow instructions on spaces they land on, including taking two kinds of chance cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;lsquo;Personal Hygiene&amp;rsquo; card is drawn when landing on a &amp;lsquo;Personal Hygiene&amp;rsquo; square &amp;ndash; players follow whatever instructions are written on these cards. The &amp;lsquo;See Doctor&amp;rsquo; cards may be drawn when landing on a &amp;lsquo;Symptoms&amp;rsquo; square, or also after landing on a &amp;lsquo;Check Your Temperature&amp;rsquo; square and rolling a 4, 5, or 6 (on lower numbers your temperature is normal, so you naturally don&amp;rsquo;t need to see a doctor).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may also get sent to Hospital or be put under Home Quarantine. Being in the Hospital is worse as the player proceeds to Home Quarantine after discharge from hospital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has lots of humorous touches that reflect the atmosphere at the time. One of the pre-game preparation rules is, &amp;ldquo;All players must wash their hands thoroughly before playing&amp;rdquo;. There&amp;rsquo;s also a rule concerning expulsion from the game, &amp;ldquo;You are not allowed to continue with the game when you are expelled because of reckless, irresponsible personal misconduct that jeopardizes the entire community&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach the End Point is the &amp;lsquo;overall winner&amp;rsquo; of the game. The other players can continue to play the game. Ominously, &amp;ldquo;the last player left is the loser, who may be punished appropriately&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
