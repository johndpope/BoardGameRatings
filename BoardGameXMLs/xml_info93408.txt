			<description>From the book's introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shocking truth about starting your own RPG Company&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first version of this PDF was only two pages long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s right. Originally this &amp;quot;secret tell-all&amp;quot; was just a gag. &amp;quot;How do you save money starting an RPG company? Don&amp;rsquo;t start one.&amp;quot; It came from an instant messenger conversation with one of my RPG publishing partners. We both got a chuckle over it. Then, as happens with all bad ideas, somewhere along the way I started taking it seriously. Now you&amp;rsquo;re reading the result. Just for the record, I do stand by the advice on the previous page. The single best way to save hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars and probably hundreds of irretrievable hours of your life is to avoid the publishing flypaper trap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though this began as a joke, the advice on the following pages is dead serious. I&amp;rsquo;m sharing with you 10 pieces of advice I firmly believe every potential publisher should know before taking the plunge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the advice on the previous page would save you a lot of time and money, we both know you&amp;rsquo;re not going to take it - and I would feel bad if you did. If you are serious about publishing, then the advice on the following pages will help you avoid certain pitfalls and set you on a path to publishing titles of which you can be proud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
