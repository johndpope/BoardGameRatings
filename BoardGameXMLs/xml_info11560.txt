			<description>Players play ravens and attempt to reach the castle while collecting as many magic stones as possible.  One stone is in the field between the starting positions and the castle; it must be collected before the castle can be entered.  When a raven first enters the castle it gets one magic stone.  On subsequent turns the player rolls two dice to get zero to two additional magic stones (there are 12 in the castle in addition to the one in the fields).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nature of a raven's current square determines the type of turn in has; in each case the player must guess a colour which will determine move distance.  On one type of field dice are rolled and spots in the guessed colour determine movement distance.  Another has a second player draw two cards and select one, with the first player's move distance determined by spots of the selected colour on the card.  In the final case, all players secretly select coloured chips and the guessed colour determines which chips will determine move distance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
