			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Guidebook to the Duchy of Valnwall is a FREE Labyrinth Lord supplement that expands on the critically acclaimed Guidebook to the City of Dolmvay and details the people, layout, and government of the Duchy of Valnwall. The Duchy is presented in broad strokes and is open to customization. It was specifically designed to give Labyrinth Lords a convenient and familiar fantasy setting to place their adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Guidebook to the Duchy of Valnwall is largely open content.
