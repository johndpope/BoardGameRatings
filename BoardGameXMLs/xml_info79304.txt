			<description>The angels have long since stopped interfering in the matters of the world yet there are a group of select few who watch over the land below as powerful Guardians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year the most promising individuals from across the lands are invited to take part in the Trials - their prize is to become a Candidate for Guardianship, to train amongst the clouds for a chance to join the elite ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet our story is not focused on those specially invited ones - instead meet Ella, a girl with a mysterious past having been found on the mountainside in a storm just under a year ago and now working as a maid in the local Inn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
