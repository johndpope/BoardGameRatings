							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guerrilla War: Simulation &#039;60&#039;s</name>
									
			<description>Guerrilla War is a hypothetical insurgency simulation game bearing similarities to the Vietnam War. There are rules for ambushes, infiltration, and airmobile assaults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was an independently produced game with Spartan components. The artwork for the mounted map has a rough, hand-drawn appearance. It uses rows of offset rectangles that permit six-way movement, similar to that allowed by a hex grid. The counter art also has a hand-drawn appearance. The counters are printed on colored stock and need to be cut out. The rules are simply bound by a stapled corner. The combat results table card has a mix of typewritten and handwritten info. The advertised selling price was $5.00.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Martin Campion's &amp;quot;guide to conflict simulations,&amp;quot; an article published in Moves magazine issue number 4, listed a playing time of 20 hours!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
