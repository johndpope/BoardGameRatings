			<description>Jeg har aldri (I have never) is an entertaining and fun party game that reveals wild stories, embarrassing moments, and interesting secrets about you and your friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains more than 200 weird, unlucky, and unexpected revelations, and this is a fun way to better get to know both new and old friends. You're guaranteed much laughter, fascinating stories and embarrassing secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are simple&lt;br/&gt;All you need is a group of friends and some beer, wine, or drinks. The first player draws a card and reads aloud &amp;quot;I have never ...&amp;quot;. For instance the first statement can be &amp;quot;I have never had sex with someone whose name I can no longer remember.&amp;quot; Then everyone who has had sex with someone whose name they no longer remember, must drink. The game can also be played with some coins, or some other way of counting points, or just by a show of hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
