			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Know Victory, Know Risk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No Risk, No Victory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What story do you want to tell?  A thrilling tale of knights of old?  A grim and gritty tale of street-level action and dirty dealing?  A star-spanning space opera?  Perhaps that no one has ever seen before, spun entirely out of the whole cloth of your imagination?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tools for telling all of these stories as an interactive activity are here in this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Victory System is a multi-genre Role Playing Game that gives you what you need to tell the stories that you want to tell.  Set your game in the Fantasy Era, the Near-Modern Era, the Space Era, or a Custom Era enitrely of your own design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can build Characters to suit the GMs campaign and their own concepts, from &amp;quot;talented amateurs&amp;quot; to skilled professionals.  Included are fully-integrated rules for Martial Arts, Magic, Artificial Enhancements (Mechanica), Powers, and Psionics, as well as all the weapons, armor, and miscellaneous equipment that makes adventuring possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory is by no means assured, however.  Danger lurks in every Era, and it's going to take a lot of Risk to see adventures through to the end.  No Risk, No Victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
