							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Enchanted Cave 2</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Enchanted Cave 2 is a randomly generated overhead view dungeon crawl action rpg.&lt;br/&gt;You will enter the Enchanted Cave and fight monsters, but you can only go down deeper into the cave. There is only one way out, the Escape Wings. Leaving with these will allow you to keep levels you gained during the descent as well as some equipment. Many items found in the cave will be lost if you leave, and everything gained during the current descent will be lost if you die. There is a skill tree where you can enhance abilities in areas such as magic, crafting/finding items and physical attributes. The dungeon gets more difficult as you delve deeper, but the equipment and items found improve as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
