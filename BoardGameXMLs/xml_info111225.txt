			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When things go bump in the night, victims need to become survivors. Eternal Shadows is a genre-specific rules variant for the Adventure Game Engine published by Green Ronin Publishing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This core book contains classes suited for play in a modern world. It contains modern gear, including firearms, and vehicles, and a magic system more suited to the uncertainty and tone of the Horror gaming genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are numerous resources for the Game Master to evoke feelings of helplessness, mortality, and horror at the game table. This includes fear and instability, monstrous opponents, and changes to the combat system for both PCs and their foes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shadows lengthen as heroes muster up the courage to fight. Do you dare join their number?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A copy of the Dragon Age Box Set is required to play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
