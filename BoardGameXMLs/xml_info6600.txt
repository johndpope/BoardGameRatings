							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Purse &amp; Pockets Plus</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;2 points to the first team who brings me a.....gum wrapper!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch the mayhem as everyone searches their pockets, purses, backpacks, and surroundings for the item needed.  It's up to the leader to determine whether a similar item is close enough (&amp;quot;here's a wrapper from chewy candy!&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This party game is sort of like a scavenger hunt, but it all takes place in a single location rather than running all around the neighborhood bothering outsiders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are categories of items to please just about everyone:  &lt;br/&gt;Purse (mostly things found in ladies' purses, best for an all female group like at a shower)&lt;br/&gt;Pockets (items typically found in anyone's pockets, good for most groups)&lt;br/&gt;House &amp;amp; Garden (if you're brave enough to have people rummaging through things in your house)&lt;br/&gt;Office (good for an office party or as an ice-breaker at a meeting)&lt;br/&gt;Something that...(items that fit a description, such as &amp;quot;something that has a team logo&amp;quot;, nice to mix this in with other categories)&lt;br/&gt;Kids (can play with an all children group or kids can play with adults, as long as the leader is an adult)&lt;br/&gt;Wild &amp;amp; Crazy (some items may be a bit wild for the standard group, but great for a bachelor or bachelorette party)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 to 3 teams race to bring the required items, and everyone seems to enjoy it whether their team actually wins or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
