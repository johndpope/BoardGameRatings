							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Old Lighthouse</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most fascinating adventure location, perfect for horror-oriented adventures, the Old Lighthouse stands on a small isle. The lighthouse building is a two-storey building with a slanted rooftop. Obviously, the lighthouse itself is taller than the rest of the building. The topmost level is just under the massive lantern. The first two levels of the building are a perfectly furnished house for the men on duty here. The isle itself features the ruins of an older unknown structure and a small dock, where rowboats and small ships can unload their cargoes. A pathway links the various locations aboveground and a small bridge in the middle of the island crosses a small chasm. A small network of caverns is also present, linking each other various spots of the isle. Some hints to use the lighthouse follow:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The entire isle is the hideout of a smugglers&amp;rsquo; band, the smugglers&amp;rsquo; chief pretend to be the man who tends the lighthouse but during the night the lantern is never lighted up.&lt;br/&gt;    The smugglers have their warehouse in the basement of the old ruins on the isle and pay the man who tends the lighthouse for his silence.&lt;br/&gt;    The lighthouse island is a eerie place, folks say that the lightouse is haunted. The man who looks from the massive lantern on top of the lighthouse is said to become mad as he see things too ominous to be reported.&lt;br/&gt;    Something is hidden in the basement of the old lighthouse. Tales are told about an alien thing that feeds upon the unfortunate who venture there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
