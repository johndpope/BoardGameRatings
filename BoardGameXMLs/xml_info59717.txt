			<description>Kids' Stories is designed to be used in a classroom setting. It has been designed so that students can play the game without adult supervision, making it possible to be used as an enrichment activity. In addition, it can be played with multiple students on one team and with an adult (or older student) supervising play - making it adaptable to small group activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Kids' Stories is to be the player (or team) with the most cookies in their lunch bag at the end of the game. A player earns cookies by successfully placing their groups of event/story cards in sequential order. The game ends as soon as one player reaches the bedtime space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;    *  Kids' Stories game board&lt;br/&gt;    * One six-sided die (numbered 1-3 twice)&lt;br/&gt;    * Four different colored lunch bags (playing pieces)&lt;br/&gt;    * Cookies (small clay imitations of real cookies for placing in the lunch bags as the players earn them)&lt;br/&gt;    *  One deck of basic event/story sequencing playing cards (45 cards in all - five 3-card combination groups, duplicated three times)&lt;br/&gt;    * One deck of advanced event/sequencing playing cards (48 cards in all - four 4-card combination groups, duplicated four times)&lt;br/&gt;A Master Sheet of all the card sequences (displaying all the card sequences - at a very small scale- to be used by Parent, if needed)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
