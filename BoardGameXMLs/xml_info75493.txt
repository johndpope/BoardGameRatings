			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Future Is Sooner Than You Think&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're planning an interplanetary trip to a transhuman tomorrow, there's no time like the present!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Spaceships 8: Transhuman Spacecraft updates the vessels and spacefaring information from the Transhuman Space setting to the GURPS Spaceships system. It includes dozens of new rules and design options applicable to that setting but useful for other realistic shipbuilders. It comes with over 50 spacecraft designs, gathered from across the Transhuman Space setting; each one provides enough information to make it useful even if you don't have the original supplements! Whether you're looking to fight with myriad combat-ready vessels, travel between worlds with Passenger Space Vehicles, or explore a variety of space stations, this supplement has you covered. In addition, it offers six alternate campaign possibilities for using these spacecraft in settings outside of Transhuman Space!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transport to the world of tomorrow is now boarding!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
