							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chompy Chomp Chomp</name>
									
			<description>Blobbidees have infested our garden. Ugh! They&amp;rsquo;re gross! Help us out by chomping as many as you can. Switch your target colour around and watch out for the Queen Blobbidee! Beat the high scores and tally up your blobbidee count. Share a keyboard or grab a couple of controllers and play with a friend to see if you can get even further!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The battle mode is a maze-based multiplayer romp in which participants chase each other around trying to eat the correctly coloured opponent. Underneath your chompy's feet you have a target the colour of the chompy you need to eat. At points in the round, the target colours change, turning hunters into hunted and vice versa. It's a frantic eat 'em up. Chomp your way through rich and varied arena environments and battle each other using frenzied power-ups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
