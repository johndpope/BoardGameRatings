							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rob Delaney&#039;s War of Words</name>
									
			<description>Rob Delaney's War of Words is a party game based on the tweets of Rob Delany, who has been named &amp;quot;Funniest Person on Twitter&amp;quot; by a number of media organizations. In the game, players are competing to be the first to cross a finish line, and they advance by doing well in three types of competitions, with the type largely being determined by the space on the game board where a playing piece is located:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;quot;This Means War!&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; On this space, the active player duels an opponent with each of them reading a Delaney tweet and the other players voting on who presented the line best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;quot;Firing Blanks&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; The active player reads most of a tweet, but leaves a BLANK in the text. The other players each suggest a word or phrase to fill in the blank; whoever the active player judges best moves ahead two spaces, while this player moves ahead one space for each answer that he matches with an opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;quot;Loaded Questions&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; This works similar to the previous category, but players are submitting answers to questions based on tweets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever makes it around the track first &amp;ndash; whether through an exact die roll at the start of a turn or spaces advanced thanks to doing well on a challenge &amp;ndash; wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
