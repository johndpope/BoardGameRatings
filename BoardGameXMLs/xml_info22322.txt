			<description>This is a proprietary take on the classic children's game War.  The game is played with a unique 36 card deck with three cards in each of 12 ranks, each represented by a different dinosaur.  The game is played until one player has possession of all of the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
