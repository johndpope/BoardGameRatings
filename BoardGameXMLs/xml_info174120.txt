			<description>From the Toy Vault website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's better than five players playing But Wait, There's More? Six players playing But Wait, There's More! This expansion comes with enough vote cards to play with sixth players. But Wait, There's More! It also comes with a sixth company card! If you play the team variant in the rules, you can play with up to twelve players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
