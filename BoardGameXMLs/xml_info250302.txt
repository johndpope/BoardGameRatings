			<description>Demanding card trick game for worshippers of the sun and moonstruck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two cults in competition&lt;br/&gt;  for human souls&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The servants of the sun play only suncards while the mooncards are reserved to the followers of the moon cult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though everybody has cards of the opponents party in hand, too. They are used when an opponent isn't able or willing to play one of his own cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the end the souls that could be won count, but only if also sanctuaries were build.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twilight is a demanding, complex card trick game. Of big significance is the quiet communication with your partner and to estimate correctly which cards your opponents have in hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
