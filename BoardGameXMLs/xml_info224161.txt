			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 3000 BC, there are many kingdoms in ancient Egypt, but none more famous than Nubia, the Middle Kingdom of Egypt. With the Great Pyramid of Khufu and the Great Sphinx at Giza, Nubia lay along the river Nile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Nubia: Ancient Kingdoms of the Nile, the players are Pharaohs. They each make their own kingdom, with a Great Pyramid and a Royal family supported by nobility. By using their building skills and spending wheat, stone and wood, their kingdom rises step by step. The winner is the player with the greatest kingdom, judged on their pyramid, their nobles and their gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, each player places building cards in front of them, like a pyramid. Higher cards must be supported from below, and they cost more to build, with payment being made when constructed. The new step triggers production from the cards in the pyramid to the left and right, going down from the active card, so planning ahead is very important to success. Each player worships their own God, which brings them benefits. There are more than twenty types of building cards, with many combinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
