							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bitten: Survive The Dead</name>
									
			<description>You and your group are survivors of the zombie apocalypse. Your supplies are low. Tension is high. On your last supply raid, there was an attack...and it is possible one of you has been bitten...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have five minutes to either gather enough supplies to leave your group...or you must discover and eliminate the player who has been bitten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bitten: Survive the Dead is a tense and exciting casual game for 2-8 Players with a 5-minute time limit. Players must attempt to gather one food ration, one water ration, one weapon, and the one available vehicle to leave the group, or they must discover which, if any, of the members of their group, have been bitten before time runs out and the bitten player becomes a member of the walking undead and eats your brains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original version was text only on cards in a tuck box. The second edition features all new artwork, modified rules including a few new cards, clay tokens for the items, and full illustrations on all the cards, the box, and the tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
