							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bleak Harvest</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The patients of Willowbrook Sanitarium are in grave danger...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With each new day, another patient at the Willowbrook Sanitarium falls victim to an unseen menace that leaves them practically catatonic. Each night, the survivors become easy prey to a servant of madness who has infiltrated the sanitarium, hoping to gather sufficient tributes for a massive sacrifice&amp;mdash;a ceremony that will herald the arrival of an incomprehensible evil to the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Duke, a cousin of the king, is caught in the middle, and it will take a band of extraordinary heroes to unravel the webs of deceit, rescue the duke, and lead a band of lunatics to disrupt the cataclysmic event known as The Bleak Harvest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you solve the mystery of the Bleak Harvest and save the lives of the inhabitants, or will you be driven mad and become in need of Willowbrook's Sanitarium yourselves, ripe for sacrifice?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bleak Harvest is a horror-themed adventure for 8th- to 9th-level characters.  Written for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and Fifth Edition Fantasy, this adventure can be dropped into any preexisting campaign with minimal changes required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module is recommended for mature players as it contains adult situations, mental illness, the possibility of the PCs needing to commit evil acts, and a very real chance players must give up some their characters&amp;rsquo; control in order to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perfect for use with Horror and Occult source material, as such themes abound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
