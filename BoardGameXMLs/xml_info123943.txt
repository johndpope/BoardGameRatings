							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monkey Quest</name>
									
			<description>Monkey Quest is an ever-evolving world that puts kids in charge and empowers them to chart their own adventures. Based on an original property, the massively multiplayer online game is set in the World of Ook, a mysterious realm where monkeys rule and five tribes must band together against one dark force that threatens them all. Players can team up in groups up to four, to work together to defeat monsters and solve puzzles. As players advance, their monkey avatars grow more powerful, unlocking each new tribe by completing quests and impressing the powerful tribal Monkey leaders. If players are successful, they level up in the tribe and earn weapons and abilities. In true Nickelodeon fashion, Monkey Quest also offers relatable kid humor that will add to players&amp;rsquo; entertainment experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
