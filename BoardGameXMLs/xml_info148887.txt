			<description>&amp;quot;The Game of Promises and Ultimate Power&amp;quot; is mostly a roll &amp;amp; move design with some negotiation and voting in the long version of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Themed around British politics with the iconic black door of 10 Downing Street as the box art, the object of this game is to become Prime Minister. In the short version of the game, the winner is the first person to do so whereas in the long version, the role of Prime Minister can change hands and the game is said to be won by &amp;quot;the last person to remain in the game after all the other players have tired of the Prime Minister's leadership&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll and move their way around the board, trying to pick up Vote cards and debating other players if they land on the same space. In the short version, such debates are decided by rolling dice but in the long version the players must act out their side of the debate and the winner is chosen by a vote of the other players.  Players must also face &amp;quot;chance&amp;quot;-like Affairs cards when they roll doubles and may end up in Jail or Hospital where they must roll dice to be set free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players consecutively work their way through the Town Hall, Parliament and Ministry spaces to reach Number Ten. They are paid a higher salary for reaching each of those levels but then require a greater number of votes to proceed to the next.  In the long game, the current Prime Minister can influence this process by exercising special powers such as awarding a government grant to a player or sending someone to Jail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
