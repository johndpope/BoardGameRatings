							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crusader: Battle for Tobruk, 1941</name>
									
			<description>Part of the 'Four Battles in North Africa' quad. This was also sold in 'Folio' form in case some folks just wanted specific games covering their 'favorite' battle(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components consist of the following: a 'Standard' Rules fold-out 'sheet' (about 3-Full pages) for the game series; an 'Exclusive' Rules sheet(1-page); a 4-COLOR paper Mapsheet-(17&amp;quot; by 22&amp;quot;); a set of cardboard counters(around 120); and players must provide their OWN 6-sided DIE prior to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the Mapsheet are the Turn Record Track, a Terrain Key, and the set-up locations for the Units of both the 'Campaign' &amp;amp; 'Sidi Rezegh' games. Overall, the COLOR of the Mapsheet is WHITE with BLUE-(Water/Sea, Allied 'Fortified Box', Minefield Hex-sides), BROWN-(Rough), Light GRAY-(Broken), &amp;amp; Dark BROWN-(Roads, Trails). The Area encompassed by this Mapsheet is from the coast around 'Halfaya Pass' south to Ft.Madellena over to far South of Bir Hacheim upto West of Tobruk past Monument. &lt;br/&gt; The game counters are TAN-with BLACK print for Germans, TAN-with GREEN print for Italians, GREEN with BLACK print for British, &amp;amp; assorted Allied Units. Game scale is given as  1.7 Miles across each hex, each Turn represents 1-Day, and Units range in size from Battalion up to Brigade level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3-Scenarios included on the 1-page 'Exclusive' Rules Sheet: the full Campaign game~20 Turns; Sidi Rezegh~6-Turns(1~6); &amp;amp; The Dash to the Wire~5-1/2-Turns(7~12)-(the British skip their 1st Turn). The Exclusive Rules set out Supply Sources, detail the Tobruk Defenses, explain a British 'Diversion' attempt starting on Turn 6, and Victory Conditions for each Scenario. The Standard Rules has the Combat Results Table on the last 'inside' page. There are some 'interesting' location placenames such as 'Beer Bottle Hill', 'Hellfire Pass', 'Trafalgar Square', 'Libyan Omar', 'the Wire', and others of unique 'flavor'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Crusader: Battle for Tobruk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
