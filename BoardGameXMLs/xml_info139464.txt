							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Toymaker of Avenguard</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supernatural suspense, horror, and action await the unwary in Shadowglade! 500 years ago, the world ended. More than that, it was forgotten, the minds of those alive scoured clean of knowledge, history, and identity. In the intervening years, society has rebuilt as best it could, new alliances have been forged and blood-sworn enemies made as the surviving nations have begun to rediscover their roots. Out in the wilds and darkness, however, not all that lurks is friendly...or human...or even alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something dark stirs in the sleepy crossroads town of Avenguard. A string of murders of the innocent seems to have followed a cursed toymaker to town. Word spreads quickly and the weary toymaker resigned to his fate...&lt;br/&gt;But not all is as it seems. Rumors sift through the town, stories. Some are dark and terrible, which if true means the toymaker is a greater monster than even initially suspected. But others paint a different portrait and offer the slim chance that, just maybe, the toymaker is innocent himself...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Toy Maker of Avenguard is a Pathfinder OGL 3.5 adventure designed for 2-6 player characters, levels 1-3. A rogue or bard will be a strong asset for any party but they are not required for the successful completion of this adventure. The Toy Maker of Avenguard is a loosely designed, open-ended adventure that will require a lot of investigation and a heavy amount of role-playing from the characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
