			<description>Need for Speed World (previously known as Need for Speed: World Online) is an active installment in the long-running racing video game Need for Speed franchise published by Electronic Arts. This iteration has been co-developed by EA Black Box and EA Singapore. It is the first MMORG in the Need for Speed series (though Motor City Online was originally conceived as a Need For Speed game), and is available exclusively for Windows-based PCs. World was released worldwide on July 27, 2010. However, people who ordered the Need for Speed: World Starter Pack had an early &amp;quot;head-start&amp;quot; in the game, which started on July 20, 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;World takes on the gameplay style of Most Wanted and Carbon, focusing on illegal racing, tuning and police chases, and adds classic MMO elements to the mix such as special abilities. World also features the cities of Rockport and Palmont, the cities of Most Wanted and Carbon respectively, into its map design, along with a night/day cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before September 8, 2010, after reaching level 10 and access to only tier 1 and certain tier 2 cars, the player would not be able to progress further in the game and would cease to earn any more points. To continue the game, the player had to purchase the Need for Speed World Starter Pack. Without it, the player was allowed to play the game for as long as he or she wants, but the game wouldn't progress. On September 8, 2010 World had passes 1 million registrations. To celebrate that, the game was made free-to-play and the level cap was removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Need for Speed: World&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
