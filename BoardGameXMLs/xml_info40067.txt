			<description>Gratuity Not Included is a fast paced card game placed in a restaurant during the Friday night rush.  Each player grabs their server&amp;rsquo;s apron, a stack of menus and their handy notepad to seat patrons and fill orders.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;A player's section of the restaurant has a number of tables depending on game length.  Patrons are placed on the tables and wait for service.  Players must play food and drink cards on patrons according to their tastes.  When orders are filled the patron will &amp;lsquo;tip&amp;rsquo; a portion of the meal cost to the player.&lt;br/&gt; The goal is to get the most tips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gratuity Not Included is currently in Alpha rules development and playtesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
