			<description>Using the same chassis as W1815 this game covers the battle of Blenheim 1704.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game seeks to demonstrate the importance to the Franco-Bavarians of holding the line of villages so as to outflank Allied attacks between them. The Allies must therefore risk attacking these strongly held outposts to clear their main attacks. The villages also give the opportunity to the Franco-Bavarians to use counter-attacks. The French army is no longer the superb weapon of Cond&amp;eacute;, Turenne or Luxembourg: a force hurling itself forward in a furia franchese. It cannot out face the Allies in the open, but by carefully using counter-attacks it can yet confound the Allies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Allies need to balance their attacks along the line to keep the Franco-Bavarians pinned and prevent them moving reserves into areas subject to the main Allied attack. Forces are divided into foot and horse, and these two arms will support each other in combat. Problems arise where foot and horse are not both available. Then infantry can find themselves pinned and shelled, and cavalry unable to attack effectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
