			<description>The Board Game &amp;amp; App for Tech Geeks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each playing card has five words or phrases and the players must describe them to their team, as quickly as possible. The teams move round the board based on the number of words or phrases guessed correctly and the number of general knowledge questions they answer correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general knowledge questions are designed to trip the teams up and slow them down (or get them drunk). The game requires quick, lateral thinking and the ability to describe what a player sees on a card, really fast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round lasts 30 seconds and the topics include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     People (VCs/CEOs and other tech business leaders)&lt;br/&gt;     Technology (Software, Hardware, Mobile, etc)&lt;br/&gt;     Media (TV, Newspapers, Blogs, etc)&lt;br/&gt;     Companies (Start-ups, Unicorns, Multi-Nationals)&lt;br/&gt;     Tech Miscellany (Cool random tech stuff)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to move round the board and reach the end before the other team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pi bridges the physical and digital worlds and can be played as a board game or app or a mix of both and IMPORTANTLY it&amp;rsquo;s really easy to learn to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
