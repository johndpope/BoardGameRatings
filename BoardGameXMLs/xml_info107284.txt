							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grand Prix Manager</name>
									
			<description>Grand Prix Manager places the player in the role of the manager of a Formula 1 racing team, with the ultimate goal being to reach to highest management rating. This can only be achieved by winning the championship on the hardest difficulty setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can choose how many races to take part in over the course of a season, and after each race the player is presented with a race performance screen, followed by car upgrade options. Revenue is generated through sponsorship, however sponsors will base their investment on their satisfaction with previous race results. This income is used to hire mechanics and a driver from a set list of well known Formula 1 drivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player makes choices from menu screens regarding aspects of the car such as the tires, depth of tire tread and angle of the rear wing, and is then shown highlights of the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Grand Prix Manager (1984 video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
