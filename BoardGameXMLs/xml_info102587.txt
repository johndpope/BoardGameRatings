			<description>Smashing Drive is a racing video game developed and published by Gaelco and distributed by Namco. The game was first released in arcades in 2000 and was ported to the Nintendo Gamecube and Xbox in 2002 by Point of View and Namco. Subsequently, it has been brought to the Game Boy Advance in 2004 by DSI Games and Namco.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player races against time and another psychotic cab driver through New York City to get the cash. The game is divided into 4 difficulties, each of which contains 3 different levels (with the exception of &amp;quot;Dusk and Wired,&amp;quot; which only contains one). If the player manages to beat the rival cab in all 3 levels of a difficulty, he would be taken to a bonus stage with the only available route being all of the Risky Routes. At the end of a stage, the players score would be based on the amount of time it took to reach the destination, the cab's condition, the rival being beaten, the number of Turbo powerups obtained, and the number of Risky Routes traversed. Unlike many racing games, the horn actually has a functional use of making (most) mobile vehicles move aside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Smashing Drive&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
