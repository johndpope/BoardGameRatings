							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Harlequinade: Ideal World (Version 3)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has been officially certified &amp;lsquo;politically incorrect&amp;rsquo;.  Harlequinade, with its cynical, disrespectful world view has been known to induce fatal moral indignation in people who have had their sense of humour surgically removed and replaced by a corncob.  If you are a po-faced moral nazi, or mentally ill,  please read no further for your own peace of mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Harlequinade, players play Victims (characters) who proceed through a Nightmare (adventure)  run by The Harlequin (GM).  The Harlequin is also sometimes called &amp;quot;You Callous Bastard&amp;quot;.  All Nightmares are set in the Ideal World (the game world).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victims have eight Primary Attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Agility, Health, Willpower, Presence, Beauty, and Alertness).  Each Primary Attribute has a numerical Rating of 2-6.  Victims also have Combat Attributes with Ratings derived from Primary Attributes.  Victims select an Archetype (class): Nobody (the default), Soldier, Thug, Thief, Fatboy, Lunatic, Cultist, or Gentleman of the Night.  Victims then generate money to buy Props (equipment).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actions are either Resisted or Unresisted, each using a different mechanism.  For Resisted Actions the opponents compare base Attribute plus Difficulty Modifier plus 2d6--the highest score wins.  For Unresisted Actions the Victim adds Base Attribute and Difficulty Modifier and subtracts 2d6, attempting a result less than zero for success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
