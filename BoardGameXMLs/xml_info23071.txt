			<description>Each player selects one playing board which can be used either side up. Once a playing board is selected it must be used throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;Each player in turn takes one card from the draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;The Draw Card is placed against the matching color on the playing board. Red goes with red blue with blue etc.&lt;br/&gt;If that color is already covered on the playing board the draw card is placed in a discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to complete 3 words in a row wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;An excellent game for 4-8 years old to learn word making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
