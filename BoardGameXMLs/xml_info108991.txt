			<description>Foundations is a 2 players abstract strategy game that is played using board and pieces of an Isaac set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is getting rid of the value of your pieces by carefully placing them on the board or on already played pieces, thus creating a tridimensional structure developed on different levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns placing one of their pieces in ascending order of length. If they can't find space for a piece, they must build on the next level in height so that both ends of the piece rest on top of two pieces of its same colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When players are forced to build on new levels, they can begin with a smaller piece, but they must then play again in ascending order of length and they cannot play in lower levels anymore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when players cannot place any more pieces on the board. The winner is the player with less points still in hand. In case of a tie, the winner is the player with less points at the highest level on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
