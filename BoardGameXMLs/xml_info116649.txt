							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Southern Belle</name>
									
			<description>Southern Belle is a train simulation video game published by Hewson Consultants in 1985. Southern Belle was unique at the time of release in that it was the first 3D steam train simulator available for home computers. The game allows the user to take over the fireman and/or driver duties on a King Arthur class passenger steam locomotive on the London to Brighton line. It was programmed by Mike Male, who teamed up friend and railway buff Bob Hillyer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to complete a simulated journey of the Southern Belle steam passenger train from London Victoria to Brighton while keeping to speed regulations, being careful not to derail when going around curves and completing the journey on time. There are various options available including a demonstration run, where the computer takes control of the locomotive, and a number of challenges such as beating the real record breaking run for that line, set on July 26, 1903 (at 48 minutes 41 seconds).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The graphics were &amp;quot;vector-style&amp;quot;, but because of the limitations of the ZX Spectrum and such computers, the graphics were minimal. The framerate was very slow, updating only once per second. This was particularly notable when playing in &amp;quot;Fast&amp;quot; mode, where you could speed the gameplay up x5 by pressing the &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; key. Also, the main gameplay screen lacked colour, with most versions being in monochrome. However, the ZX Spectrum version did include a &amp;quot;red&amp;quot; fire. Additionally, there were sections of line where there were no buildings visible in the foreground, leading to criticisms that the game looked as though the countryside had been hit by a nuclear bomb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Southern Belle (video game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
