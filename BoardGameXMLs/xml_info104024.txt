							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spaceport Black Orchard</name>
									
			<description>From the product description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Black Orchard is in business to shift cargo and lots of it. The port provides amenities for visitors and passengers alike, but its primary bread and butter is heavy cargo. This Destination is a fully described spaceport providing a location for refueling, diagnosis and refitting of any vessel. This technological center bustles as it serves and services ships from all over. A long flat strip with five enormous towers, it offers repairs for obscure nanotech infestations or sensor diagnostics for the most delicate of damage systems. Characters can transfer cargo, take on additional munitions or take time out for a ground-based adventure; all are possibilities here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Destinations series by Tabletop Adventures is your gateway to the universe, providing flexible, creative, stat-free settings that you can use to bring life and adventure to virtually any game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spaceport Black Orchard is described in three sections: an Introduction, including background information and a description of what the port looks like from the air; Spaceport Layout, with details about each individual tower; and Bringing Black Orchard to Life, which gives adventure seeds and plot hooks that could be useful in nearly any science fiction campaign. Text is provided to read aloud directly to your players if desired, giving descriptions of the various areas of the port. Also featured is an artist&amp;rsquo;s rendering of the location by Gillian Pearce.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
