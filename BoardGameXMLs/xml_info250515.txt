			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hundreds of years ago a giant declared himself the Jarl of one of the tribes of Icewind Dale. Unbeknownst to them, the soul of a long forgotten dragon corrupted them and what they called home would soon be called a tomb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many years later a group of dwarves found the Tomb of the Mountain Splitter, after they paid their price on those halls, the map to the tomb and it's treasures were lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However the map has resurfaced, will your party be able to explore these unhallowed halls? Will they be able to defeat the Mountain Splitter once and for all? Will they be able to find the entrapped dragon and destroy the artifact? Or will the curses of Colrath-kilrah escape the tomb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 3rd - 5th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
