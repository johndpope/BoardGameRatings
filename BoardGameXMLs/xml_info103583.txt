			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Thorian Faction Sourcebook, an in-depth guide to the Inquisitors that follow the Thorian philosophy. We hope that this book will helps Inquisitor players and Games Masters in their scenarios and campaigns, by providing detailed background information on this slice of the Inquisition, including numerous examples of characters, scenario ideas and events that you can use to form the basis of a campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this book is not on the game of Inquisitor, but on the shadowy realm that exists as the backdrop of your games. The intention is to illuminate the character of Thorian Inquisitors, through their history and exploits, rather than to provide hard and fast rules and game mechanics. We will also take a look at an aspect of the Inquisition at the whole - their practises, beliefs or structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sourcebook contains the following sections:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The History of the Thorians: An overview of how the Thorian philosophy came about and how it has evolved since its adoption by members of the Inquisition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thorian Splinter Factions: A look at some of the diverse philosophies and goals that exist within the wider Thorian framework of beliefs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thorian Personalities: We examine some of the most notable proponents of the Thorian philosophy, their followers, achievements and battles, and the foes that they faced. You may wish to use these characters in your games, or perhaps they will serve as inspiration for your own creations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thorians within the Imperium: A detailed look at how Thorian Inquisitors operate within the wider structure of the Inquisition, in particular their preferred methods of operating and their allegiances to other organisations within the Inquisition and without.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thorians and other Factions: How Thorians view other philosophies and how they are viewed - a look at their allies and opponents within the Inquisition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cells and Conclaves: A treatise on the means by which factions can be formed and how Inquisitors of similar beliefs communicate with each other and work together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thorians in Games: Rules and suggestions for players and Games Masters for Thorian Inquisitors, their warriorbands, favoured wargear and weaponry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
