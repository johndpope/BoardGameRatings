			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Captains Council is the governing body of Freeport. Councilors make and enforce the laws, defend Freeports interests at home and abroad, and generally ensure that the city continues to prosper. Since Freeport is a city based on mercantilism and enlightened self-interest, councilors also make sure that they profit from all of the above. The Captains Council isnt only about prestige; its also about filthy lucre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The council, like many aspects of the city, is a legacy of Freeports piratical past. In the rough and tumble early days, every pirate captain was considered an equal. Decisions were made by a simple majority, and duels were as common as debates. As the city grew, there were just too many captains to continue on as before. When Captain Drac became sole Sea Lord of Freeport, he knew it was time for change. He also knew he couldnt simply disregard the captains of Freeport, or his lordship would be over in a matter of days. His compromise solution was the creation of the Captains Council. He chose six powerful captains to help him rule the city. They enforced Dracs edicts and handled the day-to-day business of governing the city. These men became the first Captains Council of Freeport. Under their rule Freeport grew and prospered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
