			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So- people say you&amp;rsquo;re pretty good in a fight. &amp;quot;Hero&amp;quot; might be putting too fine of a point on things, but adventure certainly seems to find you even when you&amp;rsquo;re not actively seeking it out yourself. You&amp;rsquo;ve solved mysteries, foiled plots, and fought evil with steel and spell. You&amp;rsquo;ve seen all manner of creatures and traveled from the most impressive cities to the most simple villages. A place like Flintpoint here hardly even qualifies as a village- it&amp;rsquo;s more like a waystation on the road around the marsh. But don&amp;rsquo;t write us off just yet. Someone needs to know about the things we&amp;rsquo;ve been hearing in the marsh. Dangerous things. Menacing things. Wild things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marsh of the Wild Things, an adventure for 8th level characters, is easily dropped into practically any fantasy campaign setting. Much of this adventure takes place outdoors, making it especially suited for adventuring parties with a Druid, Ranger, or other characters with the Track feat. Taking inspiration from classic fantasy adventures, Wild Things challenges heroes with unexpected foes, a strange ally, and lots of heart-thumping combat.&lt;br/&gt;The details:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     44 pages of content&lt;br/&gt;     2 GM maps,&lt;br/&gt;     1 player handout&lt;br/&gt;     Includes suggestions for adjusting the difficulty for higher or lower level heroes.&lt;br/&gt;     Includes both a full version and a printer-friendly version &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are your heroes ready to face Wild Things? Find out today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
