			<description>Players race to get rid of all their seven cards by matching them with the card uppermost on the discard pile. There are no turns, so players have to keep their eyes open and brains switched on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's matching mechanics are based upon the Stroop effect. Two different modes mean that things are never simple and the matching method can reverse at any given moment; colour&amp;gt;word or word&amp;gt;colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Punishments for incorrect matches and two different types of special cards spice things up a bit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description of the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
