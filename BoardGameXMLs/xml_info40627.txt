							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">WinniM</name>
									
			<description>A word card game in which you lay down and/or add to words from your hand.  The unique feature of WinniM is that each card can stand for a vowel or consonant, depending on which end is up.  The 105 cards have all possible combinations (5 x 21).  This adds an extra dimension: in addition to rearranging letters as you add to your words, you can flip the cards to change the letters in the word.  In the Wild version, you can also steal from and add to opponents' words as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the deck runs out and no one can play any more, score for the number of cards you have on the table and for the length of each word, longer words giving many more points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
