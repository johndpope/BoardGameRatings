							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Optional Goodie: Converted Classes</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players and GMs used to the original game and its clones, will &lt;br/&gt;have noticed that several of the core classes have been reworked. For example, the former cleric and druid have been discarded in favor to the new friar, mystic and templar classes. These new classes are based on the idea of servants of the faith praying for minor divine  interventions,  rather  than  getting  spells  as  clerics  and  druids do. Other examples include bards without spells and paladins that are more like knights getting a few advantages for serving the cause of Law. However,  it  is  inevitable  that  among  those  who  would  want  to  play a game of FANTASTIC HEROES &amp;amp; WITCHERY, some will regret this strong departure from the original classes. The present document for free download has been done for such players and GMs, in the hope it will cater to such a need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
