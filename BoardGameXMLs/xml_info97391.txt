			<description>From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the future...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After losing his only son in a car accident, a genius scientist named Dr. Tenma created a robot in memory of his son.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This robot was a scientific wonder unlike any other robot that existed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He had six super abilities including 100,000 horsepower strength, rocket-powered feet, and the Omega Factor, which allowed him to experience human emotions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the world, large numbers of robots were created to assist humans, however, the human race soon became afraid of the robots' capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The people are now trying to destroy the robots, causing the robotic race to rebel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Underneath it all, someone is plotting a scheme to create even more tension and ultimately bring war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Astro, who embodies both humand robotic traits, stands as a bridge between the two races and will always fight to reunite these two factions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Astro must use not only his super powers, but his human Omega Factor to bring peace to robots and humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
