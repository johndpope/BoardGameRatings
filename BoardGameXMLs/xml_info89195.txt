			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is part of the Gone Extinct Groovy Tube Book published by innovativeKids. It consists of a hardcover book, a tube of plastic animals, and a game board in the attached box. The book describes various extinct animals, including the plastic animals it comes with, and the game rules are on the last couple pages of the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Journey to Extinction Island is a roll-and-move game that has 2-4 players traveling several small paths to collect specimens from each zone (Water, Flyers, Forest and Swamp), while avoiding poachers. The first player to collect one of each type and make it through the final zone (the poacher camp) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
