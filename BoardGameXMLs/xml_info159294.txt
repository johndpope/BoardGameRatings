							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monastery of the White Rose</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two days ago while in the Village of Balis you heard a rumor of an abandoned monastery.  With such a deserted location already so close at hand one could not refuse the temptation of checking on its possible gains-whether it is treasure or knowledge that is to say.  Yet the gains must surely be worthy of someone as adventurous and brave as yourself.  Through further investigation of the rumors of the townspeople you have discovered that the old monastery is said to be haunted with the dead walking the grounds.  Directions were located and after a final day&amp;rsquo;s praying you set out to locate the Monastery of the White Rose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure takes a single PC into a deserted monastery to discover adventure! This adventure is for a single beginning adventurer or an experienced adventurer who wants to go alone on an adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
