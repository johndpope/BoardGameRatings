			<description>Very Monopoly-like Finnish (only?) business game. Roll &amp;amp; move, buy or pay, sell, win or declare bankrupt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components&lt;br/&gt;A board, eight building sets, 120 notes with different values, 100 action and block cards, car-shaped player markers and a dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;Players roll dice and move around the board illustrating a small town with eight blocks for houses and shops, kiosks, train stations and gas stations, two blocks for each. In the corners of the board there are a bank, a police station, a school and a factory. These involve action cards players must pick if they stop on the corresponding square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can buy free blocks from the bank when entering one (they can also negotiate themselves to buy and sell their own blocks). If the entered block is already taken, they have to pay rent for the owner. To increase the rent of the blocks, players can build them with corresponding buildings. Each building consists of 4-6 small wooden part. A house can be built as soon as a player has a block for it. To build other buildings, one has to own both of the blocks of that serie (say, both shop blocks). Buildings can be bought part by part, but only finished buildings increase the rent (one exception: houses without roofs increase the rent also).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player can own only two blocks for houses, other blocks as many as they want. Furthermore, player can build only one house. Since the number of shops, kiosks and both stations is also limited to one, player has to decide on which of the blocks he/she wants to build. The buildings cannot be later moved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player can't pay rent or other payments, he/she can sell his/her building blocks back to the bank and take mortages on empty blocks (these blocks don't give any income for the owner). If this wont bring enough cash, the player makes a bankruptcy and is out of the game. All blocks are returned to the bank and they are free to buy for other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last player in game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rule variations for two players&lt;br/&gt;Both players can own several house blocks and build two houses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
