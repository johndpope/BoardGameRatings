							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quotable Game</name>
									
			<description>Quotable Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: This is a game full of funny/insightful/awful quotes&amp;mdash;players rarely know who actually said these quotes, because honestly, can you name a single quote by Kim Kardashian? The objective is to either write the correct answer or trick your friends into thinking your answer is the right person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players: 3-8 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phones: *A companion app is in the works* For now exchange phone numbers with the other players. Players will text answers to the Reader each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scorekeeper: Designate a Scorekeeper&amp;mdash;this person needs to pay special attention to &amp;ldquo;Scoring&amp;rdquo; Section&amp;hellip;obviously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reader: Player with birthday closest to January 1 begins the game as Reader&amp;mdash;the Reader will facilitate each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The first Reader draws a card and reads the quote without revealing author.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. TEXTING ROUND: Players text Reader a guess of who said the quote (at this point, players either think they know the answer or are trying to think of a fake author to trick their friends)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Reader re-reads quote after all texts are received&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Reader announces all the options including correct author in any order. If 2 options are the same, only read that option once. (This includes repeat texts, and someone texting the correct answer.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. VOTING ROUND: After announcing all options, Reader calls for votes on each option. (Players MUST vote, and may not vote for their own answer, even if they believe it to be correct.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. Scorekeeper tallies/announces scores. Then player to left of Reader is now Reader and round is complete&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring: &lt;br/&gt;Player texts correct author of quote on answer card (5 Points)&lt;br/&gt;Player receives vote for their texted answer, if it was not correct. (1 Point each)&lt;br/&gt;Player votes for correct author of quote in voting round (2 Points)&lt;br/&gt;No player votes (or writes) correct author (3 Points for READER)&lt;br/&gt;First Player to 21 Wins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
