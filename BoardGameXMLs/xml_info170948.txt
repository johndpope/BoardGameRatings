							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Naginata</name>
									
			<description>Naginata is a direct confrontation between 2 samurai who clash in a Dojo. Both of them will try to reduce their opponent's life points to zero (0) to defeat them and win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players will firstly choose a Weapon to be their Starting Weapon. There are 3 Weapons available: Wakizashi, a light knife; Katana, a dangerous sword; and Naginata, a heavy halberd. Their choice is crucial to their strategy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, in each turn, both players will receive 3 Action cards. Action cards show 2 different actions in their opposite sides, so players will have to choose the action they want to use while losing the other one during that turn.&lt;br/&gt;Actions include Attack, Parry, Move and Unsheath. Attack allows players to damage their opponent. Parry cancels an opponent's Attack if played in front of it, and also applies a penalty to the opponent in that case. Move allows players to move their Samurai token on the Dojo (board). Unsheath allows players to change their active Weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players will prepare their turn strategy simultaneously setting their 3 Action cards in the selected way, and then they will reveal their chosen actions one by one. When all 3 actions have been solved, if no player has their life track on zero (0) or below, the game continues. Players add the numbers in their actions to place the Reiki and Hearth tokens, which have special effects on the Dojo, and just start a brand new turn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a Samurai is defeated, having their life on zero (0) or below, the game ends! The Samurai who is still alive is the winner. Several games can be played in a row adding punctuations to enjoy a more complete experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
