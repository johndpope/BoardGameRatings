							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bouncers</name>
									
			<description>This game uses a standard deck of cards. The hearts are removed before starting; they form a pile with the top card visible. The other cards dealt out evenly, and then tricks are played. The winner of the trick takes the top card of the pile.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the deal players add the face value of all the numeral hearts they have won, and 11 for the Ace. However, each of the three Bouncers (Jack, Queen, King) entitles to discount  any one counter (numeral heart). However, if there are more Bouncers than counters, any Bouncer that cannot be use becomes a penalty in itself, and adds 25 points to the penalty score.&lt;br/&gt;The game end when somebody reaches 100 points; the winner is the player who has the fewest points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
