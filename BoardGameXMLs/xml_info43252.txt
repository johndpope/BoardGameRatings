			<description>From the box: &amp;quot;A game of chance and skill simulating lawn tennis&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In point of fact, chance definitely takes the upper hand over skill here: players try to position serves and returns but the outcome of every shot (and the players' positions on the court as well!) is determined by a set of 5 6-sided dice. The probability of winning a rally for either player stays pretty much the same regardless of his/her choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board, representing a tennis court with scoring tables, is quite neat though.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 playing board of two interlocking halves&lt;br/&gt;5 dice: &lt;br/&gt; - service (yellow)&lt;br/&gt; - in/out (white)&lt;br/&gt; - stroke (white)&lt;br/&gt; - singles position (light blue)&lt;br/&gt; - doubles position (green)&lt;br/&gt;4 purple scoring tokens&lt;br/&gt;1 purple player token (large)&lt;br/&gt;4 green scoring tokens&lt;br/&gt;1 green player token (large)&lt;br/&gt;1 yellow ball token&lt;br/&gt;1 set of rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Year of publication is unsure (not reported on rules booklet), but box features Boris Becker and Gabriela Sabatini in their prime, so late Eighties would be a reasonable guess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
