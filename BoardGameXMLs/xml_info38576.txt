			<description>&amp;ldquo;In 1241 the mighty Mongol army launched an invasion into Europe. While the main force headed for a showdown in Hungary a smaller army was sent into Poland as a diversion. A large Polish and Germany army, led by Henry the Pious of Silesia, marched off to link up with King Wenceslas of Bohemia's army. The Mongols confronted them as they passed the town of Liegnitz. Although outnumbered, the Mongols fought brilliantly and inflicted a devastating defeat on their opponents.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures mounted two per stand. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules.
