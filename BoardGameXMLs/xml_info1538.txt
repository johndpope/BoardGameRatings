			<description>As your life progresses (from 1-100, in a 'snakes/ladders' environment) you will need to have certain insurance to avoid major personal disasters. The one with the most of money after becoming 100 years old, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interesting mechanic is that you can buy all kinds of insurance that prevent disaster or bring you money. You cannot buy all of the insurances available though and you have to choose which insurance policies you buy at the beginning of the game. During the game calamities happen which cost money unless you have taken out the correct insurance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a promotion game, but it also has an educative purpose as you teaches what insurances are intended for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in celebration of the merger of two companies, namely &amp;quot;De Nederlanden van 1845&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Nationale Levensverzekering-Bank&amp;quot;, into &amp;quot;Nationale Nederlanden&amp;quot;. The company later also published Verzekeringsspel, a re-implementation, in remembrance of the 125-year anniversary of the company's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Verzekeringsspel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be aware: only Dutch versions exist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
