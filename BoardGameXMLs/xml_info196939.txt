							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shadows of Brimstone: Prospector Hero Pack</name>
									
			<description>Since before Dark Stone was even discovered in the hills around Brimstone, Prospectors were a common sight around town and out on the trails; mining in the hills and panning for gold in the streams and rivers. When the Dark Stone boom hit, their number multiplied... by the hour.  Prospectors from all around flooded the area, looking to get in on a piece of the action. Once the town exploded and the portals starting tearing open, most fled in terror. Those that didn&amp;rsquo;t either had nowhere to go or were too stubborn to let any creatures and demons from some other world steal their claim!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Prospector is a new Hero Class that can be added to your games of Shadows of Brimstone. He is a strong close combat fighter and can absorb a lot of damage before being KO&amp;rsquo;d. He also is the best around for collecting up Gold and Dark Stone, as his abilities allow him to earn double the amount found on most occasions.  His only real drawbacks are in having low Initiative and not being allowed to use Guns or Tech.  Includes Male and Female Prospector miniatures in high-detail resin, two 30mm plastic bases, Prospector Double-Sided Hero Character Sheet, Rulesheet, Prospector Upgrade Chart, Starting Upgrade Cards, and Starting Gear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
