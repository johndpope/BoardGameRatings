			<description>Submachine Network Exploration Experience (also known as SNEE, Subnet previously known as SubNet Exploration Project or SEP) was released on June 8, 2010 on Submachineworld.com with the first fifty locations. The original concept was that you would solve puzzles with an exploration team, but it has turned out to be just for exploration. The starting point for it is a laboratory unit, where a member of the exploration team stays. Mateusz Skutnik, who created the Submachine series, said that it will not be a game in the conventional sense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a post Mateusz Skutnik made in Pastel Forums, the forums of his and the Pastel Games team, he described Submachine Network Exploration Experience as huge where all of the locations of Submachine 4: The Lab and Submachine 5: The Root could be revisited, in addition to a few new locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On June 15, 2010, Submachine Network Exploration Experience had a major technical update. Mateusz Skutnik has redone the mechanics of location change in order to fix the loading problem when the game froze after loading new sets of rooms, also known as the black screen of death. He also advises players to use Firefox when playing the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On June 19, 2010, Submachine Network Exploration Experience had its first addendum. Mateusz Skutnik added 9 new locations to the game, bringing the total number of locations in the game from 51 to 60. From the 9 new locations, 8 locations are from Submachine 4, and one location is from Submachine 5. He also added three new theories to the game, bringing the total number of theories in the game from 21 to 24.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Submachine Wiki, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://submachine.wikia.com/wiki/Submachine_Network_Exploration_Experience&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://submachine.wikia.com/wiki/Submachine_Network_Explorat...&lt;/a&gt;;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
