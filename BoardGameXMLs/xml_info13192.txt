			<description>Varsity Gridiron Football is a stat based College Football Game that began as a basic &amp;quot;no frills&amp;quot; head to head or solitaire game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game now includes a first down chain &amp;quot;measurement option&amp;quot;, coffin corner kick and many other options to add a little spice and college football flavor.  The excellent solitaire option allows for an &amp;quot;auto defense&amp;quot; and really allows the player to enjoy the game!  The head to head version is also good going on the time tested tried and true &amp;quot;guess the play&amp;quot; system to give either the offense or defense control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QB's, WR's, RB's are all rated to fatigue to prevent overuse.  Team sheets are on good quality card stock rating team Offensive Line, Defensive Line, individual skill positions, individual kickers, punters, KR's and PR's.  All division 1A teams are carded and plenty of past seasons are available!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
