			<description>The sequel begins almost immediately after the first game ends, as Galamar and Valadorn (free from spell) must now fight off a demonic invasion headed by the demon Saeth. The brothers split up in their attempt to defend their land. They find out that the demons focus their attacks on several temples and are stealing mystical crystals. They finally arrive to face Saeth himself, only to find that he has used the crystals to activate an ancient weapon of great power - Heaven's Fury. Now the brothers must use whatever forces they have with them to defeat Saeth's army and the great demon himself before he is able to destroy the kingdom with the weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ancient Empires (mobile game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
