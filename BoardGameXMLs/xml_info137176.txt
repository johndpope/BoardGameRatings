			<description>The ultimate party game for family and friends, this game will have you foolin' around with your team mates no matter where you are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've got the friends over, dinner was great and the latest release DVD was equally good, but there's more to a great night with friends than a dinner and movie. What ever happened to fooling around and a good laugh - after all we use to do it all the time as kids?&lt;br/&gt;Foolin' Around is a great party game for entertaining guests and getting your friends (or family) to truly 'bond', so to speak.&lt;br/&gt;Test your impersonation, miming and balancing skills against your friends; discover how well you really know them; expose your talent for deception; find out if you are a truth or dare personality; and so much more...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whose going to score the most points? Are your friends up to it? How far are you prepared to go? With over 100 cards you'll find a huge variety of hilarious games you've never seen before plus some classics with our very own Foolin' Around twist!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With over 100 game cards to choose from, an evening of frank and fun discussion, true or false questions or something more boisterous using balloons, play tape, mimes or charades is sure to get your party going.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game has a saucy twist for you and your friends to laugh at - simply split yourselves into two groups to decide who still knows how to have a good time (just don't forget to keep score).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever the occasion, gathering around this hilarious adult game with a nice bottle of wine will make the most of your next party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Foolin&amp;rsquo; Around Party Game requires 6 or more players and includes a score pad, role of play tape, Foolin&amp;rsquo; Finger, sand timer, balloons, 110 choice question cards and playing guidelines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of play is to beat the other team. Use your wits, imagination and sheer determination to score the maximum points. Choose from Foolin&amp;rsquo; Around cards in six different categories: Messin&amp;rsquo;, Balloonin&amp;rsquo;, Mimin&amp;rsquo;, Guessin&amp;rsquo;, Blindfoldin&amp;rsquo; and Darin&amp;rsquo;. This game encourages fun with balloons, mimes and charades, thinking and observation, and fun in the dark.
