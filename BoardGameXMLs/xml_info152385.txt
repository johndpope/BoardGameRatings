			<description>Pochecko is a strategy board game that combines aspects of Poker and Chess. It is a 2-4 player game for ages 12+.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Pochecko, the players move markers around a board in order to claim poker cards and build a poker hand off of 1 of 2 community cards.  As a counter maneuver, players may instead move one of the community blockers in order to block opponents from claiming the hand they are going for. The player with the best 5 card poker hand at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
