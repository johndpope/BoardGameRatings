							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zotty: Rate Zoo</name>
									
			<description>An animal-themed guessing game for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns drawing a face-down animal card from a stack. Only one player gets to see which animal it is. All the other players take turns asking a yes/no question, trying to find out what animal it is. If a player thinks he/she knows what animal it is, they name  it on their turn. If it is correct, they win the card. After each question, the Zotty pawn is moved one space. If Zotty reaches the end of the track (= after twelve questions) before the animal has been guessed, nobody wins the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after a number of rounds (to be agreed upon by the players at the start of the game) has been played. The player with the most cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
