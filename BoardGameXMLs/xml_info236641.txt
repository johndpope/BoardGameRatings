							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Features and Conditions for Describing Books</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will often come across books during their adventures. In some settings and systems, books play an important role in the plot. In most, they are at the very least a source of knowledge, clues and value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although many books may share the same general appearance, especially if they were all produced at the same time, in order to make some stand out, or provide extra clues or information, there may be specific features that differ between copies. These can be as simple as appearance to such as potentially useful notes written in them or being a more unusual copy than normal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the conditions and features described are suitable for a modern setting, and many are suitable for older ones. Some involve such as dust jackets, which are a more modern book component and which wouldn't be found in medieval times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lacunose - Most often seen in older manuscripts, and especially in palimpsests, the text has lacuna, where there is a gap, from a word to a sentence to a paragraph or even more, where the words are missing or illegible. Sometimes done deliberately, to get the reader to fill in the gaps, but can be due to weathering or other damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the cover and one page the front matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
