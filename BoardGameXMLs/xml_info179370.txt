			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commune With Exotic and Powerful Spirits&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one knows better than shamans the importance of knowing the right spirit. This class, first introduced in the Advanced Class Guide, communes with spirits on a daily basis, gaining strange and otherworldly powers, as well as access to new and unknown spells, depending on what spirit they choose to commune with. As a result, those shamans who are able to make contact with more spirits have a distinct advantage over those limited to the same spirits known to all shamans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s where this book comes in. Inside, you&amp;rsquo;ll find three brand new shaman spirits, including the ravages spirit, the rest spirit, and the time spirit. Hateful and venomous things, ravages spirits are embodiments of pestilence, poison, and decay in all things. Use their power to enhance and create poisons and diseases, and to level powerful curses upon your enemies. By contrast, spirits of rest are jolly and agreeable things, that bring comfort and respite. Use them to put your foes to sleep, or to ensure that your party recovers fully from the wounds and fatigue of battle. Finally, the elusive and mysterious time spirits allow shamans to speed themselves and their allies, slow their foes, and even make quick trips through time, including summoning their future self to fight by their side!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
