			<description>Martial Champion (マーシャルチャンピオン?) is a 1993 fighting game released for the arcades by Konami. It was Konami's third fighting game after the 1985 releases Yie Ar Kung-Fu and Galactic Warriors, and their first release that came after the success of Capcom's 1991 arcade hit Street Fighter II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Martial Champion follows the same fighting game conventions established by Street Fighter II: the player's character fights against his or her opponent in best two-out-of-three matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player. The player has a character roster of ten fighters to choose from, each with their own unique fighting style and special techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The control layout differs from Street Fighter II and most typical fighting games inspired by Street Fighter II. Martial Champion's control system is derived from the control system of Yie Ar Kung-Fu, but simplified to simply high, medium and low attacks, instead of having to press an attack button and a direction. One unique feature this arcade game has is stages that are similar to the &amp;quot;high-jump&amp;quot; stages seen in Capcom's later fighting games such as X-Men vs. Street Fighter. Another unique feature is that certain characters carry weapons which can be disarmed by their opponent and used against them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Martial Champion&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
