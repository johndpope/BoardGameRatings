			<description>Wij zijn... (&amp;quot;We are...&amp;quot;) is a card game consisting of 56 cards (5 cards with rules and the rest have positive words on them; one per card). The game can be played in two ways. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Either as a Simon Says game in which players in turn play a card and declare to whom they ascribe the positive ability. Every player in turn has to repeat all cards played before they can play a card themselves. &lt;br/&gt;     Or it can be played as a meta game over a period of time in which you need to say your own positive words and at the end you want some players to guess your words but not all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
