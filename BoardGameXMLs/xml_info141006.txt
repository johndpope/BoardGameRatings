							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Triple Crown</name>
									
			<description>Triple Crown is a trick taking game for 4 players that can be played with a regular deck of cards. Players play individually, but temporary alliances with occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three possible ways to score points. Which of these three goals you need to achieve is determined by the cards you are dealt. The player who is dealt the Ace of Spades will be trying to win 5 tricks playing alone. He/she is known as the High player. The player who is dealt the Two of Diamonds also plays alone and will be trying to go nil (lose every trick). He/she is known as the Low player. The two players who were dealt neither the Ace of Spades nor the Two of Diamonds are on a team for the hand. The team players will score points by preventing the High and Low players from achieving their goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you are the High player, Low player, or on the Team will be secret at the beginning of the hand. What goal you are trying to achieve is only revealed through play. Therefore keep a poker face and play smart. Be quiet and unreadable or loud and deceiving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a fun and exciting game for all skill levels. Easy to learn rules and play for beginners. Plenty of strategic depth for more experienced players to master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
