			<description>Agassi Tennis Generation is a tennis sports game, developed by Aqua Pacific and published by DreamCatcher Interactive for the PlayStation 2 and Game Boy Advance. It was released on August 25, 2003 in North America and November 28, 2003 in Europe. The game features former tennis player Andre Agassi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the PlayStation 2 version, the game features 16 tournaments and 12 courts. It has various court surfaces and three game modes: Quick Match, Arcade and Championship. There are 32 tennis players with varying abilities in speed, strength, and stamina. Championship offers players 10,000 dollars and a number of choices in which to spend it on, e.g. coaches, personal trainers, talent agents etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each individual can help improve an athlete's abilities in specific areas over time. Quick Match drops players onto a court for a single match, while Arcade is designed to offer players a more simplified control scheme. Tournament has players competing against a series of fictitious opponents on each of the 12 courts to win prize money. The PlayStation 2 version of the game features motion-capture animation from Agassi himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Game Boy Advance version, there are four modes: Quick Match, Arcade, Championship, and Multiplayer Multipack, which requires a link cable, another Game Boy Advance, and another copy of the game. Gamers choose from ten tennis player characters to compete in both single and double matches in courts set in the UK, France, Germany, Australia, Italy and the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Agassi Tennis Generation&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
