							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Princess Provocateur</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since ancient times, demonic overlords and megalomaniacal wizards have kidnapped princesses to further their nefarious plots, hiding them away in trapped towers, mysterious mazes,&lt;br/&gt;or dangerous dungeons. When all hope seemed lost, a hero would appear to defeat the villain and win glory, wealth, and the heart of the princess...it was tradition, after all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, you know what? Tradition stinks. Here you are, stuck in a dank cell with a few other princesses, sitting on moldy straw in cold, unsanitary conditions, awaiting some foolhardy,&lt;br/&gt;so-called &amp;ldquo;hero,&amp;rdquo; who for all you know may already by dead! Besides which, you and the other princesses aren&amp;rsquo;t so keen on being treated as a prize.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You aren&amp;rsquo;t the princesses of yore &amp;ndash; each of you is capable in your own right. You don&amp;rsquo;t need a hero to save the day. Most of these guards look like pushovers, anyway. If a barbarian, a kid with a funny hat, or a pair of mustachioed plumbers can defeat a villain, why can&amp;rsquo;t a bunch of princesses who have been schooled in fencing, problem-solving, and leadership?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time to kick tradition in the butt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using mechanics similar to Heist, this game turns fairy tales on their ear, as not-so-helpless princesses tell the story of how they escaped the clutches of the villain-of-the-week, all whilst avoiding the irritating and domineering hero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
