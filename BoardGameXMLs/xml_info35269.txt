							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Have Chariot Will Race</name>
									
			<description>These rules allow quick and fun chariot racing involving two or more chariots. Historically the Romans usually raced 4, 8 or 12 chariots.&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls one or more units. A unit can be a chariot OR a driver that survived a crashed chariot.&lt;br/&gt;During a turn each player moves their unit one at a time in the following order decided by track position: The current race leading unit moves first each turn. If more than 1 unit is in the same row, then dice to decide the order of movement for the units in that row.  Highest roll wins; re-rolling ties. If the leading chariot has crashed and the driver survived, it is still considered the leading unit until overtaken by another chariot or driver. The next to move is the unit in the next closest row (not lane), and so on.  Dice for units in the same row as above. If a unit has been lapped, its physical position on the track behind the race leader at the start of that turn counts for movement order, not the number of laps completed. &lt;br/&gt;Crashed chariots do not move voluntarily, but may move as the outcome of a collision (see COLLISIONS). Collisions are resolved at the time they occur and any outcome moves applied, before a unit completes a move. For curves, determine the unit in front by comparing front lines of each space when extended sideways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
