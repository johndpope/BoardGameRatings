			<description>Excerpt from the RPG:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE OLD AGE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very little is remembered of the Empires that existed in the Old Age. The cities seemed to stretch on eternally and their spires touched the heavens. Those who are old enough to speak of these cities weep silently, remembering the atrocities that lead to their downfall. Some still dream about the blinding light that changed the world forever, while others whisper about the dark shadows that seem to exist in the ruins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE CURRENT WAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The remnants of society still exist, broken and shattered in unimaginable ways. Those who survived the apocalypse were forever changed by their surroundings, becoming twisted versions of their former selves. Underground shelters and caves turned their inhabitants into dark and stout creatures; while the deep forests created pale and spindly ones. Rumors persist of enclaves of surface dwellers, relatively unchanged by the blight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
