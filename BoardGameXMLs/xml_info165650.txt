			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shipwrecked and lost at sea, the party receives unexpected recue from a Pirate Ship and its scurvy crew. Invited to join the crew in their wacky adventures, the Party quickly discovers that these pirates are nothing but posers! Adrift with wannabe pirates, and only a Barrel of gherkins for food, the party seems destined for Davey Jones&amp;rsquo; Locker! When all seems lost, salvation arrives in the form of a military vessel! Unfortunately, that same vessel is on its way to destroy the goblin capital. Can the heroes stop this massacre with only a bunch of farmers and shepherds at their side, or will the heroes try to stop the genocidal military by themselves? Either way, it looks like they&amp;rsquo;re in a real &amp;quot;pickle&amp;quot; now!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Episode 23 - The Gherkin Pirates&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: With Talk Like a Pirate Day coming up, the Gagmen are in a pickle of a situation to put out a pirate adventure. Special guest Brandon McFadden of the Tiny Dungeon Kickstarter helps out, and pickles all around. Learn lessons like, genocide is impolite and cannibalism can be funny. Set sail and start swabbing the poop deck, because it is going to get thick on this adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
