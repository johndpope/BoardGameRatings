			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a three scenario war game in Hires graphics with sound.  It is not merely the conversion of a board game to computer, nor are your pieces represented by lifeless text characters.  It may be played by two persons and takes about 8 hours to complete.  The rules are simple enough that you won't have to spend several days reading your manual before you can play.  It contains 2 world maps and a fairly detailed map of the Iran-Iraq battlefield.  All scoring, animation, and positions are handled by the computer - no separate tablets to fool with.  Moves are input by both players in series of 3 and when the space bar is pressed the battle becomes animated.  A must see to believe...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
