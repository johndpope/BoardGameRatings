							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bushido: Misao, the Grey Rose</name>
									
			<description>Little is known of what becomes of the Roses of Jima when their beauty fades and bodies lose the firmness of youth. Some think they fade away, relinquishing their veils and their old identity and choosing a new one. Misao, the grey rose is a powerful member of the Jade Rose gumi, for the old rose&amp;rsquo;s eyes see far more than those around her. It is told in hushed rumour that she can see into the future, knowing the actions of men before they have even realised themselves. To anger or harm her is as foolish and unlucky as slurring the five themselves. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
