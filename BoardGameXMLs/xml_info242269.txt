			<description>&amp;ldquo;When I grow up, I want to be&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; This has been said, is said and will be said by children everywhere. There is a time when a child starts to discover the various professions and by the influence of a familiar or by the influence of some book or movie, she will identify herself with some kind of activity that she wants to do when she grows up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quando for grande QUERO SER&amp;hellip; is a board game for 2 to 5 players, with ages of 5 and up. For this game 10 professions where chosen, those usually chosen by kids when completing the phrase. Those professions are: a Pilot, a Fireman, a Chef, a Police Officer, an Astronaut, an Engineer, a Mechanic, a Doctor, a Soldier and a Farmer. Some are represented by a female drawing and others by a male drawing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to put together the various profession drawings that are composed of 3 parts: Head, torso and feet. The players need to have skill, attention and a bit of luck in order to gather on the board the three parts that are needed to complete each profession drawing. Besides the different drawings, the background color for each profession is also different in order to help the younger players to identify each of the parts for each of the professions so they can easily put together the complete set.&lt;br/&gt;The winner will be the one who can complete the most profession drawings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
