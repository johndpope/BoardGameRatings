							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Antony&#039;s Retreat from Parthia: 36 BC</name>
									
			<description>In 36BC the Roman world was divided between Octavian and Antony. Octavian's legions were training for the inevitable clash by campaigning on the Rhine, and Antony needed a campaign to get his forces, living in the luxury of the East, in top shape. Political turmoil in Parthia suggested easy pickings, together with an opportunity to avenge Crassus' famous defeat in 55BC. Antony therefore assembled an army of eighty thousand men, including Armenian allies of dubious loyalty, and late in the campaigning season he set off through Armenia to attack the Parthian capital at Ecbatana, The first objective was Phraata, a Median city which must be captured to maintain communications with Armenia. Here Antony halted to wait for his siege train to catch up. Unfortunately, it never arrived. A Parthian army under the command of Monaeses ambushed and destroyed the train, and at this point the Armenians deserted en masse. Antony was now left in the middle of Media, with no siege train and his communications cut, and one quarter of his army already lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 players game on the disastrous retreat of Antony's army from Parthia in 36 BC. Published in Slingshot magazine # 123.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
