			<description>Shoot your way to the top of the leader boards in BalliesShoot, a free game based on classic arcade shooters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ballies are attacking and it's up to you to take them down! Use your own monster Ballie to get back at them, then catch all of the yummy fruit for massive points. But watch out, because all Ballies take different amounts of shots to destroy, can swoop down on you, or shoot back!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Move your Ballie left or right then watch as the fruit rains down. Catch special items and unlock powerful power-ups such as a three-way shot, a laser shot, exploding bombs, and more. Get through all 30 levels, including bonus point levels, and then take on the biggest Ballie of them all! It's a simple and fun shooter for the whole family to enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
