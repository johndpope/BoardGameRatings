							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Anatomists</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever thought that your dungeon exploration needs more mad science?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter the Anatomist, a class of characters dedicated to the practice of Medicine. Through their own skill and knowledge, they are capable of performing wonders of science that can compete with any magic. Stitching together new life-froms, re-animating the dead with a bolt of lightning, grafting pulsating new organs onto their patients and repairing even the most horrific injuries are this class's stock-in-trade, and they can frequently be found acompanying adventurers in search of new specimens and opertunities to experiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This class is broadly compatible with pretty much all OSR games, although it was written with basic-derived games in mind. It will fit best into those campaigns with a weird or gothic flavour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
