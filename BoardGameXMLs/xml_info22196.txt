			<description>Although the Milton Bradley logo appears prominently on the box, this is apparently a self-published or prototype game.  No copyright or authorship information is included with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The materials are hand-made.  The box looks like a standard gift box with artwork pasted on.  The box insert and game base are constructed of foam board; the building pieces are thin, hand-painted wood or fiberboard.  There are three kinds of slats, all parallelograms.  Large red slats are notched at the end, large green slats at the ends and sides, and smaller yellow slats are notched at the corners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Per the instructions, three slats are inserted in slots in the foam base and then the players take turns building a structure, adding slats by mating the notches.  If the structure falls or bends enough to touch the table anywhere but the base, the last player loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The notches are inconsistently cut, so it's nearly impossible to play - sometimes you can't get the pieces together, and sometimes they fit too loose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
