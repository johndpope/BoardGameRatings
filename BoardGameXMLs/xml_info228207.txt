			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SPARKUP is a card game for 1-10 players that turns everyday people into entrepreneurs. Get inspired with new ideas. Pitch your invention. Vote for your favorite. From outrageous to ingenious, ignite the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SPARKUP can be played as a party game for many people or as more of a brain game for 1-2 players. The game not only entertains but also can inspire those who play to come up with great ideas. It's game that goes beyond the game itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In just 20-30 minutes, players get the chance to become inventors and entrepreneurs as they are guided through an idea generation phase where they come up with a new idea. The entire game plays in 5 phases through a series of &amp;quot;minute to win it&amp;quot; challenges. This keeps everyone engaged and creating at the same time. When the time's up, each team takes turns pitching their ideas to the group. We're always amazed at what incredible things people can come up with given a little spark and a time limit. Next, each team secretly votes for the idea they like best. In the end, votes are revealed and one team is declared winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
