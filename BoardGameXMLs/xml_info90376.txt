			<description>From the publisher: Kynstrin &amp;ouml;ll is a fun and different trivia game with interesting and funny questions. The game will start rowdy discussions between players on just about everything concerning the interaction between males and females and sexual issues. Interesting information about issues anyone should know is dispersed all through the game. This game is the first one of it's kind in Iceland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll a die which indicates from which of the five categories their next question will be. The goal is to be the first to answer correctly a question from all of the five categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
