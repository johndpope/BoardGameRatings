							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SiN</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;SiN is a computer game first-person shooter based on a modified version of the Quake II engine developed by Ritual Entertainment and published by Activision in late 1998.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in the near future of 2037, many of the levels and locations are reminiscent of their current day equivalents. Banks, building sites, sewage works and other everyday recognisable buildings form the basis of many of the levels in SiN. One major difference in the world of SiN is the lack of a police force. 10 years prior to the game, it is revealed that the police force collapsed due to inefficiency and ineffectiveness against the rising tide of crime. Private security companies have taken their place, some patrolling the streets like the former police, some in charge of protecting their employer's assets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of these companies which employ their own armed security forces are SiNtek, a large multi-national biotechnology firm owned by the beautiful and charismatic Elexis Sinclaire. Elexis took over the firm following the disappearance of her father, Dr. Thrall Sinclaire, who formed it in 2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The protagonist of the game, Col. John Blade, is the commander of one of the largest security forces in the city of Freeport, HardCorps. Prior to the beginning of the game, John is working to rid the streets of a potent new recreational drug named U4, which is gaining in popularity in Freeport. Yet, the source of the drug is still unknown, and its effects not entirely studied. As the game begins, the player is placed into the shoes of John Blade as he responds to a full scale bank heist and hostage situation perpetrated by a well known criminal, Mancini. But as the player progresses and pursues the criminals behind the heist, further questions are raised: Who is really behind the heist? And is this linked to the reported appearance of mutants in the city?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the missions, Blade is aided via radio link by a computer cracker working at HardCorps, JC. JC is a skilled cracker, capable of breaking into even the tightest of networks. In fact, Blade first found out about JC when investigating a cracker who had broken into the HardCorps system. After tracking down the hacker, Blade, recognizing the perpetrator's talents, decided to make him a job offer at HardCorps instead of arresting him. Thus, JC became one of HardCorps most valuable assets.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, SiN (video game) , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
