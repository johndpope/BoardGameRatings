			<description>Savage Roleplaying in the Hyperviolent Future&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world has changed. It's become dark. Dangerous. Terrifying. Even more than you ever thought it could be. And it all started four years ago with the arrival of the Prometheus Mark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One day, inexplicably, tens of thousands of people around the world woke up with a dark symbol seemingly gouged into their foreheads. Those cursed with what was dubbed the Prometheus Mark would shift dramatically from being either hyper-intellectual or unfathomably strong and powerful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, not long after the marks first appeared, certain &amp;quot;marked&amp;quot; individuals would unpredictably commit heinous acts of ultraviolence as their eyes clouded over and their pupils became strangely pentagonal,without warning or provocation. Others would inexplicably slip into an unresponsive, vegetative state, making themselves easy prey for the savages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the marked are able to keep their extreme behaviours in check, while many are now hunted by large sectors civilised society. It is a harsh, difficult life for a marked person in a world that hates you. Most live together in &amp;quot;packs&amp;quot; to stay safe and keep their urges in balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are one of the marked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And it ain't for the faint of heart...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
