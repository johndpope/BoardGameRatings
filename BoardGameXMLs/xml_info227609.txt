							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Three Little Kittens</name>
									
			<description>A player begins by spinning four and then chooses one of the two identical paths to move on.  &lt;br/&gt;Along the paths are spaces which are numbered.  If a player lands on one of these spaces they must return to the numbered space before it.   There are also white spaces to be found along the path.  A player landing on any of these spaces loses two turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The black space at the end of the game is where the kittens find their mittens and wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
