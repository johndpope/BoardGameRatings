							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tales of Gargentihr</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Real Fantasy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1492 two continents met and the humans known as Karro first sighted the New World. In the villages there they met a simple and peaceful people who greeted them as gods. From these bases the Karro explored and claimed their New Republic of Gevuria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is now 1585 and the Ha&amp;rsquo;esh villages have grown into pollution filled Karro towns; the Ha&amp;rsquo;esh relegated to second class citizens in their own land. The new Institutes of the Karro collide head on with the old guard of the Chuch, whilst the bordering realms of Khos-Tavar and Ja&amp;rsquo;Hall look on with growing apprehension at their swiftly expanding neighbour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Into this turmoil come the Clondis, a secret society of adventurers from all walks of life; grizzled streetmen from the back alleys of Rol Katel, educated society men from the mighty capital of Treth and noble Channi, the holy warriors of the Ha&amp;rsquo;esh. The Clondis accept any who are bold enough into its ranks and turn away no task that it deems worthy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tales of Gargentihr&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gargentihr is a world far different from our own. The continents drift upon endless seas of silt whilst Sa-energy crackles overhead in the blackened skies. The continent of Agasha lies before you, awaiting discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gargentihr is a world both ancient and new. The Insitute of New Science explores the frontiers of technology, whilst the secret powers of the Ancients reign within the dark corners of Agasha. Man stands on the brink of a glorious new age of knowledge, but many would block his progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This strange world is finely detailed throughout the rules and plunges the players into an alien landscape ripe for exploration.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
