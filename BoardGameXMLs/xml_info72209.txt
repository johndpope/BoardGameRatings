			<description>French Kings Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oblong pennyprint with/of a board game, that is similar to the Game of Goose. There are 63 spaces, which depict kings and emperors of France from the year 420 to 1859, and eagles. In the middle is a larger picture of the 'Famille Imp&amp;eacute;riale' (Emperor Napoleon III, emperor from 1852-1870, with wife and son). Title and Rules of the Game are in Dutch, the text with the pictures is in French. In the four corners there are pictures of acts of war with the subscripts 'En Afrique'; 'En Crim&amp;eacute;e'; 'En Italie'; 'En Chine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rule of the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is played with two dice and goes from 1 to 63. Everyone throws [the dice] in turn, and puts something on the place that his number of pips indicates, with the second throw you move the number of spaces indicated by the number of pips in the throw, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever lands on number 63, the imperial family, wins the game and gets the pot. Before the start of the game, everyone agrees on an amount to put in the pot, and what the fines will be that have to be payed at every 'hinderpaal' (obstacle) or 'ontmoeting' (encounter) that either hinders progress or makes you change places, for example, if you throw 6, you pay a fine and go to 12.&lt;br/&gt;If you land on 19, you are resting in the hotel, you pay the fine that was predetermined and you have to pass for 1 turn.&lt;br/&gt;If you land on 31, where St.Louis is taken prisoner of war, you pay the fine and have to stay in the space until someone else is taken in your place.&lt;br/&gt;If you land on 42, you are in the imperial garden, you pay the fine and go back to 39 (it may say 30, I can't tell).&lt;br/&gt;If you land on 52, where the iron mask is in prison, you have to pay [the fine] and stay there until you are released again.&lt;br/&gt;If you land on 58, Napoleon II at Solferino, you have to pay [the fine] and start from the beginning (written is '= 24 june 1859').&lt;br/&gt;Whoever is passed by another player, has to pay and go to that players number.&lt;br/&gt;Whoever throws a 6 and 3 at the start of the game, goes to 26 the trophee, and whoever throws 5 and 4, goes to 53, the crown (not sure if I see the numbers right).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you land on an eagle, you go forward again the number of pips you threw on the dice (this will happen again if you land on another eagle). If you would pass 63 this way, you count back so many spaces as you have movement left over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
