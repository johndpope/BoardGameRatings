			<description>&amp;quot;There's never been anything like this crossword puzzle game!&amp;quot;  That seems likely...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of three large sheets of paper, with each four different crossword puzzles on each side of each sheet.  Two to four (as two teams) players work the puzzle on their side of the square sheet for three minutes, each with their own colored pencil.  When time is up, the sheet is rotated 90 degrees, the timer is reset, and the players work the new (to them) puzzle now on their side.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;You keep adding letters and/or correcting mistakes, then rotating every three minutes until the puzzles are completed or everyone gives up.  You get points for correct letters you've added, and you subtract points for errors noted by your opponents.  The colored pencils allow end-of-game scoring and adjudication of the puzzles.  Answers are provided in sealed envelopes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seems like it would be fun, but you'd really have to love crosswords - working them with time pressure is sweet misery.  Six games can be played by four players with the supplied puzzles.  Refill puzzles were available in 1985 using the handy order form, but good luck now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
