			<description>In this game for children, you need to move pawns into the holes with the corresponding shapes and earn the most victory tokens this way.&lt;br/&gt;  Contents:&lt;br/&gt; 1 gameboard&lt;br/&gt; 12 pawns (in 4 different color red, green, blue,yellow, and 3 different shape triangle, brick, roll in every color)&lt;br/&gt; 12 victory tokens&lt;br/&gt; 4 color tokens (in 4 different colors)&lt;br/&gt; 3 shape tokens&lt;br/&gt; 2 dice&lt;br/&gt;  When it's your turn, you need to take a step with a pawn. The goal is moving a pawn into a field having a hole with the same shape. When this occurs you can get a victory token. To take a step with a pawn, you need to roll with 2 dice. The first die identifies the number of steps, the second die identifies the color, so if you roll green and 2 you have to take 2 steps with one of the green pawns.&lt;br/&gt;  If you roll a star with the color die, you need to select a color token from the face-down pile and a shape token also from the face-down pile and these identify which pawn you must move.&lt;br/&gt;  The game ends when all pawns fell down in the holes.&lt;br/&gt; The player with the most victory tokens wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
