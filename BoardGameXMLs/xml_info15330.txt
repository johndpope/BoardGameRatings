							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kogepunkt</name>
									
			<description>Kogepunkt is a trivia game focused on the theme of food, in which up to 4 teams of players can attempt to become the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team takes a token and places on the starting point on the board.  On their turn, they roll a die and move their token by its result.  They then have to draw a card and answer a question (asked by another team) about the category they landed on.  Categories include utensils, drinks, ingredients, background of certain foods, and miscellanous questions.  Correct answers (and moving their token a complete circle around the game track) awards the team a Chef Hat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a team manages to obtain a pre-agreed number of Hats, thus making them the winners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
