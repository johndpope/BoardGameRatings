			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death and famine overshadow the land as the evil powers of darkness grow in strength and cunning. In a moment of carelessness you have allowed the evil magician Mordread to cast you down into the haunted maze of dungeons beneath his dark and forboding castle.&lt;br/&gt;He has transformed you into a magical key to roam for eternity through the haunted labyrinths below ground, whilst he enslaves all those who live above.&lt;br/&gt;Were it not for the fact that you are possibly the greatest wizard in the land you would surely be doomed; but as you cast your mind back over centuries of spellbinding you suddenly remember a solution to your predicament; a solution in theory, yes, but can you carry it out in practice?&lt;br/&gt;There are four sets of different coloured doors, all of which must be opened before you can gain freedom, and all the time you are at the mercy of hoards of ghosts and ghouls intent on hampering your progress. At the entrance to the maze there are four coloured keys; the colours corresponding to those of the doors. Your must pass through one of these keys to become the same colour, and only then can you open the corresponding doors.&lt;br/&gt;Once all the doors of one colour have been opened you must return to the entrance, pass through another key to change colour, and then attack another set of doors. This process must be repeated until all the doors have been opened and you are able to gain freedom, but the closer you come to liberty the more frantic Mordreads hoards become in their attempts to thwart you. You must escape from this dank, evil place, so that you can repel the forces of darkness and bring light and livery to the land once again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Chris Lancaster&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
