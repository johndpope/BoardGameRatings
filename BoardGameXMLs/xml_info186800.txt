							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Osprey: Open Source Paper Roleplaying Engine Y</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Osprey is a generic, universal role-playing engine (system) released under a GNU license; it is free.  The game was intended to serve as a toolkit for building other games but does stand alone as a fully playable system.  Characters have general characteristics (name, background), Attributes (Body, Intelligence, Will, Dexterity, Social), Skills, Advantages/Disadvantages, and (optionally) Powers.  Attributes yield a dice pool, Skills implement the pool of the Attribute they are based on.  Powers represent things like super-powers and are used only in some genres.  Task resolution matches a dice pool roll against a Difficult Target selected by the GM, or against the dice pool roll of an opponent.  In combat, an Attack Skill generally is opposed by a Defense Skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note - there are (minor) textual differences between the HTML Version and the other (PDF/LaTeX) Versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
