			<description>Supply Line is a 4X game which attempts to simulate and demonstrate the logistics problems of traditional ground warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suitable for 2 to 12 players, aged 14+, who have 90-240 minutes spare to enjoy a 4X game of logistical battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game involves developing and maintaining a network of goods (fuel and metal is extracted from wells and mines) and military units which are built both to protect one's own network and also to attack opponent networks and sometimes even sieze them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What makes this game significantly different to many other war games is that it concentrates upon maintaining a supply line at all times. Units that are cut off from headquarters ('the fortress') are disabled and destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player resigns or cannot pay off their debt at the beginning of a round - the remaining players are ranked based upon the size of their territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to crayon-based games, Supply Line uses whiteboard markers to represent the network growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game starts with players concurrently developing their home area - this is quite fast, and takes about 30 minutes. Once basic networks have been developed, the game moves into turn-based rounds which concentrate on expansion, defence, and attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
