			<description>From the cover -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planes are infinite in their mysteries and their peoples, bringing a vast amount of diversity across the multiverse. Why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t the same hold true for planetouched player races? The standard Aasimars and Tieflings are an excellent option for players who are seeking to create a character with an exotic flare or a touch of the planes within their blood but why stop there? The other core races, whether they are Elves, Gnomes, Halflings, Orcs, Humans, or Dwarves, have all made expeditions to other planes&amp;hellip;surely their curiosity attracted the attention of planar denizens?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Children of the Planes, a racial sourcebook that introduces new planetouched races to your game. This sourcebook brings twelve new races to life with new feats and prestige classes. Unlike the Aasimars and Tieflings whose otherworldly influences are undefined, the new races found in this book have specific outsiders in their heritage. Whether it is a beautiful Korali seductress or a malicious Skinx prankster, Children of the Planes provides a variety of new racial options for GMs and players alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
