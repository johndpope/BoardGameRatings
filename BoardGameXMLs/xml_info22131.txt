							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Muldoon Game</name>
									
			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;The MULDOON Game is for those who want to get away from the ordinary party chit chat; who want to let themselves go; and who want to gain a greater insight into the true personalities of those around them. So when you play the MULDOON game, sit down, relax, be honest to yourself...you'll have more fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;MULDOON: A person who is playing the MULDOON game. He remains a MULDOON until he reveals his identity to those playing the game with him.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;NOODLUM: A group of MULDOONS playing the MULDOON game. An ideal NOODLUM connsists of 6 to 12 MULDOONS.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A leader is chosen, each other player is given a sheet from the MULDOON pad. The leader then draws 10 question cards and reads them to the group. Players answer anonymously the questions. The leader will, then, read the answers. Players try to identify of the author of the answers, each correct guess is given 1 point. The winner is the player with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
