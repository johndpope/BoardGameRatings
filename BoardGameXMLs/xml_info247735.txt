			<description>Outsmart is the fun and fast-paced family game featuring creative, engaging questions that all have multiple correct answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing Outsmart is simple:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone takes an answer sheet; the dice is rolled to determine the number of answers required; a topic teaser and one question are read aloud; then players write answers to try and Outsmart their opponents by giving the most correct answers each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trick to Outsmart is choosing between more popular and less obvious answers and then trying to say them, in turn, before other players do; since only original answers count.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outsmart is knowledge, strategy, timing, luck and lots of humour all rolled into one.  And every Outsmart game you play is fun and truly unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
