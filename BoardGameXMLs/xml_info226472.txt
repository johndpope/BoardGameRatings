			<description>From the designer's notes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I like ghosts and ghost stories. I thought of this game after I played &amp;ldquo;Old Friends&amp;rdquo; by Jason Morningstar and Ole Peder Giaever at Fastaval. It&amp;rsquo;s a mix of a s&amp;eacute;ance, the myth of Orpheus and Euridice, and a murderous ghost story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a judges description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Walk Among the Dead is a freeform game about questioning the dead. Players take turns wearing a mask and risking their life to find closure with the one they lost while the others play [mostly] truthful ghosts whispering back. The game accommodates various group sizes and range of potential stories while maintaining focus on its premise and giving players clear instructions about what they should be doing. - Marshall Miller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was a finalist in the 200 Word RPG Challenge 2016&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
