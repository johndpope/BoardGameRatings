			<description>Two street gangs both alike in dignity, &lt;br/&gt;In West Manhattan, where we lay our scene, &lt;br/&gt;Do battle for their turf with pirouettes,&lt;br/&gt;Leaping, spinning, fighting the Sharks and Jets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a tactical combat game based on the musical West Side Story. Players control rival street gangs, The Sharks and The Jets, that are represented by individual counters. Gang members attack by snapping their fingers, singing and performing dance moves. They attempt to break the other gang's cool. Each character has a cool and uncool side. Leaders can rally uncool gang members. All combat is resolved on the Choreography Results Table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
