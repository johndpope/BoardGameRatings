			<description>The game is intended to develop the child's imagination by creating associative connections between each pair of pictures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are divided equally among the players, face down.  Each player then, turns up his cards to the pictorial side. The players decide who will be the first.  The latter places one of his cards at the centre of the table, and the next player is to attach to this card another one with an associative connection with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
