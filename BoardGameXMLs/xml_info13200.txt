							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vox Pop</name>
									
			<description>Vox Pop is a quiz game based on a popular man-on-the-street interview radio program. Players answer general knowledge questions according to a random draw. Players decide on the victory conditions before the start of play. Two versions were released.  The original cover shows a yellow lightning bolt on a blue field.  The second (called The New Vox Pop, but only on the question cards inside) features a New York skyline and hosts Parks Johnson and Wally Butterworth on the cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
