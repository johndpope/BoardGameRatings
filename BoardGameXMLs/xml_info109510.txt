							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood of Dionysus</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Blood of Dionysus&amp;quot; is a short adventure for the Swing role-playing game (conversion notes for the d20 system comes as a separate Appendix). An ancient jar filled with the divine wine of the Greek god of wine appears throughout the city, causing people to give into their basest impulses. The characters must track down the jar and somehow neutralize it before the city goes completely insane. However, a powerful wine patron believes the wine can cure his physical disabilities and stops at nothing to get that jar for himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure assumes the characters already possess a little bit of experience with supernatural occurrences as well as with physical danger. The adventure favors characters with connections with law enforcement, not only to obtain essential information, but because their opponents work in a dangerous and violent criminal underworld.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure takes place in a generic metropolis, simply called the City, about the size of San Francisco, which has a population of 750,000 (according to a 2003 estimate), so under normal circumstances, the city has a WILL Rating of 7. However, the divine wine has relaxed perceptions lowering the WILL Rating to 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
