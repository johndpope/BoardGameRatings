			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This tale takes place in Birkville, a small town within the Nedrasi Forest that lies along both the River Naga and the King's Road (thereby seeing enough traveling folk to make it slightly noteworthy). The nearest city is Severan, located several days journey west by horse. The local Lord (Nellis) rules the city and its surrounding lands, although he's usually only heard from when he sends one of his officers to gather up Birkville's men for military service. Typically this consists of just a show of military force to another Lord or for some type of patrolling duty, but rarely men from the village are killed in battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
