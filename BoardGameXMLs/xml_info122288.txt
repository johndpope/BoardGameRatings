			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a new collectible RPG in a Golden Age Superheroes vein: to play, you just need any set of the playbooks, with at least one per player. Each playbook gives you a pre-made character and all the rules needed to play them or to run the game for others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exclusive story: the Secret Origin of...Dynama!&lt;br/&gt;Barbara Briggs, injured by a bomb planted in the bank where she works on the day it was the target of a heist. Thought to be beyond saving, but the visionary work of one scientist granted her an amazing atomic heart that is the source of her stunning powers! Now, she has sworn that in her second chance at life, she will not be a bystander but a Champion of Law!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
