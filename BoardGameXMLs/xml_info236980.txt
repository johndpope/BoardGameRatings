			<description>Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this cult manager, there are sinners aplenty, and not all are eager to confess. Each member of your community has 2 hidden traits - one virtuous, one heretical. If you&amp;rsquo;ve earned the favor of their House, you may investigate their reputation. Otherwise, you may appoint them to your seasonal council and watch their work for clues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shrouded Isle began as a jam game for Ludum Dare 33: You Are The Monster. It's created by developers from multiple studios, and published by Kitfox Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Choose a victim to sacrifice every season&lt;br/&gt;-Balance power across 5 political families&lt;br/&gt;-Randomly assigned secret virtues and vices&lt;br/&gt;-Purge the sinners!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
