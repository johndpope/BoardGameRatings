			<description>Halo Conquest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game of Conquest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Eli Silver&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, you play as the legendary Master Chief as you attempt to complete missions of vital importance. The Covenant have once again attacked the UNSC, and you are needed to stop them.&lt;br/&gt;    When you start a new game, you can pick any skulls you want. Like the Halo games, the skulls will make the mission harder. However, if you are using the scoring, they will also multiply your score. Choose a mission, receive your starting equipment, and then set out.&lt;br/&gt;     During your turn, you will advance or retreat, then fire at  the enemy (assuming you have ammo). Afterwards, the enemy will fire back, (assuming the enemy is still alive). You'll have the option to take cover and reduce the likelihood of bieng hit, or stand in the open and get a better shot. You can toss Grenades, snipe the enemy, or bash them to death with a melee. You can also pick up weapons from dead enemies.&lt;br/&gt;     When a zone is clear, you can advance to the next zone, and then the next, hoping to complete your mission.&lt;br/&gt;     Good luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
