			<description>Each of two teams (foxes and hunters) play on their own identical game boards. No team may see the board of the opposite team. Each hunter tries to cature the fox of the same color by getting on the same area as the fox. Movement is one area per turn. After each third move the players have to inform the opposite team of the name of the area he is standing on. There are 1 item of 12 areas and 2 items of 18 areas on each board. If a hunter gets on the same area as the fox of his color and claims the fox to be captured, the hunter has won, if the fox reaches the opposite edge of the game board, the fox has won. In both cases both are eliminated from the game. The last fox captured or escaped decides the winning team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
