							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battlefield</name>
									
			<description>Battlefield is a two-player card game which pits players head-to-head to outscore each other on the line of battle. &lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a deck of medieval warriors, clergy, and royalty, and they play against each other with combined elements of chance and strategy. Occasionally, the plague hits, the spies reveal some hidden potential, or the weather threatens your hopes of victory. Rapid play builds to a climax as weaker forces seldom survive to the last battle, but can still turn the tide in unexpected ways. Will you play to defend a valuable member of the royal family, or sacrifice a band of mercenaries to preserve your own balance of power?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
