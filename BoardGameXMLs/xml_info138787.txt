			<description>In this game players are entrepreneurs who produce, transport and sell goods to 6 European cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game introduces the full business cycle where primary resources need to be bought, transformed into secondary resources (materials) and then into final goods ready to be sold to consumers. Factories are built, upgraded and close down, workers are hired and replaced by machines as players try to maximize their profits observing the environment and the competitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This whole process is embodied into a dynamic economic environment. Cities develop as population migrates, new industries are built, closed or relocated, wages are increased and resources/materials prices fluctuate. Development brings higher demand, which players try to control through advertising.&lt;br/&gt;Players also need to manage the transportation circuit and either invest now for future payoffs (opponents pay more to the owner of a route and the latter earns money when population migrates through his network) or try to handle the long-term costs. &lt;br/&gt;Contracts which will be available each round, will inject players with critical cash (as there are no loans) but ending unfulfilled they will incur penalties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 2 players (and the solo) there is also an automated player who exploits opportunities and antagonizes the players without being complicated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after the round when either all spaces have been built or one player has built all his factories (for the one and two players additional conditions for the automated player may also end the game).&lt;br/&gt;At the end, each player's efficiency will be calculated as a percentage between 0 and 100, taking into account a number of parameters such as cash, sales, production lines, etc.A hidden card, dealt randomly to each player from the beginning, will solve ties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
