			<description>At the start of the two-player card game Marital Bliss, each player draws seven missions that they must complete in secret for their partner over the next seven days. Mission cards range from housework chores (such as taking out the trash) to more complex activities such as organizing a weekend away. Each mission card also has a brownie point option that can be completed for extra points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can choose to discard any number of mission cards at the start of the game if they feel they cannot complete them. Different missions are worth a different number of points, and any uncompleted missions at the end of the week are worth negative points. If the other player guesses a mission you are attempting (or recently completed), then you gain no points for the mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategy cards are mixed with the mission cards and allow players to change the rules of the game by making the other player discard missions, allowing some free guesses, or simply gaining points for a guessed mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players also draw five reward cards and choose the one they would most like to win. A players cards are keep secret from their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points at the end of the week earns a reward card to be used at their discretion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
