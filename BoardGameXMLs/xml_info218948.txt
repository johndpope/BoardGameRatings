			<description>In the bleak future, after the collapse of our modern technological world, most of the structures we hold dearly today are no longer effective. The things that brought us comfort and ease have fallen into disrepair and disuse. Central governments have given way to localized strongmen. In some places the world is nothing but a vast wasteland and in other locals mankind thrives by calling back to its pre-modern lifestyle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through it all men still choose to compete and challenge each other in the various arenas. Auto racing is one of these sports that will not die. But the rules no longer apply. The racing circuits are no longer about speed and guile. Now they resemble high speed demolition derbies. The most famous organized racing competition of them all, the Apocalypse Road, is run by callous thugs and monsters who encourage drivers to arm their cars and literally destroy their opponents. It is the Roman Coliseum reincarnated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over time, new rules and organizational structures have taken hold. Ten teams now complete across the Thunderverse in a season-long show of firepower and twisted metal. Drivers work as part of a team struggling to complete laps under machine gun and even missile fire. The tracks, falling into decades of disrepair, are a jumbled mess of jumps, joker lanes and dirt. Much like the gladiators of old, in a time of intense anguish, the chance to be a hero, even for a day, calls drivers out to risk life and limb for wealth and food. The arena beckons, will you take the wheel?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apocalypse Road is a race game using the Thunder Alley/Grand Prix engine. Players attempt to score points by crossing the finish line (somewhat like roller derby) and by eliminating opposing cars. The first team to 15 points wins the event and gets a double portion of foodstuffs as a reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Apocalypse Road, a race is played to the accumulation of 15 skins for a team. A Skin may be scored in two ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time a car crosses the Finish Line is worth 1 Skin.&lt;br/&gt;    Each opposing car that is eliminated during your activation is worth 1 Skin.&lt;br/&gt;    There is no leading and there is no tracking of lapped cars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
