							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pulse: Volume One</name>
									
			<description>Enter an absorbing world where players become part conductor, part note-captor, part multi-touch master. Tap speeding notes as they cross the radiant pulse to conduct gorgeous original melodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pulse&amp;rsquo;s eight core tracks were composed in-house by Dain Saint and Kerry Gilbert. Beyond those few tracks, we are proud to showcase a variety of music created by talented independent musicians primarily in the Philadelphia area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using Time Signatures to Enrich the Experience&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By adapting the geography of a level to its song&amp;rsquo;s time signature, we were able to create a unique rhythm experience. For example, let&amp;rsquo;s say a particular song has a 4/4 time signature. We&amp;rsquo;ll setup the level to have either 4 or 8 rings. What about a time signature like 3/4 &amp;mdash; for example, a waltz? We&amp;rsquo;ll use 6 rings. Each pulse then represents one to two full measures of that song. This allows a freedom of form rarely seen in rhythm games and really completes the experience. Who says you can&amp;rsquo;t teach an old dog new tricks?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Local Artists and Great Music. Coming Monthly. Free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Music is great. New music is even better. That&amp;rsquo;s why we are releasing 4 new tracks for Pulse each month. These tracks are hand-picked from local Philadelphia independent artists &amp;mdash; many of them written specifically for Pulse! On top of just releasing sick new levels to play, we&amp;rsquo;re conducting interviews with artists and showcasing a growing music community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
