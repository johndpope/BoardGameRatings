			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fantastic Races of the Otherverse series converts the most interesting, unusual and powerful player races from Otherverse Games' D20 Modern-powered settings: Otherverse America, Psi-Watch, Galaxy Command and Black Tokyo, and adapts them for use with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. More than a just simple conversion to the new rule set, these short sourcebooks imagine how heroes from super-scientific worlds would look in campaigns where magic and the divine are the norm. This series of supplements also provides a few new hints at how the vast and interconnected multiverse of Otherverse Games fits together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Galaxy Command, the powerfully built Urloks are an alien race of psychically enhanced warriors. They are known for their courage and sense of honor. The bear like humanoids have recently entered the galactic stage, after a successful first contact by Galaxy Command's heroic astronauts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the Pathfinder Role Playing Game the Urlocks have been re-imagined...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the Urlok's own creation stories, the bear-like giants fell from heaven long ago. Otherworldly and somber, Urloks know the Prime Material Plane as a cosmic penance for racial sins long forgotten. Talk to any Urlok and if you can over come the race's legendary taciturnity, he will tell you that once upon a time, his race were the soldiers of Heaven itself. During a great battle against a legendary cosmic evil, Urlok soldiers fled the battlefield, and for their cowardice the entire race was cast down. Urloks strive to atone for their mythical ancestors' betrayal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Courage and loyalty are foremost virtues for the race, and an Urlok knight would rather die than betray a trust. Oathbreakers and cowards are punished harshly, with the normally noble bear-men reaching extremes of torture and atrocity that give even savage humanoids like Orcs and Hobgoblins pause when punishing traitors within their proud race. Urloks who show fear or even the slightest trace of deception brand and scar themselves with their mightly claws. More severe offenses are punished with the amputation of fingers, hands or even whole arms. Urloks hold themselves to incredibly harsh standards and a completely unscarred Urlok is a one in a million rarity. Among their own kind, the rare unscarred Urloks are treated with a living saint's respect, and a bit of jealous suspicion: are they truly as righteous as they claim, or are they simply too afraid of pain to scar themselves for hidden offenses?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Urloks live far from most other humanoids. They prefer the cold places at the top and bottom of the world. Because of their distance from civilization and their savage and masochistic punishments, the Urloks rarely receive a warm reception in peaceful humanoid kingdoms. Urloks venturing into warmer regions are often mercenaries. Dozens of kingdoms, both good and evil, hire the bear-folk as indomitable shock troops. Urlok tenacity and courage is well known among fighting men, and the race's soldiers will display reserves of bravado and willpower unknown in other races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
