			<description>The game consists of cards showing different animals doing actions (turning around, jumping on one leg, clap hands etc.). Players take turns flipping over two cards from the draw pile and placing them in a row. As soon as a player spots that there are three of the same animal in the row, she has to make the respective animal sound. If three of the same action can be seen, the player must perform the action. The first player to do that wins the three cards (or shares them with others who were as fast). When all cards are used up, whoever won most cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
