			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Real baseball situations are implemented into the game to make it as real as it can get. The game is for one or two players Ages 8 and up. Five Card Baseball is played with a 60 card deck. Flip the cards and watch the game unfold like magic. Witness your opponent walk to first base, steal second and score on a single as you watch helplessly. Defeat your opponent in a realistic 9 inning game. Five Card Baseball can also be played with two or more decks for a more interesting experience.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is for one or two players and involves revealing cards to simulate situations in a baseball game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
