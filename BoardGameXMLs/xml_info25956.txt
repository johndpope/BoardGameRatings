							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jeu du Tour de Belgique Cycliste</name>
									
			<description>This very simple cycling game from Belgium and produced in the early '50s uses a 37x28cm paper map. The game was released a s a promotional game for table-oil. On the map there is a drawing of Belgium with 50 spaces on 50 different towns or cities, this forms the track. Each player controls a team of 2 cyclists, movement is determined by spinning a paper cartwheel that has the numbers 1 to 6 on it (this replaces a die). The winner is the player who reaches the finish (in Brussels) first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
