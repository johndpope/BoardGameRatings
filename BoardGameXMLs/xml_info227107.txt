							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Feudum: Kickstarter Promotional Cards</name>
									
			<description>These eleven (11) cards are from the November 2016 Feudum Kickstarter Campaign.  They are described here in detail, and summarized on this downloadable player aid courtesy of Joshua Acosta : &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/162608/feudum-expansion-promo-royal-writs-official&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/162608/feudum-expansion-p...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. TIME FLIES&lt;br/&gt;If you discard a wood or an iron good, This &amp;quot;Time Flies&amp;quot; Royal Writ Mandate card lets you immediately roll the progress die to draw a region tile. This not only speeds up the game, it earns you a valuable tile! Return the card to the bottom of the Royal Writ deck after use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. SEA SERPENT&lt;br/&gt;This &amp;quot;Sea Serpent&amp;quot; Royal Writ card doubles as an Action Card that you can add to your Action Deck! Once played it remains in play and limits you to 1 less action for all remaining rounds (It may NOT be used with the x2 Repeat Action). Select two of the same (non-feudum) location types (outposts, farms or towns) and place them atop your card. These discs function as ruled locations (even without influence markers!). If you control the sea serpent, gain one ADDITIONAL status star for those locations (3 total) for the purpose of determining your guild status in the related two guilds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. KRUD&lt;br/&gt;This &amp;quot;Krud&amp;quot; Royal Writ Mandate card lets you immediately add a 1 barrel&amp;rsquo;s worth of influence markers to your row in the Knight Guild. If you discard a sulfur, you may add 2 barrel&amp;rsquo;s worth of influence markers! Return the card to the bottom of the Royal Writ deck after use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. REGION TILE&lt;br/&gt;This &amp;quot;Region Tile&amp;quot; Royal Writ Charter card earns veneration points for any collected region tile you still have in your personal supply (not being used as landscapes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. BEHEMOTH&lt;br/&gt;This &amp;quot;Behemoth&amp;quot; Royal Writ card doubles as an Action Card that you can add to your Action Deck! Once played it remains in play and limits you to 1 less action for all remaining rounds (It may NOT be used with the x2 Repeat Action). Select any available feudum and place it atop your card. This disc functions as ruled feudum (even without an influence marker!) and requires NO military service. If you control the behemoth, gain one additional status star in that feudum type for the purposes of determining your guild status in that guild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. RIVER&lt;br/&gt;This &amp;quot;River&amp;quot; Royal Writ Charter card earns veneration points per locations ruled along the river.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7. KING DANIEL&lt;br/&gt;This &amp;quot;King Daniel&amp;quot; Royal Writ card doubles as an Action Card that you can add to your Action Deck! Once played it remains in play and limits you to 1 less action for all remaining round (It may NOT be used with the x2 Repeat Action). Take 1, 2, or 3 king seals from the general supply, depending on the epoch you are in. If you are the starting player, king seals cost 1 less shilling when trading with the Noble Guild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8. NORRIN THE CAT&lt;br/&gt;This &amp;quot;Norrin the Cat&amp;quot; Royal Writ card doubles as an Action Card that you can add to your Action Deck! Once played it remains in play and limits you to 1 less action for all remaining rounds (It may NOT be used with the x2 Repeat Action). Take 1, 2, or 3 vessels from the general supply, depending on the epoch you are in. If you have an alchemist in play, vessels cost 1 less shilling when trading with the Alchemist Guild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9. SAMUEL THE SNAKE&lt;br/&gt;This &amp;quot;Samuel the Snake&amp;quot; Royal Writ card doubles as an Action Card that you can add to your Action Deck! Once played it remains in play and limits you to 1 less action for all remaining rounds (It may NOT be used with the x2 Repeat Action). During the Nourish Pawns Phase, all players (except you) must &amp;ldquo;feed the snake&amp;rdquo; by discarding a food into the haversack! If you have an Noble in play, keep one of the discarded food goods for yourself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10. STAINED GLASSS ABBEY&lt;br/&gt;This &amp;quot;Stained Glass Abbey&amp;quot; Royal Writ Mandate card lets you randomly draw 2 rosary beads from the general supply, and then keep the highest bead!

SWORD OF LEINAD&lt;br/&gt;This &amp;quot;Sword of Leinad&amp;quot; Royal Writ Mandate card adds +3 to a single conquer action.
