			<description>This is a Swedish educative game where the player learns how to use and converse through sign language. The game is divided in two different games that are played on the same board but with a different cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the games is called Teckenspelet (the sign game), where one player takes a card with a picture of a person preforming a sign, and imitates it. Then the other players then tries to guess what the sign means.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other game is called Meningsspelet (the sentence game). In this game you use the cards to create short sentences. This is done by small images of the sentence on the cards, with numbers telling where in the sentence they should be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
