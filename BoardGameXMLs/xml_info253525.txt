							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Let These Mermaids Touch Your Dick Maybe</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its been such a long day in the sun. The ocean waves lap against the sandy shore in hushed refrains and as you stretch out on a smooth rock outcropping, you hear the gentle chorus of mermaids. Their song fills the air like warm caramel, and as the sun glitters off the sparkles of seawater and sand spread out over your stomach, the mermaids melody massages your weary muscles. It feels nice, the warmth of the sun, the soothing songs of sensuous sea cryptids.  You tease and laugh, you giggle in the sun and the spray as the mermaids reach for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game about dick touching, maybe. I should make that clear up front. If you're not on board with telling the story of a bunch of mermaids maybe touching your dick this may not be the best game to play right now and if that's the case, that's totally chill. There's so many games out there to play that don't involve mermaids possibly touching your dick, find one of those and have a blast, friend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're intrigued by mermaids maybe touching your dick but aren't totally sure if you're comfortable acting it out, much less in front of other people, it's totally fine to use this as a fantasizing exercise.You can play this game alone if you want, or you can just read this text and imagine. I won't judge either way, your comfort and tastes are yours, friend. I made this for you to enjoy and I want you to feel comfortable enjoying it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're feeling like you're about hypothetical mermaid dick touching, well damn, I've got a really good game for you to play with some friends, and it's this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
