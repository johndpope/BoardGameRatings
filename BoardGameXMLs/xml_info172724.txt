							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dimgaard Campaign Guide</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dimgaard is both a low-fantasy and a high fantasy campaign. It accommodates all allowable race and class options, however, the more fantastic a character build, the more a character will encounter obstacles during his/her adventuring. The setting is distinctly human-centric and is based heavily on the cultures of Dark Ages Europe and Pre-Columbian Americas. So the inhabitants are mostly (by far) humans who are superstitious and xenophobic. Most have never seen a halfling or dwarf let alone an elf, tiefling, half-orc, or dragonborn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a low-wealth, low-magic campaign. As a 1st level character begins adventuring, for most classes, his/her starting money puts him well into the upper middle class of most Dimgaard communities. Players should expect their characters to mostly be using their inherent abilities along with mundane equipment rather than expecting to come across magic items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
