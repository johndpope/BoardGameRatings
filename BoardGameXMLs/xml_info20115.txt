			<description>The players sit around the spinning board.  Two knowledge cards and one spin card are given to each player.  The arrow is then spun.  The letter it points to is the word-start letter.  The arrow is spun again and the person it points to must say a letter.  This letter must follow on from the word-start letter.  Play continues until a word is finished that cannot be extended.  If a player is successfully challenged (a &amp;lsquo;finished&amp;rsquo; word can still be extended) the player forfeits a knowledge card.  The spin card is used when a player can&amp;rsquo;t think of a way of extending a word or bluffing.  When a player loses both their knowledge cards they become a non-entity and are out of the game.  However they still play a role.  Non-entities must be completely ignored.  If a surviving player acknowledges a non-entity they lose a knowledge card.  The winner is the last survivor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
