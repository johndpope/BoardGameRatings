			<description>TOCA World Touring Cars (called Jarrett &amp;amp; Labonte Stock Car Racing in the USA and WTC: World Touring Car Championship in Japan) is a racing video game developed and published by Codemasters, and released in 2000 for PlayStation and Game Boy Advance. It is part of the TOCA Touring Car series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It features various Touring Car championships from around the world, but despite carrying the TOCA name, a fully licensed British Touring Car Championship series was not included. This upset a lot of fans of the series, but success continued. The gameplay overall became more &amp;quot;arcadey&amp;quot; and the replacement of qualifying laps with random grid positions together with the omission of penalties for bad driving made the game much more playable for the casual gamer. The game was billed as the first PlayStation game to feature 14 cars on the track, which pushed the console to its absolute limit. Curiously, unlike the first two titles in the TOCA series, World Touring Cars was not released in a Windows version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;TOCA World Touring Cars&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
