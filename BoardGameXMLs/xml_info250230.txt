							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ruined City Scavenger</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your lungs gasp for fresher air as you climb up the last few rungs leading out of the filthy sewers from below. Though grateful for the discovery of a safe passage into the city, you cannot help but to think that there must have been an easier way. As you clean yourself off the best you can you realize that in the murky darkness below you lost the knife you were carrying as well as a bottle of much needed boost capsules. You'll need to find replacements if you wish to make it out of this doomed place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you cautiously work your way through the debris of the back alleys you reflect upon your mission. Welltown Settlement, your home, was considered to be an oasis amongst the parched decay of the surrounding wastes. That was until recently, however, when your community's well purifier was demolished by some of the degenerates of this blasted city. Your people will die of thirst if they don't get replacement parts to fix the purifier. Being the best scavenger in the land you couldn't help but to volunteer yourself for the mission. After all, you share the same fate as the rest of the settlement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being lost in thought you fail to notice the advance of an overgrown, mutated rat until the last second. Lacking a weapon you rely on your fists to bash the creature in the head, causing the rat to drop to the ground just seconds before its filthy teeth and claws tore into your flesh. You finish the creature off before it can recover from the blow. Though foul smelling, the flesh of a rat like this would provide you with a much needed meal later on. For now though, you are not hungry. You leave the carcass of the rat behind, knowing good and well that something else will quickly claim it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you cross the crumbling remains of a once prominent street you notice a metallic shimmer coming from a nearby trash heap. After checking for potential hazards you make your way over to the trash heap and carefully start digging through the junk. Your keen eyes reward you with a machete! A most wonderful find indeed! You're gonna need this if you wish to survive your eventual battle against Trok the Mighty, the city's mutant champion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complete, solo player game that is played by using a symbol filled maze, a pencil, and a pair of six sided dice. This particular adventure game is set in a mutant filled post apocalypse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
