			<description>Throne Wars is a kingdom battle game for two to four players. Each player starts the game with a Strong Hold card in play, which represents the center of their kingdom. Each player takes turns playing each phase of the game. During each turn players roll dice to represent sending out their peasants to do work for the kingdom. Sometimes these peasants comply and other times they do not. Once the dice are rolled, they are assigned to the corresponding decks. There are 5 decks in all; Fortification (deck 2), Assault (deck 3), Development (deck 4), Devine (deck 5), and Siege (deck 6), there is no deck for 1. If the players have rolled a 1, this peasant decided to slack off and did nothing, so it is assigned to no deck. Players are then able to draw a card for each die they rolled.&lt;br/&gt;Players may draw a card from whatever deck the die was assigned to or any deck below that one in number. For example, if a player rolled a 5, this die is assigned to the 5 deck and the player may choose to draw from the 5 deck or any deck below that one in descending order. In this way, players are able to choose cards from decks strategically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once players have drawn their cards, play then moves into the Fortification phase. During this phase, players may play any fortification cards they drew. Fortification cards build up the player&amp;rsquo;s kingdom; they provide a buffer for the Strong Hold. These cards represent towers, walls, and gatehouses. Once each player has done this, play moves on to the Siege phase. During this phase, players play and fire siege equipment such as ballista and catapults. These cards directly target the fortifications of the opposing player.&lt;br/&gt;Players then move on to the Assault phase of the game. During this phase, players play any Assault cards they drew. These cards make up the troops that will be played to attack an opposing player&amp;rsquo;s Strong Hold. These cards have Footmen, Archers, etc. These Assault cards then are able to attack an opposing player&amp;rsquo;s Strong Hold. However, the total power of an assault force is only able to damage a Strong Hold if it is greater than the total amount of Fortification the opposing player possesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout all the phases, players are able to build developments and use divine powers (draw from those respective decks) to support their tactics. These cards can be a devastating and tide turning strategy to employ. These cards include; Hand of God, Sapper Bomb, Siege Ladder, Blacksmith, etc. Play continues through these phases until a player&amp;rsquo;s Strong Hold has been reduced to (0).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a fast paced game of strategy and luck. The theme is fantasy medieval combat and focuses on divine catholic inspired societal norms of the day. Throughout the game, players feel as though they are in charge of a kingdom and are working to overtake their opponent&amp;rsquo;s kingdom through force of arms and smart planning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
