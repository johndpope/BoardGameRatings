			<description>Each player is given a plastic card holder with twenty-five slots arranged to make ten hands of five cards; five rows and five columns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A standard deck of cards is used; two decks is there are more than two players. Every round begins with each player being dealt a card and placing it in one's own rack secretly. Each player is trying to make the best possible poker hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the racks are filled, the players use their ten betting discs, numbered one through ten, to bet on which of their hands will beat the other playing in each rack position. A player should put the higher numbered discs on the hands in which one has the most confidence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the bets have been made, the hands are revealed and the player who has the best hands in each position wins the chips bet by everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the winners of all ten hands have been rewarded, the player who has the highest total in chips is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
